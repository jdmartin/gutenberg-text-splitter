      CHAPTER I. THE PICKWICKIANS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he first ray of
      light which illumines the gloom, and converts into a dazzling brilliancy
      that obscurity in which the earlier history of the public career of the
      immortal Pickwick would appear to be involved, is derived from the perusal
      of the following entry in the Transactions of the Pickwick Club, which the
      editor of these papers feels the highest pleasure in laying before his
      readers, as a proof of the careful attention, indefatigable assiduity, and
      nice discrimination, with which his search among the multifarious
      documents confided to him has been conducted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May 12, 1827. Joseph Smiggers, Esq., P.V.P.M.P.C. [Perpetual
      Vice-President&mdash;Member Pickwick Club], presiding. The following
      resolutions unanimously agreed to:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That this Association has heard read, with feelings of unmingled
      satisfaction, and unqualified approval, the paper communicated by Samuel
      Pickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C. [General Chairman&mdash;Member Pickwick Club],
      entitled &ldquo;Speculations on the Source of the Hampstead Ponds, with some
      Observations on the Theory of Tittlebats;&rdquo; and that this Association does
      hereby return its warmest thanks to the said Samuel Pickwick, Esq.,
      G.C.M.P.C., for the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That while this Association is deeply sensible of the advantages which
      must accrue to the cause of science, from the production to which they
      have just adverted&mdash;no less than from the unwearied researches of
      Samuel Pickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C., in Hornsey, Highgate, Brixton, and
      Camberwell&mdash;they cannot but entertain a lively sense of the
      inestimable benefits which must inevitably result from carrying the
      speculations of that learned man into a wider field, from extending his
      travels, and, consequently, enlarging his sphere of observation, to the
      advancement of knowledge, and the diffusion of learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That, with the view just mentioned, this Association has taken into its
      serious consideration a proposal, emanating from the aforesaid, Samuel
      Pickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C., and three other Pickwickians hereinafter
      named, for forming a new branch of United Pickwickians, under the title of
      The Corresponding Society of the Pickwick Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That the said proposal has received the sanction and approval of this
      Association.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That the Corresponding Society of the Pickwick Club is therefore hereby
      constituted; and that Samuel Pickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C., Tracy Tupman,
      Esq., M.P.C., Augustus Snodgrass, Esq., M.P.C., and Nathaniel Winkle,
      Esq., M.P.C., are hereby nominated and appointed members of the same; and
      that they be requested to forward, from time to time, authenticated
      accounts of their journeys and investigations, of their observations of
      character and manners, and of the whole of their adventures, together with
      all tales and papers to which local scenery or associations may give rise,
      to the Pickwick Club, stationed in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That this Association cordially recognises the principle of every member
      of the Corresponding Society defraying his own travelling expenses; and
      that it sees no objection whatever to the members of the said society
      pursuing their inquiries for any length of time they please, upon the same
      terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That the members of the aforesaid Corresponding Society be, and are
      hereby informed, that their proposal to pay the postage of their letters,
      and the carriage of their parcels, has been deliberated upon by this
      Association: that this Association considers such proposal worthy of the
      great minds from which it emanated, and that it hereby signifies its
      perfect acquiescence therein.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A casual observer, adds the secretary, to whose notes we are indebted for
      the following account&mdash;a casual observer might possibly have remarked
      nothing extraordinary in the bald head, and circular spectacles, which
      were intently turned towards his (the secretary&rsquo;s) face, during the
      reading of the above resolutions: to those who knew that the gigantic
      brain of Pickwick was working beneath that forehead, and that the beaming
      eyes of Pickwick were twinkling behind those glasses, the sight was indeed
      an interesting one. There sat the man who had traced to their source the
      mighty ponds of Hampstead, and agitated the scientific world with his
      Theory of Tittlebats, as calm and unmoved as the deep waters of the one on
      a frosty day, or as a solitary specimen of the other in the inmost
      recesses of an earthen jar. And how much more interesting did the
      spectacle become, when, starting into full life and animation, as a
      simultaneous call for &lsquo;Pickwick&rsquo; burst from his followers, that
      illustrious man slowly mounted into the Windsor chair, on which he had
      been previously seated, and addressed the club himself had founded. What a
      study for an artist did that exciting scene present! The eloquent
      Pickwick, with one hand gracefully concealed behind his coat tails, and
      the other waving in air to assist his glowing declamation; his elevated
      position revealing those tights and gaiters, which, had they clothed an
      ordinary man, might have passed without observation, but which, when
      Pickwick clothed them&mdash;if we may use the expression&mdash;inspired
      involuntary awe and respect; surrounded by the men who had volunteered to
      share the perils of his travels, and who were destined to participate in
      the glories of his discoveries. On his right sat Mr. Tracy Tupman&mdash;the
      too susceptible Tupman, who to the wisdom and experience of maturer years
      superadded the enthusiasm and ardour of a boy in the most interesting and
      pardonable of human weaknesses&mdash;love. Time and feeding had expanded
      that once romantic form; the black silk waistcoat had become more and more
      developed; inch by inch had the gold watch-chain beneath it disappeared
      from within the range of Tupman&rsquo;s vision; and gradually had the capacious
      chin encroached upon the borders of the white cravat: but the soul of
      Tupman had known no change&mdash;admiration of the fair sex was still its
      ruling passion. On the left of his great leader sat the poetic Snodgrass,
      and near him again the sporting Winkle; the former poetically enveloped in
      a mysterious blue cloak with a canine-skin collar, and the latter
      communicating additional lustre to a new green shooting-coat, plaid
      neckerchief, and closely-fitted drabs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s oration upon this occasion, together with the debate
      thereon, is entered on the Transactions of the Club. Both bear a strong
      affinity to the discussions of other celebrated bodies; and, as it is
      always interesting to trace a resemblance between the proceedings of great
      men, we transfer the entry to these pages.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick observed (says the secretary) that fame was dear to the
      heart of every man. Poetic fame was dear to the heart of his friend
      Snodgrass; the fame of conquest was equally dear to his friend Tupman; and
      the desire of earning fame in the sports of the field, the air, and the
      water was uppermost in the breast of his friend Winkle. He (Mr. Pickwick)
      would not deny that he was influenced by human passions and human feelings
      (cheers)&mdash;possibly by human weaknesses (loud cries of &ldquo;No&rdquo;); but this
      he would say, that if ever the fire of self-importance broke out in his
      bosom, the desire to benefit the human race in preference effectually
      quenched it. The praise of mankind was his swing; philanthropy was his
      insurance office. (Vehement cheering.) He had felt some pride&mdash;he
      acknowledged it freely, and let his enemies make the most of it&mdash;he
      had felt some pride when he presented his Tittlebatian Theory to the
      world; it might be celebrated or it might not. (A cry of &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; and
      great cheering.) He would take the assertion of that honourable
      Pickwickian whose voice he had just heard&mdash;it was celebrated; but if
      the fame of that treatise were to extend to the farthest confines of the
      known world, the pride with which he should reflect on the authorship of
      that production would be as nothing compared with the pride with which he
      looked around him, on this, the proudest moment of his existence.
      (Cheers.) He was a humble individual. (&ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;) Still he could not but
      feel that they had selected him for a service of great honour, and of some
      danger. Travelling was in a troubled state, and the minds of coachmen were
      unsettled. Let them look abroad and contemplate the scenes which were
      enacting around them. Stage-coaches were upsetting in all directions,
      horses were bolting, boats were overturning, and boilers were bursting.
      (Cheers&mdash;a voice &ldquo;No.&rdquo;) No! (Cheers.) Let that honourable Pickwickian
      who cried &ldquo;No&rdquo; so loudly come forward and deny it, if he could. (Cheers.)
      Who was it that cried &ldquo;No&rdquo;? (Enthusiastic cheering.) Was it some vain and
      disappointed man&mdash;he would not say haberdasher (loud cheers)&mdash;who,
      jealous of the praise which had been&mdash;perhaps undeservedly&mdash;bestowed
      on his (Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s) researches, and smarting under the censure which
      had been heaped upon his own feeble attempts at rivalry, now took this
      vile and calumnious mode of&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MR. BLOTTON (of Aldgate) rose to order. Did the honourable Pickwickian
      allude to him? (Cries of &ldquo;Order,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chair,&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; &ldquo;Leave
      off,&rdquo; etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MR. PICKWICK would not put up to be put down by clamour. He had alluded
      to the honourable gentleman. (Great excitement.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MR. BLOTTON would only say then, that he repelled the hon. gent.&lsquo;s false
      and scurrilous accusation, with profound contempt. (Great cheering.) The
      hon. gent. was a humbug. (Immense confusion, and loud cries of &ldquo;Chair,&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;Order.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. A. SNODGRASS rose to order. He threw himself upon the chair. (Hear.)
      He wished to know whether this disgraceful contest between two members of
      that club should be allowed to continue. (Hear, hear.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The CHAIRMAN was quite sure the hon. Pickwickian would withdraw the
      expression he had just made use of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MR. BLOTTON, with all possible respect for the chair, was quite sure he
      would not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The CHAIRMAN felt it his imperative duty to demand of the honourable
      gentleman, whether he had used the expression which had just escaped him
      in a common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MR. BLOTTON had no hesitation in saying that he had not&mdash;he had used
      the word in its Pickwickian sense. (Hear, hear.) He was bound to
      acknowledge that, personally, he entertained the highest regard and esteem
      for the honourable gentleman; he had merely considered him a humbug in a
      Pickwickian point of view. (Hear, hear.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MR. PICKWICK felt much gratified by the fair, candid, and full
      explanation of his honourable friend. He begged it to be at once
      understood, that his own observations had been merely intended to bear a
      Pickwickian construction. (Cheers.)&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the entry terminates, as we have no doubt the debate did also, after
      arriving at such a highly satisfactory and intelligible point. We have no
      official statement of the facts which the reader will find recorded in the
      next chapter, but they have been carefully collated from letters and other
      MS. authorities, so unquestionably genuine as to justify their narration
      in a connected form.

      CHAPTER II. THE FIRST DAY&rsquo;S JOURNEY, AND THE FIRST EVENING&rsquo;S ADVENTURES;
      WITH THEIR CONSEQUENCES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span> hat punctual
      servant of all work, the sun, had just risen, and begun to strike a light
      on the morning of the thirteenth of May, one thousand eight hundred and
      twenty-seven, when Mr. Samuel Pickwick burst like another sun from his
      slumbers, threw open his chamber window, and looked out upon the world
      beneath. Goswell Street was at his feet, Goswell Street was on his right
      hand&mdash;as far as the eye could reach, Goswell Street extended on his
      left; and the opposite side of Goswell Street was over the way. &lsquo;Such,&rsquo; 
      thought Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;are the narrow views of those philosophers who,
      content with examining the things that lie before them, look not to the
      truths which are hidden beyond. As well might I be content to gaze on
      Goswell Street for ever, without one effort to penetrate to the hidden
      countries which on every side surround it.&rsquo; And having given vent to this
      beautiful reflection, Mr. Pickwick proceeded to put himself into his
      clothes, and his clothes into his portmanteau. Great men are seldom over
      scrupulous in the arrangement of their attire; the operation of shaving,
      dressing, and coffee-imbibing was soon performed; and, in another hour,
      Mr. Pickwick, with his portmanteau in his hand, his telescope in his
      greatcoat pocket, and his note-book in his waistcoat, ready for the
      reception of any discoveries worthy of being noted down, had arrived at
      the coach-stand in St. Martin&rsquo;s-le-Grand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cab!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here you are, sir,&rsquo; shouted a strange specimen of the human race, in a
      sackcloth coat, and apron of the same, who, with a brass label and number
      round his neck, looked as if he were catalogued in some collection of
      rarities. This was the waterman. &lsquo;Here you are, sir. Now, then, fust cab!&rsquo; 
      And the first cab having been fetched from the public-house, where he had
      been smoking his first pipe, Mr. Pickwick and his portmanteau were thrown
      into the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Golden Cross,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only a bob&rsquo;s vorth, Tommy,&rsquo; cried the driver sulkily, for the information
      of his friend the waterman, as the cab drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How old is that horse, my friend?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, rubbing his
      nose with the shilling he had reserved for the fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forty-two,&rsquo; replied the driver, eyeing him askant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, laying his hand upon his note-book. The
      driver reiterated his former statement. Mr. Pickwick looked very hard at
      the man&rsquo;s face, but his features were immovable, so he noted down the fact
      forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how long do you keep him out at a time?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick,
      searching for further information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two or three veeks,&rsquo; replied the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Weeks!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick in astonishment, and out came the note-book
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He lives at Pentonwil when he&rsquo;s at home,&rsquo; observed the driver coolly,
      &lsquo;but we seldom takes him home, on account of his weakness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On account of his weakness!&rsquo; reiterated the perplexed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He always falls down when he&rsquo;s took out o&rsquo; the cab,&rsquo; continued the
      driver, &lsquo;but when he&rsquo;s in it, we bears him up werry tight, and takes him
      in werry short, so as he can&rsquo;t werry well fall down; and we&rsquo;ve got a pair
      o&rsquo; precious large wheels on, so ven he does move, they run after him, and
      he must go on&mdash;he can&rsquo;t help it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick entered every word of this statement in his note-book, with
      the view of communicating it to the club, as a singular instance of the
      tenacity of life in horses under trying circumstances. The entry was
      scarcely completed when they reached the Golden Cross. Down jumped the
      driver, and out got Mr. Pickwick. Mr. Tupman, Mr. Snodgrass, and Mr.
      Winkle, who had been anxiously waiting the arrival of their illustrious
      leader, crowded to welcome him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s your fare,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, holding out the shilling to the
      driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the learned man&rsquo;s astonishment, when that unaccountable person
      flung the money on the pavement, and requested in figurative terms to be allowed
      the pleasure of fighting him (Mr. Pickwick) for the amount!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are mad,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or drunk,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or both,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come on!&rsquo; said the cab-driver, sparring away like clockwork. &lsquo;Come on&mdash;all
      four on you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a lark!&rsquo; shouted half a dozen hackney coachmen. &lsquo;Go to vork, Sam!&mdash;and
      they crowded with great glee round the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the row, Sam?&rsquo; inquired one gentleman in black calico sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Row!&rsquo; replied the cabman, &lsquo;what did he want my number for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t want your number,&rsquo; said the astonished Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you take it for, then?&rsquo; inquired the cabman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t take it,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would anybody believe,&rsquo; continued the cab-driver, appealing to the crowd,
      &lsquo;would anybody believe as an informer&rsquo;ud go about in a man&rsquo;s cab, not only
      takin&rsquo; down his number, but ev&rsquo;ry word he says into the bargain&rsquo; (a light
      flashed upon Mr. Pickwick&mdash;it was the note-book).
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he though?&rsquo; inquired another cabman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, did he,&rsquo; replied the first; &lsquo;and then arter aggerawatin&rsquo; me to
      assault him, gets three witnesses here to prove it. But I&rsquo;ll give it him,
      if I&rsquo;ve six months for it. Come on!&rsquo; and the cabman dashed his hat upon
      the ground, with a reckless disregard of his own private property, and
      knocked Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s spectacles off, and followed up the attack with a
      blow on Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s nose, and another on Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s chest, and a
      third in Mr. Snodgrass&rsquo;s eye, and a fourth, by way of variety, in Mr.
      Tupman&rsquo;s waistcoat, and then danced into the road, and then back again to
      the pavement, and finally dashed the whole temporary supply of breath out
      of Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s body; and all in half a dozen seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s an officer?&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Put &lsquo;em under the pump,&rsquo; suggested a hot-pieman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall smart for this,&rsquo; gasped Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Informers!&rsquo; shouted the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; cried the cabman, who had been sparring without cessation the
      whole time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mob hitherto had been passive spectators of the scene, but as the
      intelligence of the Pickwickians being informers was spread among them,
      they began to canvass with considerable vivacity the propriety of
      enforcing the heated pastry-vendor&rsquo;s proposition: and there is no saying
      what acts of personal aggression they might have committed, had not the
      affray been unexpectedly terminated by the interposition of a new-comer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the fun?&rsquo; said a rather tall, thin, young man, in a green coat,
      emerging suddenly from the coach-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Informers!&rsquo; shouted the crowd again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are not,&rsquo; roared Mr. Pickwick, in a tone which, to any dispassionate
      listener, carried conviction with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t you, though&mdash;ain&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said the young man, appealing to Mr.
      Pickwick, and making his way through the crowd by the infallible process
      of elbowing the countenances of its component members.
    </p>
    <p>
      That learned man in a few hurried words explained the real state of the
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come along, then,&rsquo; said he of the green coat, lugging Mr. Pickwick after
      him by main force, and talking the whole way. Here, No. 924, take your
      fare, and take yourself off&mdash;respectable gentleman&mdash;know him
      well&mdash;none of your nonsense&mdash;this way, sir&mdash;where&rsquo;s your
      friends?&mdash;all a mistake, I see&mdash;never mind&mdash;accidents will
      happen&mdash;best regulated families&mdash;never say die&mdash;down upon
      your luck&mdash;Pull him <i>up</i>&mdash;Put that in his pipe&mdash;like
      the flavour&mdash;damned rascals.&rsquo; And with a lengthened string of similar
      broken sentences, delivered with extraordinary volubility, the stranger
      led the way to the traveller&rsquo;s waiting-room, whither he was closely
      followed by Mr. Pickwick and his disciples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, waiter!&rsquo; shouted the stranger, ringing the bell with tremendous
      violence, &lsquo;glasses round&mdash;brandy-and-water, hot and strong, and
      sweet, and plenty,&mdash;eye damaged, Sir? Waiter! raw beef-steak for the
      gentleman&rsquo;s eye&mdash;nothing like raw beef-steak for a bruise, sir; cold
      lamp-post very good, but lamp-post inconvenient&mdash;damned odd standing
      in the open street half an hour, with your eye against a lamp-post&mdash;eh,&mdash;very
      good&mdash;ha! ha!&rsquo; And the stranger, without stopping to take breath,
      swallowed at a draught full half a pint of the reeking brandy-and-water,
      and flung himself into a chair with as much ease as if nothing uncommon
      had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      While his three companions were busily engaged in proffering their thanks
      to their new acquaintance, Mr. Pickwick had leisure to examine his costume
      and appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about the middle height, but the thinness of his body, and the
      length of his legs, gave him the appearance of being much taller. The
      green coat had been a smart dress garment in the days of swallow-tails,
      but had evidently in those times adorned a much shorter man than the
      stranger, for the soiled and faded sleeves scarcely reached to his wrists.
      It was buttoned closely up to his chin, at the imminent hazard of
      splitting the back; and an old stock, without a vestige of shirt collar,
      ornamented his neck. His scanty black trousers displayed here and there
      those shiny patches which bespeak long service, and were strapped very
      tightly over a pair of patched and mended shoes, as if to conceal the
      dirty white stockings, which were nevertheless distinctly visible. His
      long, black hair escaped in negligent waves from beneath each side of his
      old pinched-up hat; and glimpses of his bare wrists might be observed
      between the tops of his gloves and the cuffs of his coat sleeves. His face
      was thin and haggard; but an indescribable air of jaunty impudence and
      perfect self-possession pervaded the whole man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the individual on whom Mr. Pickwick gazed through his spectacles
      (which he had fortunately recovered), and to whom he proceeded, when his
      friends had exhausted themselves, to return in chosen terms his warmest
      thanks for his recent assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said the stranger, cutting the address very short, &lsquo;said
      enough&mdash;no more; smart chap that cabman&mdash;handled his fives well;
      but if I&rsquo;d been your friend in the green jemmy&mdash;damn me&mdash;punch
      his head,&mdash;&lsquo;cod I would,&mdash;pig&rsquo;s whisper&mdash;pieman too,&mdash;no
      gammon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This coherent speech was interrupted by the entrance of the Rochester
      coachman, to announce that &lsquo;the Commodore&rsquo; was on the point of starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Commodore!&rsquo; said the stranger, starting up, &lsquo;my coach&mdash;place booked,&mdash;one
      outside&mdash;leave you to pay for the brandy-and-water,&mdash;want change
      for a five,&mdash;bad silver&mdash;Brummagem buttons&mdash;won&rsquo;t do&mdash;no
      go&mdash;eh?&rsquo; and he shook his head most knowingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it so happened that Mr. Pickwick and his three companions had resolved
      to make Rochester their first halting-place too; and having intimated to
      their new-found acquaintance that they were journeying to the same city,
      they agreed to occupy the seat at the back of the coach, where they could
      all sit together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Up with you,&rsquo; said the stranger, assisting Mr. Pickwick on to the roof
      with so much precipitation as to impair the gravity of that gentleman&rsquo;s
      deportment very materially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any luggage, Sir?&rsquo; inquired the coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&mdash;I? Brown paper parcel here, that&rsquo;s all&mdash;other luggage gone
      by water&mdash;packing-cases, nailed up&mdash;big as houses&mdash;heavy,
      heavy, damned heavy,&rsquo; replied the stranger, as he forced into his pocket
      as much as he could of the brown paper parcel, which presented most
      suspicious indications of containing one shirt and a handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heads, heads&mdash;take care of your heads!&rsquo; cried the loquacious
      stranger, as they came out under the low archway, which in those days
      formed the entrance to the coach-yard. &lsquo;Terrible place&mdash;dangerous
      work&mdash;other day&mdash;five children&mdash;mother&mdash;tall lady,
      eating sandwiches&mdash;forgot the arch&mdash;crash&mdash;knock&mdash;children
      look round&mdash;mother&rsquo;s head off&mdash;sandwich in her hand&mdash;no
      mouth to put it in&mdash;head of a family off&mdash;shocking, shocking!
      Looking at Whitehall, sir?&mdash;fine place&mdash;little window&mdash;somebody
      else&rsquo;s head off there, eh, sir?&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t keep a sharp look-out
      enough either&mdash;eh, Sir, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am ruminating,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;on the strange mutability of human
      affairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I see&mdash;in at the palace door one day, out at the window the
      next. Philosopher, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An observer of human nature, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, so am I. Most people are when they&rsquo;ve little to do and less to get.
      Poet, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friend Mr. Snodgrass has a strong poetic turn,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So have I,&rsquo; said the stranger. &lsquo;Epic poem&mdash;ten thousand lines&mdash;revolution
      of July&mdash;composed it on the spot&mdash;Mars by day, Apollo by night&mdash;bang
      the field-piece, twang the lyre.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were present at that glorious scene, sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Present! think I was;* fired a musket&mdash;fired with an idea&mdash;rushed
      into wine shop&mdash;wrote it down&mdash;back again&mdash;whiz, bang&mdash;another

      Winkle.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          * A remarkable instance of the prophetic force of Mr.
          Jingle&rsquo;s imagination; this dialogue occurring in the year
          1827, and the Revolution in 1830.

    <p>
      &lsquo;A little, Sir,&rsquo; replied that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fine pursuit, sir&mdash;fine pursuit.&mdash;Dogs, Sir?&rsquo;

    <p>
      &lsquo;Not just now,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.

    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Singular circumstance that,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Will you allow me to
      make a note of it?&rsquo;

      &lsquo;Certainly, Sir, certainly&mdash;hundred more anecdotes of the same
      animal.&mdash;Fine girl, Sir&rsquo; (to Mr. Tracy Tupman, who had been bestowing
      sundry anti-Pickwickian glances on a young lady by the roadside).
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very!&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;English girls not so fine as Spanish&mdash;noble creatures&mdash;jet hair&mdash;black
      eyes&mdash;lovely forms&mdash;sweet creatures&mdash;beautiful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been in Spain, sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Tracy Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lived there&mdash;ages.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Many conquests, sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Conquests! Thousands. Don Bolaro Fizzgig&mdash;grandee&mdash;only
      daughter&mdash;Donna Christina&mdash;splendid creature&mdash;loved me to
      distraction&mdash;jealous father&mdash;high-souled daughter&mdash;handsome

      ecstasies&mdash;consent to our union&mdash;join hands and floods of tears&mdash;romantic
      story&mdash;very.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is the lady in England now, sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Tupman, on whom the
      description of her charms had produced a powerful impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dead, sir&mdash;dead,&rsquo; said the stranger, applying to his right eye the
      brief remnant of a very old cambric handkerchief. &lsquo;Never recovered the
      stomach pump&mdash;undermined constitution&mdash;fell a victim.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And her father?&rsquo; inquired the poetic Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Remorse and misery,&rsquo; replied the stranger. &lsquo;Sudden disappearance&mdash;talk
      of the whole city&mdash;search made everywhere without success&mdash;public
      fountain in the great square suddenly ceased playing&mdash;weeks elapsed&mdash;still
      a stoppage&mdash;workmen employed to clean it&mdash;water drawn off&mdash;father-in-law
      discovered sticking head first in the main pipe, with a full confession in
      his right boot&mdash;took him out, and the fountain played away again, as
      well as ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you allow me to note that little romance down, Sir?&rsquo; said Mr.
      Snodgrass, deeply affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, Sir, certainly&mdash;fifty more if you like to hear &lsquo;em&mdash;strange
      life mine&mdash;rather curious history&mdash;not extraordinary, but
      singular.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this strain, with an occasional glass of ale, by way of parenthesis,
      when the coach changed horses, did the stranger proceed, until they
      reached Rochester bridge, by which time the note-books, both of Mr.
      Pickwick and Mr. Snodgrass, were completely filled with selections from
      his adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Magnificent ruin!&rsquo; said Mr. Augustus Snodgrass, with all the poetic
      fervour that distinguished him, when they came in sight of the fine old
      castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a study for an antiquarian!&rsquo; were the very words which fell from Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s mouth, as he applied his telescope to his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! fine place,&rsquo; said the stranger, &lsquo;glorious pile&mdash;frowning walls&mdash;tottering
      arches&mdash;dark nooks&mdash;crumbling staircases&mdash;old cathedral too&mdash;earthy
      smell&mdash;pilgrims&rsquo; feet wore away the old steps&mdash;little Saxon
      doors&mdash;confessionals like money-takers&rsquo; boxes at theatres&mdash;queer
      customers those monks&mdash;popes, and lord treasurers, and all sorts of
      old fellows, with great red faces, and broken noses, turning up every day&mdash;buff
      jerkins too&mdash;match-locks&mdash;sarcophagus&mdash;fine place&mdash;old
      legends too&mdash;strange stories: capital;&rsquo; and the stranger continued to
      soliloquise until they reached the Bull Inn, in the High Street, where the
      coach stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you remain here, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Nathaniel Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&mdash;not I&mdash;but you&rsquo;d better&mdash;good house&mdash;nice beds&mdash;Wright&rsquo;s
      next house, dear&mdash;very dear&mdash;half-a-crown in the bill if you
      look at the waiter&mdash;charge you more if you dine at a friend&rsquo;s than
      they would if you dined in the coffee-room&mdash;rum fellows&mdash;very.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle turned to Mr. Pickwick, and murmured a few words; a whisper
      passed from Mr. Pickwick to Mr. Snodgrass, from Mr. Snodgrass to Mr.
      Tupman, and nods of assent were exchanged. Mr. Pickwick addressed the
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You rendered us a very important service this morning, sir,&rsquo; said he,
      &lsquo;will you allow us to offer a slight mark of our gratitude by begging the
      favour of your company at dinner?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Great pleasure&mdash;not presume to dictate, but broiled fowl and
      mushrooms&mdash;capital thing! What time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me see,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, referring to his watch, &lsquo;it is now
      nearly three. Shall we say five?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suit me excellently,&rsquo; said the stranger, &lsquo;five precisely&mdash;till then&mdash;care
      of yourselves;&rsquo; and lifting the pinched-up hat a few inches from his head,
      and carelessly replacing it very much on one side, the stranger, with half
      the brown paper parcel sticking out of his pocket, walked briskly up the
      yard, and turned into the High Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Evidently a traveller in many countries, and a close observer of men and
      things,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to see his poem,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to have seen that dog,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman said nothing; but he thought of Donna Christina, the stomach
      pump, and the fountain; and his eyes filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      A private sitting-room having been engaged, bedrooms inspected, and dinner
      ordered, the party walked out to view the city and adjoining
      neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not find, from a careful perusal of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s notes of the four
      towns, Stroud, Rochester, Chatham, and Brompton, that his impressions of
      their appearance differ in any material point from those of other
      travellers who have gone over the same ground. His general description is
      easily abridged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The principal productions of these towns,&rsquo; says Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;appear to
      be soldiers, sailors, Jews, chalk, shrimps, officers, and dockyard men.
      The commodities chiefly exposed for sale in the public streets are marine
      stores, hard-bake, apples, flat-fish, and oysters. The streets present a
      lively and animated appearance, occasioned chiefly by the conviviality of
      the military. It is truly delightful to a philanthropic mind to see these
      gallant men staggering along under the influence of an overflow both of
      animal and ardent spirits; more especially when we remember that the
      following them about, and jesting with them, affords a cheap and innocent
      amusement for the boy population. Nothing,&rsquo; adds Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;can exceed
      their good-humour. It was but the day before my arrival that one of them
      had been most grossly insulted in the house of a publican. The barmaid had
      positively refused to draw him any more liquor; in return for which he had
      (merely in playfulness) drawn his bayonet, and wounded the girl in the
      shoulder. And yet this fine fellow was the very first to go down to the
      house next morning and express his readiness to overlook the matter, and
      forget what had occurred!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The consumption of tobacco in these towns,&rsquo; continues Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;must
      be very great, and the smell which pervades the streets must be
      exceedingly delicious to those who are extremely fond of smoking. A
      superficial traveller might object to the dirt, which is their leading
      characteristic; but to those who view it as an indication of traffic and
      commercial prosperity, it is truly gratifying.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Punctual to five o&rsquo;clock came the stranger, and shortly afterwards the
      dinner. He had divested himself of his brown paper parcel, but had made no
      alteration in his attire, and was, if possible, more loquacious than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; he inquired, as the waiter removed one of the covers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Soles, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Soles&mdash;ah!&mdash;capital fish&mdash;all come from London-stage-coach
      proprietors get up political dinners&mdash;carriage of soles&mdash;dozens
      of baskets&mdash;cunning fellows. Glass of wine, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With pleasure,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; and the stranger took wine, first with
      him, and then with Mr. Snodgrass, and then with Mr. Tupman, and then with
      Mr. Winkle, and then with the whole party together, almost as rapidly as
      he talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Devil of a mess on the staircase, waiter,&rsquo; said the stranger. &lsquo;Forms
      going up&mdash;carpenters coming down&mdash;lamps, glasses, harps. What&rsquo;s
      going forward?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ball, Sir,&rsquo; said the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Assembly, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Sir, not assembly, Sir. Ball for the benefit of a charity, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Many fine women in this town, do you know, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Tupman,
      with great interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Splendid&mdash;capital. Kent, sir&mdash;everybody knows Kent&mdash;apples,
      cherries, hops, and women. Glass of wine, Sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With great pleasure,&rsquo; replied Mr. Tupman. The stranger filled, and
      emptied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should very much like to go,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, resuming the subject of
      the ball, &lsquo;very much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tickets at the bar, Sir,&rsquo; interposed the waiter; &lsquo;half-a-guinea each,
      Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman again expressed an earnest wish to be present at the festivity;
      but meeting with no response in the darkened eye of Mr. Snodgrass, or the
      abstracted gaze of Mr. Pickwick, he applied himself with great interest to
      the port wine and dessert, which had just been placed on the table. The
      waiter withdrew, and the party were left to enjoy the cosy couple of hours
      succeeding dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beg your pardon, sir,&rsquo; said the stranger, &lsquo;bottle stands&mdash;pass it
      round&mdash;way of the sun&mdash;through the button-hole&mdash;no
      heeltaps,&rsquo; and he emptied his glass, which he had filled about two minutes
      before, and poured out another, with the air of a man who was used to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wine was passed, and a fresh supply ordered. The visitor talked, the
      Pickwickians listened. Mr. Tupman felt every moment more disposed for the
      ball. Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s countenance glowed with an expression of universal
      philanthropy, and Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass fell fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re beginning upstairs,&rsquo; said the stranger&mdash;&lsquo;hear the company&mdash;fiddles
      tuning&mdash;now the harp&mdash;there they go.&rsquo; The various sounds which
      found their way downstairs announced the commencement of the first
      quadrille.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How I should like to go,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So should I,&rsquo; said the stranger&mdash;&lsquo;confounded luggage,&mdash;heavy
      smacks&mdash;nothing to go in&mdash;odd, ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;

      Now general benevolence was one of the leading features of the Pickwickian
      theory, and no one was more remarkable for the zealous manner in which he
      observed so noble a principle than Mr. Tracy Tupman. The number of
      instances recorded on the Transactions of the Society, in which that
      excellent man referred objects of charity to the houses of other members
      for left-off garments or pecuniary relief is almost incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be very happy to lend you a change of apparel for the purpose,&rsquo; 
      said Mr. Tracy Tupman, &lsquo;but you are rather slim, and I am&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather fat&mdash;grown-up Bacchus&mdash;cut the leaves&mdash;dismounted
      from the tub, and adopted kersey, eh?&mdash;not double distilled, but
      double milled&mdash;ha! ha! pass the wine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Mr. Tupman was somewhat indignant at the peremptory tone in which
      he was desired to pass the wine which the stranger passed so quickly away,
      or whether he felt very properly scandalised at an influential member of
      the Pickwick Club being ignominiously compared to a dismounted Bacchus, is
      a fact not yet completely ascertained. He passed the wine, coughed twice,
      and looked at the stranger for several seconds with a stern intensity; as
      that individual, however, appeared perfectly collected, and quite calm
      under his searching glance, he gradually relaxed, and reverted to the
      subject of the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was about to observe, Sir,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that though my apparel would be
      too large, a suit of my friend Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s would, perhaps, fit you
      better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger took Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s measure with his eye, and that feature
      glistened with satisfaction as he said, &lsquo;Just the thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman looked round him. The wine, which had exerted its somniferous
      influence over Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle, had stolen upon the senses of
      Mr. Pickwick. That gentleman had gradually passed through the various
      stages which precede the lethargy produced by dinner, and its
      consequences. He had undergone the ordinary transitions from the height of
      conviviality to the depth of misery, and from the depth of misery to the
      height of conviviality. Like a gas-lamp in the street, with the wind in
      the pipe, he had exhibited for a moment an unnatural brilliancy, then sank
      so low as to be scarcely discernible; after a short interval, he had burst
      out again, to enlighten for a moment; then flickered with an uncertain,
      staggering sort of light, and then gone out altogether. His head was sunk
      upon his bosom, and perpetual snoring, with a partial choke occasionally,
      were the only audible indications of the great man&rsquo;s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temptation to be present at the ball, and to form his first
      impressions of the beauty of the Kentish ladies, was strong upon Mr.
      Tupman. The temptation to take the stranger with him was equally great. He
      was wholly unacquainted with the place and its inhabitants, and the
      stranger seemed to possess as great a knowledge of both as if he had lived
      there from his infancy. Mr. Winkle was asleep, and Mr. Tupman had had
      sufficient experience in such matters to know that the moment he awoke he
      would, in the ordinary course of nature, roll heavily to bed. He was
      undecided. &lsquo;Fill your glass, and pass the wine,&rsquo; said the indefatigable
      visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman did as he was requested; and the additional stimulus of the
      last glass settled his determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Winkle&rsquo;s bedroom is inside mine,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman; &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t make him
      understand what I wanted, if I woke him now, but I know he has a
      dress-suit in a carpet bag; and supposing you wore it to the ball, and
      took it off when we returned, I could replace it without troubling him at
      all about the matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Capital,&rsquo; said the stranger, &lsquo;famous plan&mdash;damned odd situation&mdash;fourteen
      coats in the packing-cases, and obliged to wear another man&rsquo;s&mdash;very
      good notion, that&mdash;very.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must purchase our tickets,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not worth while splitting a guinea,&rsquo; said the stranger, &lsquo;toss who shall
      pay for both&mdash;I call; you spin&mdash;first time&mdash;woman&mdash;woman&mdash;bewitching
      woman,&rsquo; and down came the sovereign with the dragon (called by courtesy a
      woman) uppermost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman rang the bell, purchased the tickets, and ordered chamber
      candlesticks. In another quarter of an hour the stranger was completely
      arrayed in a full suit of Mr. Nathaniel Winkle&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a new coat,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, as the stranger surveyed himself with
      great complacency in a cheval glass; &lsquo;the first that&rsquo;s been made with our
      club button,&rsquo; and he called his companions&rsquo; attention to the large gilt
      button which displayed a bust of Mr. Pickwick in the centre, and the
      letters &lsquo;P. C.&rsquo; on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;P. C.&rdquo;&rsquo; said the stranger&mdash;&lsquo;queer set out&mdash;old fellow&rsquo;s
      likeness, and &ldquo;P. C.&rdquo;&mdash;What does &ldquo;P. C.&rdquo; stand for&mdash;Peculiar
      Coat, eh?&rsquo; Mr. Tupman, with rising indignation and great importance,
      explained the mystic device.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather short in the waist, ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; said the stranger, screwing himself
      round to catch a glimpse in the glass of the waist buttons, which were
      half-way up his back. &lsquo;Like a general postman&rsquo;s coat&mdash;queer coats
      those&mdash;made by contract&mdash;no measuring&mdash;mysterious
      dispensations of Providence&mdash;all the short men get long coats&mdash;all
      the long men short ones.&rsquo; Running on in this way, Mr. Tupman&rsquo;s new
      companion adjusted his dress, or rather the dress of Mr. Winkle; and,
      accompanied by Mr. Tupman, ascended the staircase leading to the ballroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What names, sir?&rsquo; said the man at the door. Mr. Tracy Tupman was stepping
      forward to announce his own titles, when the stranger prevented him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No names at all;&rsquo; and then he whispered Mr. Tupman, &lsquo;names won&rsquo;t do&mdash;not
      known&mdash;very good names in their way, but not great ones&mdash;capital
      names for a small party, but won&rsquo;t make an impression in public assemblies&mdash;incog.
      the thing&mdash;gentlemen from London&mdash;distinguished foreigners&mdash;anything.&rsquo; 
      The door was thrown open, and Mr. Tracy Tupman and the stranger entered
      the ballroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long room, with crimson-covered benches, and wax candles in glass
      chandeliers. The musicians were securely confined in an elevated den, and
      quadrilles were being systematically got through by two or three sets of
      dancers. Two card-tables were made up in the adjoining card-room, and two
      pair of old ladies, and a corresponding number of stout gentlemen, were
      executing whist therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      The finale concluded, the dancers promenaded the room, and Mr. Tupman and
      his companion stationed themselves in a corner to observe the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Charming women,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait a minute,&rsquo; said the stranger, &lsquo;fun presently&mdash;nobs not come yet&mdash;queer
      place&mdash;dockyard people of upper rank don&rsquo;t know dockyard people of
      lower rank&mdash;dockyard people of lower rank don&rsquo;t know small gentry&mdash;small
      gentry don&rsquo;t know tradespeople&mdash;commissioner don&rsquo;t know anybody.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that little boy with the light hair and pink eyes, in a fancy
      dress?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, pray&mdash;pink eyes&mdash;fancy dress&mdash;little boy&mdash;nonsense&mdash;ensign
      97th&mdash;Honourable Wilmot Snipe&mdash;great family&mdash;Snipes&mdash;very.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir Thomas Clubber, Lady Clubber, and the Misses Clubber!&rsquo; shouted the
      man at the door in a stentorian voice. A great sensation was created
      throughout the room by the entrance of a tall gentleman in a blue coat and
      bright buttons, a large lady in blue satin, and two young ladies, on a
      similar scale, in fashionably-made dresses of the same hue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Commissioner&mdash;head of the yard&mdash;great man&mdash;remarkably
      great man,&rsquo; whispered the stranger in Mr. Tupman&rsquo;s ear, as the charitable
      committee ushered Sir Thomas Clubber and family to the top of the room.
      The Honourable Wilmot Snipe, and other distinguished gentlemen crowded to
      render homage to the Misses Clubber; and Sir Thomas Clubber stood bolt
      upright, and looked majestically over his black kerchief at the assembled
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Smithie, Mrs. Smithie, and the Misses Smithie,&rsquo; was the next
      announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s Mr. Smithie?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Tracy Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something in the yard,&rsquo; replied the stranger. Mr. Smithie bowed
      deferentially to Sir Thomas Clubber; and Sir Thomas Clubber acknowledged
      the salute with conscious condescension. Lady Clubber took a telescopic
      view of Mrs. Smithie and family through her eye-glass and Mrs. Smithie
      stared in her turn at Mrs. Somebody-else, whose husband was not in the
      dockyard at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Colonel Bulder, Mrs. Colonel Bulder, and Miss Bulder,&rsquo; were the next
      arrivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Head of the garrison,&rsquo; said the stranger, in reply to Mr. Tupman&rsquo;s
      inquiring look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bulder was warmly welcomed by the Misses Clubber; the greeting
      between Mrs. Colonel Bulder and Lady Clubber was of the most affectionate
      description; Colonel Bulder and Sir Thomas Clubber exchanged snuff-boxes,
      and looked very much like a pair of Alexander Selkirks&mdash;&lsquo;Monarchs of
      all they surveyed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While the aristocracy of the place&mdash;the Bulders, and Clubbers, and
      Snipes&mdash;were thus preserving their dignity at the upper end of the
      room, the other classes of society were imitating their example in other
      parts of it. The less aristocratic officers of the 97th devoted themselves
      to the families of the less important functionaries from the dockyard. The
      solicitors&rsquo; wives, and the wine-merchant&rsquo;s wife, headed another grade (the
      brewer&rsquo;s wife visited the Bulders); and Mrs. Tomlinson, the post-office
      keeper, seemed by mutual consent to have been chosen the leader of the
      trade party.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most popular personages, in his own circle, present, was a
      little fat man, with a ring of upright black hair round his head, and an
      extensive bald plain on the top of it&mdash;Doctor Slammer, surgeon to the
      97th. The doctor took snuff with everybody, chatted with everybody,
      laughed, danced, made jokes, played whist, did everything, and was
      everywhere. To these pursuits, multifarious as they were, the little
      doctor added a more important one than any&mdash;he was indefatigable in
      paying the most unremitting and devoted attention to a little old widow,
      whose rich dress and profusion of ornament bespoke her a most desirable
      addition to a limited income.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the doctor, and the widow, the eyes of both Mr. Tupman and his
      companion had been fixed for some time, when the stranger broke silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lots of money&mdash;old girl&mdash;pompous doctor&mdash;not a bad idea&mdash;good
      fun,&rsquo; were the intelligible sentences which issued from his lips. Mr.
      Tupman looked inquisitively in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll dance with the widow,&rsquo; said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is she?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know&mdash;never saw her in all my life&mdash;cut out the doctor&mdash;here
      goes.&rsquo; And the stranger forthwith crossed the room; and, leaning against a
      mantel-piece, commenced gazing with an air of respectful and melancholy
      admiration on the fat countenance of the little old lady. Mr. Tupman
      looked on, in mute astonishment. The stranger progressed rapidly; the
      little doctor danced with another lady; the widow dropped her fan; the
      stranger picked it up, and presented it&mdash;a smile&mdash;a bow&mdash;a
      curtsey&mdash;a few words of conversation. The stranger walked boldly up
      to, and returned with, the master of the ceremonies; a little introductory
      pantomime; and the stranger and Mrs. Budger took their places in a
      quadrille.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surprise of Mr. Tupman at this summary proceeding, great as it was,
      was immeasurably exceeded by the astonishment of the doctor. The stranger
      was young, and the widow was flattered. The doctor&rsquo;s attentions were
      unheeded by the widow; and the doctor&rsquo;s indignation was wholly lost on his
      imperturbable rival. Doctor Slammer was paralysed. He, Doctor Slammer, of
      the 97th, to be extinguished in a moment, by a man whom nobody had ever
      seen before, and whom nobody knew even now! Doctor Slammer&mdash;Doctor
      Slammer of the 97th rejected! Impossible! It could not be! Yes, it was;
      there they were. What! introducing his friend! Could he believe his eyes!
      He looked again, and was under the painful necessity of admitting the
      veracity of his optics; Mrs. Budger was dancing with Mr. Tracy Tupman;
      there was no mistaking the fact. There was the widow before him, bouncing
      bodily here and there, with unwonted vigour; and Mr. Tracy Tupman hopping
      about, with a face expressive of the most intense solemnity, dancing (as a
      good many people do) as if a quadrille were not a thing to be laughed at,
      but a severe trial to the feelings, which it requires inflexible
      resolution to encounter.
    </p>

      <a href="images/0066.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Silently and patiently did the doctor bear all this, and all the handings
      of negus, and watching for glasses, and darting for biscuits, and
      coquetting, that ensued; but, a few seconds after the stranger had
      disappeared to lead Mrs. Budger to her carriage, he darted swiftly from
      the room with every particle of his hitherto-bottled-up indignation
      effervescing, from all parts of his countenance, in a perspiration of
      passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger was returning, and Mr. Tupman was beside him. He spoke in a
      low tone, and laughed. The little doctor thirsted for his life. He was
      exulting. He had triumphed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir!&rsquo; said the doctor, in an awful voice, producing a card, and retiring
      into an angle of the passage, &lsquo;my name is Slammer, Doctor Slammer, sir&mdash;97th
      Regiment&mdash;Chatham Barracks&mdash;my card, Sir, my card.&rsquo; He would
      have added more, but his indignation choked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; replied the stranger coolly, &lsquo;Slammer&mdash;much obliged&mdash;polite
      attention&mdash;not ill now, Slammer&mdash;but when I am&mdash;knock you
      up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;re a shuffler, sir,&rsquo; gasped the furious doctor, &lsquo;a poltroon&mdash;a
      coward&mdash;a liar&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;will nothing induce you to give
      me your card, sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I see,&rsquo; said the stranger, half aside, &lsquo;negus too strong here&mdash;liberal
      landlord&mdash;very foolish&mdash;very&mdash;lemonade much better&mdash;hot
      rooms&mdash;elderly gentlemen&mdash;suffer for it in the morning&mdash;cruel&mdash;cruel;&rsquo; 
      and he moved on a step or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are stopping in this house, Sir,&rsquo; said the indignant little man; &lsquo;you
      are intoxicated now, Sir; you shall hear from me in the morning, sir. I
      shall find you out, sir; I shall find you out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather you found me out than found me at home,&rsquo; replied the unmoved
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Slammer looked unutterable ferocity, as he fixed his hat on his
      head with an indignant knock; and the stranger and Mr. Tupman ascended to
      the bedroom of the latter to restore the borrowed plumage to the
      unconscious Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      That gentleman was fast asleep; the restoration was soon made. The
      stranger was extremely jocose; and Mr. Tracy Tupman, being quite
      bewildered with wine, negus, lights, and ladies, thought the whole affair
      was an exquisite joke. His new friend departed; and, after experiencing
      some slight difficulty in finding the orifice in his nightcap, originally
      intended for the reception of his head, and finally overturning his
      candlestick in his struggles to put it on, Mr. Tracy Tupman managed to get
      into bed by a series of complicated evolutions, and shortly afterwards
      sank into repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven o&rsquo;clock had hardly ceased striking on the following morning, when
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s comprehensive mind was aroused from the state of
      unconsciousness, in which slumber had plunged it, by a loud knocking at
      his chamber door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, starting up in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Boots, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please, sir, can you tell me which gentleman of your party wears a bright
      blue dress-coat, with a gilt button with &ldquo;P. C.&rdquo; on it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s been given out to brush,&rsquo; thought Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;and the man has
      forgotten whom it belongs to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle,&rsquo; he called out, &lsquo;next room but two, on the right hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, sir,&rsquo; said the Boots, and away he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; cried Mr. Tupman, as a loud knocking at his door
      roused him from his oblivious repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can I speak to Mr. Winkle, sir?&rsquo; replied Boots from the outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Winkle&mdash;Winkle!&rsquo; shouted Mr. Tupman, calling into the inner room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo!&rsquo; replied a faint voice from within the bed-clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re wanted&mdash;some one at the door;&rsquo; and, having exerted himself to
      articulate thus much, Mr. Tracy Tupman turned round and fell fast asleep
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wanted!&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, hastily jumping out of bed, and putting on a
      few articles of clothing; &lsquo;wanted! at this distance from town&mdash;who on
      earth can want me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentleman in the coffee-room, sir,&rsquo; replied the Boots, as Mr. Winkle
      opened the door and confronted him; &lsquo;gentleman says he&rsquo;ll not detain you a
      moment, Sir, but he can take no denial.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very odd!&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be down directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurriedly wrapped himself in a travelling-shawl and dressing-gown, and
      proceeded downstairs. An old woman and a couple of waiters were cleaning
      the coffee-room, and an officer in undress uniform was looking out of the
      window. He turned round as Mr. Winkle entered, and made a stiff
      inclination of the head. Having ordered the attendants to retire, and
      closed the door very carefully, he said, &lsquo;Mr. Winkle, I presume?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name is Winkle, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will not be surprised, sir, when I inform you that I have called here
      this morning on behalf of my friend, Doctor Slammer, of the 97th.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Doctor Slammer!&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Doctor Slammer. He begged me to express his opinion that your conduct of
      last evening was of a description which no gentleman could endure; and&rsquo; 
      (he added) &lsquo;which no one gentleman would pursue towards another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s astonishment was too real, and too evident, to escape the
      observation of Doctor Slammer&rsquo;s friend; he therefore proceeded&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friend, Doctor Slammer, requested me to add, that he was firmly
      persuaded you were intoxicated during a portion of the evening, and
      possibly unconscious of the extent of the insult you were guilty of. He
      commissioned me to say, that should this be pleaded as an excuse for your
      behaviour, he will consent to accept a written apology, to be penned by
      you, from my dictation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A written apology!&rsquo; repeated Mr. Winkle, in the most emphatic tone of
      amazement possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you know the alternative,&rsquo; replied the visitor coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Were you intrusted with this message to me by name?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Winkle,
      whose intellects were hopelessly confused by this extraordinary
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was not present myself,&rsquo; replied the visitor, &lsquo;and in consequence of
      your firm refusal to give your card to Doctor Slammer, I was desired by
      that gentleman to identify the wearer of a very uncommon coat&mdash;a
      bright blue dress-coat, with a gilt button displaying a bust, and the
      letters &ldquo;P. C.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle actually staggered with astonishment as he heard his own
      costume thus minutely described. Doctor Slammer&rsquo;s friend proceeded:&mdash;&lsquo;From
      the inquiries I made at the bar, just now, I was convinced that the owner
      of the coat in question arrived here, with three gentlemen, yesterday
      afternoon. I immediately sent up to the gentleman who was described as
      appearing the head of the party, and he at once referred me to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      If the principal tower of Rochester Castle had suddenly walked from its
      foundation, and stationed itself opposite the coffee-room window, Mr.
      Winkle&rsquo;s surprise would have been as nothing compared with the profound
      astonishment with which he had heard this address. His first impression
      was that his coat had been stolen. &lsquo;Will you allow me to detain you one
      moment?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; replied the unwelcome visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle ran hastily upstairs, and with a trembling hand opened the bag.
      There was the coat in its usual place, but exhibiting, on a close
      inspection, evident tokens of having been worn on the preceding night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must be so,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, letting the coat fall from his hands. &lsquo;I
      took too much wine after dinner, and have a very vague recollection of
      walking about the streets, and smoking a cigar afterwards. The fact is, I
      was very drunk;&mdash;I must have changed my coat&mdash;gone somewhere&mdash;and
      insulted somebody&mdash;I have no doubt of it; and this message is the
      terrible consequence.&rsquo; Saying which, Mr. Winkle retraced his steps in the
      direction of the coffee-room, with the gloomy and dreadful resolve of
      accepting the challenge of the warlike Doctor Slammer, and abiding by the
      worst consequences that might ensue.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this determination Mr. Winkle was urged by a variety of considerations,
      the first of which was his reputation with the club. He had always been
      looked up to as a high authority on all matters of amusement and
      dexterity, whether offensive, defensive, or inoffensive; and if, on this
      very first occasion of being put to the test, he shrunk back from the
      trial, beneath his leader&rsquo;s eye, his name and standing were lost for ever.
      Besides, he remembered to have heard it frequently surmised by the
      uninitiated in such matters that by an understood arrangement between the
      seconds, the pistols were seldom loaded with ball; and, furthermore, he
      reflected that if he applied to Mr. Snodgrass to act as his second, and
      depicted the danger in glowing terms, that gentleman might possibly
      communicate the intelligence to Mr. Pickwick, who would certainly lose no
      time in transmitting it to the local authorities, and thus prevent the
      killing or maiming of his follower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were his thoughts when he returned to the coffee-room, and intimated
      his intention of accepting the doctor&rsquo;s challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you refer me to a friend, to arrange the time and place of meeting?&rsquo; 
      said the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite unnecessary,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle; &lsquo;name them to me, and I can
      procure the attendance of a friend afterwards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall we say&mdash;sunset this evening?&rsquo; inquired the officer, in a
      careless tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle, thinking in his heart it was very bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know Fort Pitt?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; I saw it yesterday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you will take the trouble to turn into the field which borders the
      trench, take the foot-path to the left when you arrive at an angle of the
      fortification, and keep straight on, till you see me, I will precede you
      to a secluded place, where the affair can be conducted without fear of
      interruption.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fear of interruption!&rsquo; thought Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing more to arrange, I think,&rsquo; said the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not aware of anything more,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle. &lsquo;Good-morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-morning;&rsquo; and the officer whistled a lively air as he strode away.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning&rsquo;s breakfast passed heavily off. Mr. Tupman was not in a
      condition to rise, after the unwonted dissipation of the previous night;
      Mr. Snodgrass appeared to labour under a poetical depression of spirits;
      and even Mr. Pickwick evinced an unusual attachment to silence and
      soda-water. Mr. Winkle eagerly watched his opportunity: it was not long
      wanting. Mr. Snodgrass proposed a visit to the castle, and as Mr. Winkle
      was the only other member of the party disposed to walk, they went out
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Snodgrass,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, when they had turned out of the public
      street.&lsquo;Snodgrass, my dear fellow, can I rely upon your secrecy?&rsquo; As he
      said this, he most devoutly and earnestly hoped he could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can,&rsquo; replied Mr. Snodgrass. &lsquo;Hear me swear&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; interrupted Winkle, terrified at the idea of his companion&rsquo;s
      unconsciously pledging himself not to give information; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t swear,
      don&rsquo;t swear; it&rsquo;s quite unnecessary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Snodgrass dropped the hand which he had, in the spirit of poesy,
      raised towards the clouds as he made the above appeal, and assumed an
      attitude of attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want your assistance, my dear fellow, in an affair of honour,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall have it,&rsquo; replied Mr. Snodgrass, clasping his friend&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With a doctor&mdash;Doctor Slammer, of the 97th,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle,
      wishing to make the matter appear as solemn as possible; &lsquo;an affair with
      an officer, seconded by another officer, at sunset this evening, in a
      lonely field beyond Fort Pitt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will attend you,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was astonished, but by no means dismayed. It is extraordinary how cool
      any party but the principal can be in such cases. Mr. Winkle had forgotten
      this. He had judged of his friend&rsquo;s feelings by his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The consequences may be dreadful,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope not,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The doctor, I believe, is a very good shot,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most of these military men are,&rsquo; observed Mr. Snodgrass calmly; &lsquo;but so
      are you, ain&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle replied in the affirmative; and perceiving that he had not
      alarmed his companion sufficiently, changed his ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Snodgrass,&rsquo; he said, in a voice tremulous with emotion, &lsquo;if I fall, you
      will find in a packet which I shall place in your hands a note for my&mdash;for
      my father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This attack was a failure also. Mr. Snodgrass was affected, but he
      undertook the delivery of the note as readily as if he had been a twopenny
      postman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I fall,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, &lsquo;or if the doctor falls, you, my dear
      friend, will be tried as an accessory before the fact. Shall I involve my
      friend in transportation&mdash;possibly for life!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Snodgrass winced a little at this, but his heroism was invincible. &lsquo;In
      the cause of friendship,&rsquo; he fervently exclaimed, &lsquo;I would brave all
      dangers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      How Mr. Winkle cursed his companion&rsquo;s devoted friendship internally, as
      they walked silently along, side by side, for some minutes, each immersed
      in his own meditations! The morning was wearing away; he grew desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Snodgrass,&rsquo; he said, stopping suddenly, &lsquo;do not let me be balked in this
      matter&mdash;do not give information to the local authorities&mdash;do not
      obtain the assistance of several peace officers, to take either me or
      Doctor Slammer, of the 97th Regiment, at present quartered in Chatham
      Barracks, into custody, and thus prevent this duel!&mdash;I say, do not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Snodgrass seized his friend&rsquo;s hand warmly, as he enthusiastically
      replied, &lsquo;Not for worlds!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A thrill passed over Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s frame as the conviction that he had
      nothing to hope from his friend&rsquo;s fears, and that he was destined to
      become an animated target, rushed forcibly upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of the case having been formally explained to Mr. Snodgrass, and
      a case of satisfactory pistols, with the satisfactory accompaniments of
      powder, ball, and caps, having been hired from a manufacturer in
      Rochester, the two friends returned to their inn; Mr. Winkle to ruminate
      on the approaching struggle, and Mr. Snodgrass to arrange the weapons of
      war, and put them into proper order for immediate use.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a dull and heavy evening when they again sallied forth on their
      awkward errand. Mr. Winkle was muffled up in a huge cloak to escape
      observation, and Mr. Snodgrass bore under his the instruments of
      destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you got everything?&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, in an agitated tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everything,&rsquo; replied Mr. Snodgrass; &lsquo;plenty of ammunition, in case the
      shots don&rsquo;t take effect. There&rsquo;s a quarter of a pound of powder in the
      case, and I have got two newspapers in my pocket for the loadings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These were instances of friendship for which any man might reasonably feel
      most grateful. The presumption is, that the gratitude of Mr. Winkle was
      too powerful for utterance, as he said nothing, but continued to walk on&mdash;rather
      slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are in excellent time,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass, as they climbed the fence
      of the first field; &lsquo;the sun is just going down.&rsquo; Mr. Winkle looked up at
      the declining orb and painfully thought of the probability of his &lsquo;going
      down&rsquo; himself, before long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the officer,&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Winkle, after a few minutes walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where?&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&mdash;the gentleman in the blue cloak.&rsquo; Mr. Snodgrass looked in the
      direction indicated by the forefinger of his friend, and observed a
      figure, muffled up, as he had described. The officer evinced his
      consciousness of their presence by slightly beckoning with his hand; and
      the two friends followed him at a little distance, as he walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening grew more dull every moment, and a melancholy wind sounded
      through the deserted fields, like a distant giant whistling for his
      house-dog. The sadness of the scene imparted a sombre tinge to the
      feelings of Mr. Winkle. He started as they passed the angle of the trench&mdash;it
      looked like a colossal grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer turned suddenly from the path, and after climbing a paling,
      and scaling a hedge, entered a secluded field. Two gentlemen were waiting
      in it; one was a little, fat man, with black hair; and the other&mdash;a
      portly personage in a braided surtout&mdash;was sitting with perfect
      equanimity on a camp-stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The other party, and a surgeon, I suppose,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass; &lsquo;take a
      drop of brandy.&rsquo; Mr. Winkle seized the wicker bottle which his friend
      proffered, and took a lengthened pull at the exhilarating liquid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friend, Sir, Mr. Snodgrass,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, as the officer
      approached. Doctor Slammer&rsquo;s friend bowed, and produced a case similar to
      that which Mr. Snodgrass carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have nothing further to say, Sir, I think,&rsquo; he coldly remarked, as he
      opened the case; &lsquo;an apology has been resolutely declined.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass, who began to feel rather uncomfortable
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you step forward?&rsquo; said the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; replied Mr. Snodgrass. The ground was measured, and
      preliminaries arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will find these better than your own,&rsquo; said the opposite second,
      producing his pistols. &lsquo;You saw me load them. Do you object to use them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Snodgrass. The offer relieved him from
      considerable embarrassment, for his previous notions of loading a pistol
      were rather vague and undefined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We may place our men, then, I think,&rsquo; observed the officer, with as much
      indifference as if the principals were chess-men, and the seconds players.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think we may,&rsquo; replied Mr. Snodgrass; who would have assented to any
      proposition, because he knew nothing about the matter. The officer crossed
      to Doctor Slammer, and Mr. Snodgrass went up to Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all ready,&rsquo; said he, offering the pistol. &lsquo;Give me your cloak.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have got the packet, my dear fellow,&rsquo; said poor Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass. &lsquo;Be steady, and wing him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to Mr. Winkle that this advice was very like that which
      bystanders invariably give to the smallest boy in a street fight, namely,
      &lsquo;Go in, and win&rsquo;&mdash;an admirable thing to recommend, if you only know
      how to do it. He took off his cloak, however, in silence&mdash;it always
      took a long time to undo that cloak&mdash;and accepted the pistol. The
      seconds retired, the gentleman on the camp-stool did the same, and the
      belligerents approached each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle was always remarkable for extreme humanity. It is conjectured
      that his unwillingness to hurt a fellow-creature intentionally was the
      cause of his shutting his eyes when he arrived at the fatal spot; and that
      the circumstance of his eyes being closed, prevented his observing the
      very extraordinary and unaccountable demeanour of Doctor Slammer. That
      gentleman started, stared, retreated, rubbed his eyes, stared again, and,
      finally, shouted, &lsquo;Stop, stop!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rsquo; said Doctor Slammer, as his friend and Mr. Snodgrass
      came running up; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s not the man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not the man!&rsquo; said Doctor Slammer&rsquo;s second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not the man!&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not the man!&rsquo; said the gentleman with the camp-stool in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; replied the little doctor. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not the person who
      insulted me last night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very extraordinary!&rsquo; exclaimed the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very,&rsquo; said the gentleman with the camp-stool. &lsquo;The only question is,
      whether the gentleman, being on the ground, must not be considered, as a
      matter of form, to be the individual who insulted our friend, Doctor
      Slammer, yesterday evening, whether he is really that individual or not;&rsquo; 
      and having delivered this suggestion, with a very sage and mysterious air,
      the man with the camp-stool took a large pinch of snuff, and looked
      profoundly round, with the air of an authority in such matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Mr. Winkle had opened his eyes, and his ears too, when he heard his
      adversary call out for a cessation of hostilities; and perceiving by what
      he had afterwards said that there was, beyond all question, some mistake
      in the matter, he at once foresaw the increase of reputation he should
      inevitably acquire by concealing the real motive of his coming out; he
      therefore stepped boldly forward, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not the person. I know it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, that,&rsquo; said the man with the camp-stool, &lsquo;is an affront to Doctor
      Slammer, and a sufficient reason for proceeding immediately.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray be quiet, Payne,&rsquo; said the doctor&rsquo;s second. &lsquo;Why did you not
      communicate this fact to me this morning, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure&mdash;to be sure,&rsquo; said the man with the camp-stool
      indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I entreat you to be quiet, Payne,&rsquo; said the other. &lsquo;May I repeat my
      question, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle, who had had time to deliberate upon
      his answer, &lsquo;because, Sir, you described an intoxicated and ungentlemanly
      person as wearing a coat which I have the honour, not only to wear but to
      have invented&mdash;the proposed uniform, Sir, of the Pickwick Club in
      London. The honour of that uniform I feel bound to maintain, and I
      therefore, without inquiry, accepted the challenge which you offered me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Sir,&rsquo; said the good-humoured little doctor advancing with
      extended hand, &lsquo;I honour your gallantry. Permit me to say, Sir, that I
      highly admire your conduct, and extremely regret having caused you the
      inconvenience of this meeting, to no purpose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg you won&rsquo;t mention it, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall feel proud of your acquaintance, Sir,&rsquo; said the little doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will afford me the greatest pleasure to know you, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Winkle. Thereupon the doctor and Mr. Winkle shook hands, and then Mr.
      Winkle and Lieutenant Tappleton (the doctor&rsquo;s second), and then Mr. Winkle
      and the man with the camp-stool, and, finally, Mr. Winkle and Mr.
      Snodgrass&mdash;the last-named gentleman in an excess of admiration at the
      noble conduct of his heroic friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think we may adjourn,&rsquo; said Lieutenant Tappleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; added the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unless,&rsquo; interposed the man with the camp-stool, &lsquo;unless Mr. Winkle feels
      himself aggrieved by the challenge; in which case, I submit, he has a
      right to satisfaction.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle, with great self-denial, expressed himself quite satisfied
      already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or possibly,&rsquo; said the man with the camp-stool, &lsquo;the gentleman&rsquo;s second
      may feel himself affronted with some observations which fell from me at an
      early period of this meeting; if so, I shall be happy to give him
      satisfaction immediately.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Snodgrass hastily professed himself very much obliged with the
      handsome offer of the gentleman who had spoken last, which he was only
      induced to decline by his entire contentment with the whole proceedings.
      The two seconds adjusted the cases, and the whole party left the ground in
      a much more lively manner than they had proceeded to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you remain long here?&rsquo; inquired Doctor Slammer of Mr. Winkle, as they
      walked on most amicably together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think we shall leave here the day after to-morrow,&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I trust I shall have the pleasure of seeing you and your friend at my
      rooms, and of spending a pleasant evening with you, after this awkward
      mistake,&rsquo; said the little doctor; &lsquo;are you disengaged this evening?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have some friends here,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle, &lsquo;and I should not like to
      leave them to-night. Perhaps you and your friend will join us at the
      Bull.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With great pleasure,&rsquo; said the little doctor; &lsquo;will ten o&rsquo;clock be too
      late to look in for half an hour?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear, no,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle. &lsquo;I shall be most happy to introduce you to
      my friends, Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will give me great pleasure, I am sure,&rsquo; replied Doctor Slammer,
      little suspecting who Mr. Tupman was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will be sure to come?&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, certainly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had reached the road. Cordial farewells were exchanged,
      and the party separated. Doctor Slammer and his friends repaired to the
      barracks, and Mr. Winkle, accompanied by Mr. Snodgrass, returned to their
      inn.

      CHAPTER III. A NEW ACQUAINTANCE&mdash;THE STROLLER&rsquo;S TALE&mdash;A
      DISAGREEABLE INTERRUPTION, AND AN UNPLEASANT ENCOUNTER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Pickwick had
      felt some apprehensions in consequence of the unusual absence of his two
      friends, which their mysterious behaviour during the whole morning had by
      no means tended to diminish. It was, therefore, with more than ordinary
      pleasure that he rose to greet them when they again entered; and with more
      than ordinary interest that he inquired what had occurred to detain them
      from his society. In reply to his questions on this point, Mr. Snodgrass
      was about to offer an historical account of the circumstances just now
      detailed, when he was suddenly checked by observing that there were
      present, not only Mr. Tupman and their stage-coach companion of the
      preceding day, but another stranger of equally singular appearance. It was
      a careworn-looking man, whose sallow face, and deeply-sunken eyes, were
      rendered still more striking than Nature had made them, by the straight
      black hair which hung in matted disorder half-way down his face. His eyes
      were almost unnaturally bright and piercing; his cheek-bones were high and
      prominent; and his jaws were so long and lank, that an observer would have
      supposed that he was drawing the flesh of his face in, for a moment, by
      some contraction of the muscles, if his half-opened mouth and immovable
      expression had not announced that it was his ordinary appearance. Round
      his neck he wore a green shawl, with the large ends straggling over his
      chest, and making their appearance occasionally beneath the worn
      button-holes of his old waistcoat. His upper garment was a long black
      surtout; and below it he wore wide drab trousers, and large boots, running
      rapidly to seed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on this uncouth-looking person that Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s eye rested, and it
      was towards him that Mr. Pickwick extended his hand when he said, &lsquo;A
      friend of our friend&rsquo;s here. We discovered this morning that our friend
      was connected with the theatre in this place, though he is not desirous to
      have it generally known, and this gentleman is a member of the same
      profession. He was about to favour us with a little anecdote connected
      with it, when you entered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lots of anecdote,&rsquo; said the green-coated stranger of the day before,
      advancing to Mr. Winkle and speaking in a low and confidential tone. &lsquo;Rum
      fellow&mdash;does the heavy business&mdash;no actor&mdash;strange man&mdash;all
      sorts of miseries&mdash;Dismal Jemmy, we call him on the circuit.&rsquo; Mr.
      Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass politely welcomed the gentleman, elegantly
      designated as &lsquo;Dismal Jemmy&rsquo;; and calling for brandy-and-water, in
      imitation of the remainder of the company, seated themselves at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;will you oblige us by proceeding with what
      you were going to relate?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dismal individual took a dirty roll of paper from his pocket, and
      turning to Mr. Snodgrass, who had just taken out his note-book, said in a
      hollow voice, perfectly in keeping with his outward man&mdash;&lsquo;Are you the
      poet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;I do a little in that way,&rsquo; replied Mr. Snodgrass, rather taken
      aback by the abruptness of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! poetry makes life what light and music do the stage&mdash;strip the
      one of the false embellishments, and the other of its illusions, and what
      is there real in either to live or care for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very true, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be before the footlights,&rsquo; continued the dismal man, &lsquo;is like sitting
      at a grand court show, and admiring the silken dresses of the gaudy
      throng; to be behind them is to be the people who make that finery,
      uncared for and unknown, and left to sink or swim, to starve or live, as
      fortune wills it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass: for the sunken eye of the dismal man
      rested on him, and he felt it necessary to say something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go on, Jemmy,&rsquo; said the Spanish traveller, &lsquo;like black-eyed Susan&mdash;all
      in the Downs&mdash;no croaking&mdash;speak out&mdash;look lively.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you make another glass before you begin, Sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dismal man took the hint, and having mixed a glass of
      brandy-and-water, and slowly swallowed half of it, opened the roll of
      paper and proceeded, partly to read, and partly to relate, the following
      incident, which we find recorded on the Transactions of the Club as &lsquo;The
      Stroller&rsquo;s Tale.&rsquo; 
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  THE STROLLER&rsquo;S TALE
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is nothing of the marvellous in what I am going to relate,&rsquo; said
      the dismal man; &lsquo;there is nothing even uncommon in it. Want and sickness
      are too common in many stations of life to deserve more notice than is
      usually bestowed on the most ordinary vicissitudes of human nature. I have
      thrown these few notes together, because the subject of them was well
      known to me for many years. I traced his progress downwards, step by step,
      until at last he reached that excess of destitution from which he never
      rose again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man of whom I speak was a low pantomime actor; and, like many people
      of his class, an habitual drunkard. In his better days, before he had
      become enfeebled by dissipation and emaciated by disease, he had been in
      the receipt of a good salary, which, if he had been careful and prudent,
      he might have continued to receive for some years&mdash;not many; because
      these men either die early, or by unnaturally taxing their bodily
      energies, lose, prematurely, those physical powers on which alone they can
      depend for subsistence. His besetting sin gained so fast upon him,
      however, that it was found impossible to employ him in the situations in
      which he really was useful to the theatre. The public-house had a
      fascination for him which he could not resist. Neglected disease and
      hopeless poverty were as certain to be his portion as death itself, if he
      persevered in the same course; yet he did persevere, and the result may be
      guessed. He could obtain no engagement, and he wanted bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everybody who is at all acquainted with theatrical matters knows what a
      host of shabby, poverty-stricken men hang about the stage of a large
      establishment&mdash;not regularly engaged actors, but ballet people,
      procession men, tumblers, and so forth, who are taken on during the run of
      a pantomime, or an Easter piece, and are then discharged, until the
      production of some heavy spectacle occasions a new demand for their
      services. To this mode of life the man was compelled to resort; and taking
      the chair every night, at some low theatrical house, at once put him in
      possession of a few more shillings weekly, and enabled him to gratify his
      old propensity. Even this resource shortly failed him; his irregularities
      were too great to admit of his earning the wretched pittance he might thus
      have procured, and he was actually reduced to a state bordering on
      starvation, only procuring a trifle occasionally by borrowing it of some
      old companion, or by obtaining an appearance at one or other of the
      commonest of the minor theatres; and when he did earn anything it was
      spent in the old way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About this time, and when he had been existing for upwards of a year no
      one knew how, I had a short engagement at one of the theatres on the
      Surrey side of the water, and here I saw this man, whom I had lost sight
      of for some time; for I had been travelling in the provinces, and he had
      been skulking in the lanes and alleys of London. I was dressed to leave
      the house, and was crossing the stage on my way out, when he tapped me on
      the shoulder. Never shall I forget the repulsive sight that met my eye
      when I turned round. He was dressed for the pantomimes in all the
      absurdity of a clown&rsquo;s costume. The spectral figures in the Dance of
      Death, the most frightful shapes that the ablest painter ever portrayed on
      canvas, never presented an appearance half so ghastly. His bloated body
      and shrunken legs&mdash;their deformity enhanced a hundredfold by the
      fantastic dress&mdash;the glassy eyes, contrasting fearfully with the
      thick white paint with which the face was besmeared; the
      grotesquely-ornamented head, trembling with paralysis, and the long skinny
      hands, rubbed with white chalk&mdash;all gave him a hideous and unnatural
      appearance, of which no description could convey an adequate idea, and
      which, to this day, I shudder to think of. His voice was hollow and
      tremulous as he took me aside, and in broken words recounted a long
      catalogue of sickness and privations, terminating as usual with an urgent
      request for the loan of a trifling sum of money. I put a few shillings in
      his hand, and as I turned away I heard the roar of laughter which followed
      his first tumble on the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A few nights afterwards, a boy put a dirty scrap of paper in my hand, on
      which were scrawled a few words in pencil, intimating that the man was
      dangerously ill, and begging me, after the performance, to see him at his
      lodgings in some street&mdash;I forget the name of it now&mdash;at no
      great distance from the theatre. I promised to comply, as soon as I could
      get away; and after the curtain fell, sallied forth on my melancholy
      errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was late, for I had been playing in the last piece; and, as it was a
      benefit night, the performances had been protracted to an unusual length.
      It was a dark, cold night, with a chill, damp wind, which blew the rain
      heavily against the windows and house-fronts. Pools of water had collected
      in the narrow and little-frequented streets, and as many of the
      thinly-scattered oil-lamps had been blown out by the violence of the wind,
      the walk was not only a comfortless, but most uncertain one. I had
      fortunately taken the right course, however, and succeeded, after a little
      difficulty, in finding the house to which I had been directed&mdash;a
      coal-shed, with one storey above it, in the back room of which lay the
      object of my search.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A wretched-looking woman, the man&rsquo;s wife, met me on the stairs, and,
      telling me that he had just fallen into a kind of doze, led me softly in,
      and placed a chair for me at the bedside. The sick man was lying with his
      face turned towards the wall; and as he took no heed of my presence, I had
      leisure to observe the place in which I found myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was lying on an old bedstead, which turned up during the day. The
      tattered remains of a checked curtain were drawn round the bed&rsquo;s head, to
      exclude the wind, which, however, made its way into the comfortless room
      through the numerous chinks in the door, and blew it to and fro every
      instant. There was a low cinder fire in a rusty, unfixed grate; and an old
      three-cornered stained table, with some medicine bottles, a broken glass,
      and a few other domestic articles, was drawn out before it. A little child
      was sleeping on a temporary bed which had been made for it on the floor,
      and the woman sat on a chair by its side. There were a couple of shelves,
      with a few plates and cups and saucers; and a pair of stage shoes and a
      couple of foils hung beneath them. With the exception of little heaps of
      rags and bundles which had been carelessly thrown into the corners of the
      room, these were the only things in the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had had time to note these little particulars, and to mark the heavy
      breathing and feverish startings of the sick man, before he was aware of
      my presence. In the restless attempts to procure some easy resting-place
      for his head, he tossed his hand out of the bed, and it fell on mine. He
      started up, and stared eagerly in my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Mr. Hutley, John,&rdquo; said his wife; &ldquo;Mr. Hutley, that you sent for
      to-night, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the invalid, passing his hand across his forehead; &ldquo;Hutley&mdash;Hutley&mdash;let
      me see.&rdquo; He seemed endeavouring to collect his thoughts for a few seconds,
      and then grasping me tightly by the wrist said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      leave me, old fellow. She&rsquo;ll murder me; I know she will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/0084m.jpg" alt="0084m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0084.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Has he been long so?&rdquo; said I, addressing his weeping wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Since yesterday night,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;John, John, don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let her come near me,&rdquo; said the man, with a shudder, as she
      stooped over him. &ldquo;Drive her away; I can&rsquo;t bear her near me.&rdquo; He stared
      wildly at her, with a look of deadly apprehension, and then whispered in
      my ear, &ldquo;I beat her, Jem; I beat her yesterday, and many times before. I
      have starved her and the boy too; and now I am weak and helpless, Jem,
      she&rsquo;ll murder me for it; I know she will. If you&rsquo;d seen her cry, as I
      have, you&rsquo;d know it too. Keep her off.&rdquo; He relaxed his grasp, and sank
      back exhausted on the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew but too well what all this meant. If I could have entertained any
      doubt of it, for an instant, one glance at the woman&rsquo;s pale face and
      wasted form would have sufficiently explained the real state of the case.
      &ldquo;You had better stand aside,&rdquo; said I to the poor creature. &ldquo;You can do him
      no good. Perhaps he will be calmer, if he does not see you.&rdquo; She retired
      out of the man&rsquo;s sight. He opened his eyes after a few seconds, and looked
      anxiously round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Is she gone?&rdquo; he eagerly inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;she shall not hurt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Jem,&rdquo; said the man, in a low voice, &ldquo;she does hurt
      me. There&rsquo;s something in her eyes wakes such a dreadful fear in my heart,
      that it drives me mad. All last night, her large, staring eyes and pale
      face were close to mine; wherever I turned, they turned; and whenever I
      started up from my sleep, she was at the bedside looking at me.&rdquo; He drew
      me closer to him, as he said in a deep alarmed whisper, &ldquo;Jem, she must be
      an evil spirit&mdash;a devil! Hush! I know she is. If she had been a woman
      she would have died long ago. No woman could have borne what she has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I sickened at the thought of the long course of cruelty and neglect which
      must have occurred to produce such an impression on such a man. I could
      say nothing in reply; for who could offer hope, or consolation, to the
      abject being before me?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I sat there for upwards of two hours, during which time he tossed about,
      murmuring exclamations of pain or impatience, restlessly throwing his arms
      here and there, and turning constantly from side to side. At length he
      fell into that state of partial unconsciousness, in which the mind wanders
      uneasily from scene to scene, and from place to place, without the control
      of reason, but still without being able to divest itself of an
      indescribable sense of present suffering. Finding from his incoherent
      wanderings that this was the case, and knowing that in all probability the
      fever would not grow immediately worse, I left him, promising his
      miserable wife that I would repeat my visit next evening, and, if
      necessary, sit up with the patient during the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I kept my promise. The last four-and-twenty hours had produced a
      frightful alteration. The eyes, though deeply sunk and heavy, shone with a
      lustre frightful to behold. The lips were parched, and cracked in many
      places; the hard, dry skin glowed with a burning heat; and there was an
      almost unearthly air of wild anxiety in the man&rsquo;s face, indicating even
      more strongly the ravages of the disease. The fever was at its height.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I took the seat I had occupied the night before, and there I sat for
      hours, listening to sounds which must strike deep to the heart of the most
      callous among human beings&mdash;the awful ravings of a dying man. From
      what I had heard of the medical attendant&rsquo;s opinion, I knew there was no
      hope for him: I was sitting by his death-bed. I saw the wasted limbs&mdash;which
      a few hours before had been distorted for the amusement of a boisterous
      gallery, writhing under the tortures of a burning fever&mdash;I heard the
      clown&rsquo;s shrill laugh, blending with the low murmurings of the dying man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a touching thing to hear the mind reverting to the ordinary
      occupations and pursuits of health, when the body lies before you weak and
      helpless; but when those occupations are of a character the most strongly
      opposed to anything we associate with grave and solemn ideas, the
      impression produced is infinitely more powerful. The theatre and the
      public-house were the chief themes of the wretched man&rsquo;s wanderings. It
      was evening, he fancied; he had a part to play that night; it was late,
      and he must leave home instantly. Why did they hold him, and prevent his
      going?&mdash;he should lose the money&mdash;he must go. No! they would not
      let him. He hid his face in his burning hands, and feebly bemoaned his own
      weakness, and the cruelty of his persecutors. A short pause, and he
      shouted out a few doggerel rhymes&mdash;the last he had ever learned. He
      rose in bed, drew up his withered limbs, and rolled about in uncouth
      positions; he was acting&mdash;he was at the theatre. A minute&rsquo;s silence,
      and he murmured the burden of some roaring song. He had reached the old
      house at last&mdash;how hot the room was. He had been ill, very ill, but
      he was well now, and happy. Fill up his glass. Who was that, that dashed
      it from his lips? It was the same persecutor that had followed him before.
      He fell back upon his pillow and moaned aloud. A short period of oblivion,
      and he was wandering through a tedious maze of low-arched rooms&mdash;so
      low, sometimes, that he must creep upon his hands and knees to make his
      way along; it was close and dark, and every way he turned, some obstacle
      impeded his progress. There were insects, too, hideous crawling things,
      with eyes that stared upon him, and filled the very air around, glistening
      horribly amidst the thick darkness of the place. The walls and ceiling
      were alive with reptiles&mdash;the vault expanded to an enormous size&mdash;frightful
      figures flitted to and fro&mdash;and the faces of men he knew, rendered
      hideous by gibing and mouthing, peered out from among them; they were
      searing him with heated irons, and binding his head with cords till the
      blood started; and he struggled madly for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the close of one of these paroxysms, when I had with great difficulty
      held him down in his bed, he sank into what appeared to be a slumber.
      Overpowered with watching and exertion, I had closed my eyes for a few
      minutes, when I felt a violent clutch on my shoulder. I awoke instantly.
      He had raised himself up, so as to seat himself in bed&mdash;a dreadful
      change had come over his face, but consciousness had returned, for he
      evidently knew me. The child, who had been long since disturbed by his
      ravings, rose from its little bed, and ran towards its father, screaming
      with fright&mdash;the mother hastily caught it in her arms, lest he should
      injure it in the violence of his insanity; but, terrified by the
      alteration of his features, stood transfixed by the bedside. He grasped my
      shoulder convulsively, and, striking his breast with the other hand, made
      a desperate attempt to articulate. It was unavailing; he extended his arm
      towards them, and made another violent effort. There was a rattling noise
      in the throat&mdash;a glare of the eye&mdash;a short stifled groan&mdash;and
      he fell back&mdash;dead!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It would afford us the highest gratification to be enabled to record Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s opinion of the foregoing anecdote. We have little doubt that we
      should have been enabled to present it to our readers, but for a most
      unfortunate occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick had replaced on the table the glass which, during the last
      few sentences of the tale, he had retained in his hand; and had just made
      up his mind to speak&mdash;indeed, we have the authority of Mr.
      Snodgrass&rsquo;s note-book for stating, that he had actually opened his mouth&mdash;when
      the waiter entered the room, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some gentlemen, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been conjectured that Mr. Pickwick was on the point of delivering
      some remarks which would have enlightened the world, if not the Thames,
      when he was thus interrupted; for he gazed sternly on the waiter&rsquo;s
      countenance, and then looked round on the company generally, as if seeking
      for information relative to the new-comers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, rising, &lsquo;some friends of mine&mdash;show them in.
      Very pleasant fellows,&rsquo; added Mr. Winkle, after the waiter had retired&mdash;&lsquo;officers
      of the 97th, whose acquaintance I made rather oddly this morning. You will
      like them very much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s equanimity was at once restored. The waiter returned, and
      ushered three gentlemen into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lieutenant Tappleton,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, &lsquo;Lieutenant Tappleton, Mr.
      Pickwick&mdash;Doctor Payne, Mr. Pickwick&mdash;Mr. Snodgrass you have
      seen before, my friend Mr. Tupman, Doctor Payne&mdash;Doctor Slammer, Mr.
      Pickwick&mdash;Mr. Tupman, Doctor Slam&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Winkle suddenly paused; for strong emotion was visible on the
      countenance both of Mr. Tupman and the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have met <i>this</i> gentleman before,&rsquo; said the Doctor, with marked
      emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And&mdash;and that person, too, if I am not mistaken,&rsquo; said the doctor,
      bestowing a scrutinising glance on the green-coated stranger. &lsquo;I think I
      gave that person a very pressing invitation last night, which he thought
      proper to decline.&rsquo; Saying which the doctor scowled magnanimously on the
      stranger, and whispered his friend Lieutenant Tappleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t say so,&rsquo; said that gentleman, at the conclusion of the whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do, indeed,&rsquo; replied Doctor Slammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are bound to kick him on the spot,&rsquo; murmured the owner of the
      camp-stool, with great importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do be quiet, Payne,&rsquo; interposed the lieutenant. &lsquo;Will you allow me to ask
      you, sir,&rsquo; he said, addressing Mr. Pickwick, who was considerably
      mystified by this very unpolite by-play&mdash;&lsquo;will you allow me to ask
      you, Sir, whether that person belongs to your party?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;he is a guest of ours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a member of your club, or I am mistaken?&rsquo; said the lieutenant
      inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; responded Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And never wears your club-button?&rsquo; said the lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;never!&rsquo; replied the astonished Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Tappleton turned round to his friend Doctor Slammer, with a
      scarcely perceptible shrug of the shoulder, as if implying some doubt of
      the accuracy of his recollection. The little doctor looked wrathful, but
      confounded; and Mr. Payne gazed with a ferocious aspect on the beaming
      countenance of the unconscious Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said the doctor, suddenly addressing Mr. Tupman, in a tone which
      made that gentleman start as perceptibly as if a pin had been cunningly
      inserted in the calf of his leg, &lsquo;you were at the ball here last night!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman gasped a faint affirmative, looking very hard at Mr. Pickwick
      all the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That person was your companion,&rsquo; said the doctor, pointing to the still
      unmoved stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman admitted the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, sir,&rsquo; said the doctor to the stranger, &lsquo;I ask you once again, in the
      presence of these gentlemen, whether you choose to give me your card, and
      to receive the treatment of a gentleman; or whether you impose upon me the
      necessity of personally chastising you on the spot?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I really cannot allow this matter to go
      any further without some explanation. Tupman, recount the circumstances.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman, thus solemnly adjured, stated the case in a few words; touched
      slightly on the borrowing of the coat; expatiated largely on its having
      been done &lsquo;after dinner&rsquo;; wound up with a little penitence on his own
      account; and left the stranger to clear himself as best he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was apparently about to proceed to do so, when Lieutenant Tappleton,
      who had been eyeing him with great curiosity, said with considerable
      scorn, &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t I seen you at the theatre, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; replied the unabashed stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a strolling actor!&rsquo; said the lieutenant contemptuously, turning to
      Doctor Slammer.&mdash;&lsquo;He acts in the piece that the officers of the 52nd
      get up at the Rochester Theatre to-morrow night. You cannot proceed in
      this affair, Slammer&mdash;impossible!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite!&rsquo; said the dignified Payne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sorry to have placed you in this disagreeable situation,&rsquo; said Lieutenant
      Tappleton, addressing Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;allow me to suggest, that the best
      way of avoiding a recurrence of such scenes in future will be to be more
      select in the choice of your companions. Good-evening, Sir!&rsquo; and the
      lieutenant bounced out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And allow me to say, Sir,&rsquo; said the irascible Doctor Payne, &lsquo;that if I
      had been Tappleton, or if I had been Slammer, I would have pulled your
      nose, Sir, and the nose of every man in this company. I would, sir&mdash;every
      man. Payne is my name, sir&mdash;Doctor Payne of the 43rd. Good-evening,
      Sir.&rsquo; Having concluded this speech, and uttered the last three words in a
      loud key, he stalked majestically after his friend, closely followed by
      Doctor Slammer, who said nothing, but contented himself by withering the
      company with a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising rage and extreme bewilderment had swelled the noble breast of Mr.
      Pickwick, almost to the bursting of his waistcoat, during the delivery of
      the above defiance. He stood transfixed to the spot, gazing on vacancy.
      The closing of the door recalled him to himself. He rushed forward with
      fury in his looks, and fire in his eye. His hand was upon the lock of the
      door; in another instant it would have been on the throat of Doctor Payne
      of the 43rd, had not Mr. Snodgrass seized his revered leader by the coat
      tail, and dragged him backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Restrain him,&rsquo; cried Mr. Snodgrass; &lsquo;Winkle, Tupman&mdash;he must not
      peril his distinguished life in such a cause as this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me go,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold him tight,&rsquo; shouted Mr. Snodgrass; and by the united efforts of the
      whole company, Mr. Pickwick was forced into an arm-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave him alone,&rsquo; said the green-coated stranger; &lsquo;brandy-and-water&mdash;jolly
      old gentleman&mdash;lots of pluck&mdash;swallow this&mdash;ah!&mdash;capital
      stuff.&rsquo; Having previously tested the virtues of a bumper, which had been
      mixed by the dismal man, the stranger applied the glass to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      mouth; and the remainder of its contents rapidly disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short pause; the brandy-and-water had done its work; the
      amiable countenance of Mr. Pickwick was fast recovering its customary
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are not worth your notice,&rsquo; said the dismal man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are right, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;they are not. I am ashamed to
      have been betrayed into this warmth of feeling. Draw your chair up to the
      table, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dismal man readily complied; a circle was again formed round the
      table, and harmony once more prevailed. Some lingering irritability
      appeared to find a resting-place in Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s bosom, occasioned
      possibly by the temporary abstraction of his coat&mdash;though it is
      scarcely reasonable to suppose that so slight a circumstance can have
      excited even a passing feeling of anger in a Pickwickian&rsquo;s breast. With
      this exception, their good-humour was completely restored; and the evening
      concluded with the conviviality with which it had begun.

      CHAPTER IV. A FIELD DAY AND BIVOUAC&mdash;MORE NEW FRIENDS&mdash;AN
      INVITATION TO THE COUNTRY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>any authors
      entertain, not only a foolish, but a really dishonest objection to
      acknowledge the sources whence they derive much valuable information. We
      have no such feeling. We are merely endeavouring to discharge, in an
      upright manner, the responsible duties of our editorial functions; and
      whatever ambition we might have felt under other circumstances to lay
      claim to the authorship of these adventures, a regard for truth forbids us
      to do more than claim the merit of their judicious arrangement and
      impartial narration. The Pickwick papers are our New River Head; and we
      may be compared to the New River Company. The labours of others have
      raised for us an immense reservoir of important facts. We merely lay them
      on, and communicate them, in a clear and gentle stream, through the medium
      of these pages, to a world thirsting for Pickwickian knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acting in this spirit, and resolutely proceeding on our determination to
      avow our obligations to the authorities we have consulted, we frankly say,
      that to the note-book of Mr. Snodgrass are we indebted for the particulars
      recorded in this and the succeeding chapter&mdash;particulars which, now
      that we have disburdened our consciences, we shall proceed to detail
      without further comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole population of Rochester and the adjoining towns rose from their
      beds at an early hour of the following morning, in a state of the utmost
      bustle and excitement. A grand review was to take place upon the lines.
      The manoeuvres of half a dozen regiments were to be inspected by the eagle
      eye of the commander-in-chief; temporary fortifications had been erected,
      the citadel was to be attacked and taken, and a mine was to be sprung.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was, as our readers may have gathered from the slight extract
      we gave from his description of Chatham, an enthusiastic admirer of the
      army. Nothing could have been more delightful to him&mdash;nothing could
      have harmonised so well with the peculiar feeling of each of his
      companions&mdash;as this sight. Accordingly they were soon afoot, and
      walking in the direction of the scene of action, towards which crowds of
      people were already pouring from a variety of quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of everything on the lines denoted that the approaching
      ceremony was one of the utmost grandeur and importance. There were
      sentries posted to keep the ground for the troops, and servants on the
      batteries keeping places for the ladies, and sergeants running to and fro,
      with vellum-covered books under their arms, and Colonel Bulder, in full
      military uniform, on horseback, galloping first to one place and then to
      another, and backing his horse among the people, and prancing, and
      curvetting, and shouting in a most alarming manner, and making himself
      very hoarse in the voice, and very red in the face, without any assignable
      cause or reason whatever. Officers were running backwards and forwards,
      first communicating with Colonel Bulder, and then ordering the sergeants,
      and then running away altogether; and even the very privates themselves
      looked from behind their glazed stocks with an air of mysterious
      solemnity, which sufficiently bespoke the special nature of the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick and his three companions stationed themselves in the front of
      the crowd, and patiently awaited the commencement of the proceedings. The
      throng was increasing every moment; and the efforts they were compelled to
      make, to retain the position they had gained, sufficiently occupied their
      attention during the two hours that ensued. At one time there was a sudden
      pressure from behind, and then Mr. Pickwick was jerked forward for several
      yards, with a degree of speed and elasticity highly inconsistent with the
      general gravity of his demeanour; at another moment there was a request to
      &lsquo;keep back&rsquo; from the front, and then the butt-end of a musket was either
      dropped upon Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s toe, to remind him of the demand, or thrust
      into his chest, to insure its being complied with. Then some facetious
      gentlemen on the left, after pressing sideways in a body, and squeezing
      Mr. Snodgrass into the very last extreme of human torture, would request
      to know &lsquo;vere he vos a shovin&rsquo; to&rsquo;; and when Mr. Winkle had done
      expressing his excessive indignation at witnessing this unprovoked
      assault, some person behind would knock his hat over his eyes, and beg the
      favour of his putting his head in his pocket. These, and other practical
      witticisms, coupled with the unaccountable absence of Mr. Tupman (who had
      suddenly disappeared, and was nowhere to be found), rendered their
      situation upon the whole rather more uncomfortable than pleasing or
      desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length that low roar of many voices ran through the crowd which usually
      announces the arrival of whatever they have been waiting for. All eyes
      were turned in the direction of the sally-port. A few moments of eager
      expectation, and colours were seen fluttering gaily in the air, arms
      glistened brightly in the sun, column after column poured on to the plain.
      The troops halted and formed; the word of command rang through the line;
      there was a general clash of muskets as arms were presented; and the
      commander-in-chief, attended by Colonel Bulder and numerous officers,
      cantered to the front. The military bands struck up altogether; the horses
      stood upon two legs each, cantered backwards, and whisked their tails
      about in all directions; the dogs barked, the mob screamed, the troops
      recovered, and nothing was to be seen on either side, as far as the eye
      could reach, but a long perspective of red coats and white trousers, fixed
      and motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick had been so fully occupied in falling about, and
      disentangling himself, miraculously, from between the legs of horses, that
      he had not enjoyed sufficient leisure to observe the scene before him,
      until it assumed the appearance we have just described. When he was at
      last enabled to stand firmly on his legs, his gratification and delight
      were unbounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can anything be finer or more delightful?&rsquo; he inquired of Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; replied that gentleman, who had had a short man standing on
      each of his feet for the quarter of an hour immediately preceding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is indeed a noble and a brilliant sight,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass, in whose
      bosom a blaze of poetry was rapidly bursting forth, &lsquo;to see the gallant
      defenders of their country drawn up in brilliant array before its peaceful
      citizens; their faces beaming&mdash;not with warlike ferocity, but with
      civilised gentleness; their eyes flashing&mdash;not with the rude fire of
      rapine or revenge, but with the soft light of humanity and intelligence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick fully entered into the spirit of this eulogium, but he could
      not exactly re-echo its terms; for the soft light of intelligence burned
      rather feebly in the eyes of the warriors, inasmuch as the command &lsquo;eyes
      front&rsquo; had been given, and all the spectator saw before him was several
      thousand pair of optics, staring straight forward, wholly divested of any
      expression whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are in a capital situation now,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking round him.
      The crowd had gradually dispersed in their immediate vicinity, and they
      were nearly alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Capital!&rsquo; echoed both Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are they doing now?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, adjusting his
      spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;rather think,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, changing colour&mdash;&lsquo;I
      rather think they&rsquo;re going to fire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;really think they are,&rsquo; urged Mr. Snodgrass, somewhat
      alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. He had hardly uttered the word, when
      the whole half-dozen regiments levelled their muskets as if they had but
      one common object, and that object the Pickwickians, and burst forth with
      the most awful and tremendous discharge that ever shook the earth to its
      centres, or an elderly gentleman off his.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this trying situation, exposed to a galling fire of blank
      cartridges, and harassed by the operations of the military, a fresh body
      of whom had begun to fall in on the opposite side, that Mr. Pickwick
      displayed that perfect coolness and self-possession, which are the
      indispensable accompaniments of a great mind. He seized Mr. Winkle by the
      arm, and placing himself between that gentleman and Mr. Snodgrass,
      earnestly besought them to remember that beyond the possibility of being
      rendered deaf by the noise, there was no immediate danger to be
      apprehended from the firing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;suppose some of the men should happen to have ball
      cartridges by mistake,&rsquo; remonstrated Mr. Winkle, pallid at the supposition
      he was himself conjuring up. &lsquo;I heard something whistle through the air
      now&mdash;so sharp; close to my ear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We had better throw ourselves on our faces, hadn&rsquo;t we?&rsquo; said Mr.
      Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no&mdash;it&rsquo;s over now,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. His lip might quiver, and
      his cheek might blanch, but no expression of fear or concern escaped the
      lips of that immortal man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was right&mdash;the firing ceased; but he had scarcely time
      to congratulate himself on the accuracy of his opinion, when a quick
      movement was visible in the line; the hoarse shout of the word of command
      ran along it, and before either of the party could form a guess at the
      meaning of this new manoeuvre, the whole of the half-dozen regiments, with
      fixed bayonets, charged at double-quick time down upon the very spot on
      which Mr. Pickwick and his friends were stationed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Man is but mortal; and there is a point beyond which human courage cannot
      extend. Mr. Pickwick gazed through his spectacles for an instant on the
      advancing mass, and then fairly turned his back and&mdash;we will not say
      fled; firstly, because it is an ignoble term, and, secondly, because Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s figure was by no means adapted for that mode of retreat&mdash;he
      trotted away, at as quick a rate as his legs would convey him; so quickly,
      indeed, that he did not perceive the awkwardness of his situation, to the
      full extent, until too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opposite troops, whose falling-in had perplexed Mr. Pickwick a few
      seconds before, were drawn up to repel the mimic attack of the sham
      besiegers of the citadel; and the consequence was that Mr. Pickwick and
      his two companions found themselves suddenly inclosed between two lines of
      great length, the one advancing at a rapid pace, and the other firmly
      waiting the collision in hostile array.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hoi!&rsquo; shouted the officers of the advancing line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get out of the way!&rsquo; cried the officers of the stationary one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are we to go to?&rsquo; screamed the agitated Pickwickians.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hoi&mdash;hoi&mdash;hoi!&rsquo; was the only reply. There was a moment of
      intense bewilderment, a heavy tramp of footsteps, a violent concussion, a
      smothered laugh; the half-dozen regiments were half a thousand yards off,
      and the soles of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s boots were elevated in air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle had each performed a compulsory somerset with
      remarkable agility, when the first object that met the eyes of the latter
      as he sat on the ground, staunching with a yellow silk handkerchief the
      stream of life which issued from his nose, was his venerated leader at
      some distance off, running after his own hat, which was gambolling
      playfully away in perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are very few moments in a man&rsquo;s existence when he experiences so
      much ludicrous distress, or meets with so little charitable commiseration,
      as when he is in pursuit of his own hat. A vast deal of coolness, and a
      peculiar degree of judgment, are requisite in catching a hat. A man must
      not be precipitate, or he runs over it; he must not rush into the opposite
      extreme, or he loses it altogether. The best way is to keep gently up with
      the object of pursuit, to be wary and cautious, to watch your opportunity
      well, get gradually before it, then make a rapid dive, seize it by the
      crown, and stick it firmly on your head; smiling pleasantly all the time,
      as if you thought it as good a joke as anybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fine gentle wind, and Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s hat rolled sportively
      before it. The wind puffed, and Mr. Pickwick puffed, and the hat rolled
      over and over as merrily as a lively porpoise in a strong tide: and on it
      might have rolled, far beyond Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s reach, had not its course
      been providentially stopped, just as that gentleman was on the point of
      resigning it to its fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick, we say, was completely exhausted, and about to give up the
      chase, when the hat was blown with some violence against the wheel of a
      carriage, which was drawn up in a line with half a dozen other vehicles on
      the spot to which his steps had been directed. Mr. Pickwick, perceiving
      his advantage, darted briskly forward, secured his property, planted it on
      his head, and paused to take breath. He had not been stationary half a
      minute, when he heard his own name eagerly pronounced by a voice, which he
      at once recognised as Mr. Tupman&rsquo;s, and, looking upwards, he beheld a
      sight which filled him with surprise and pleasure.

    <p>
      In an open barouche, the horses of which had been taken out, the better to
      accommodate it to the crowded place, stood a stout old gentleman, in a
      blue coat and bright buttons, corduroy breeches and top-boots, two young
      ladies in scarfs and feathers, a young gentleman apparently enamoured of
      one of the young ladies in scarfs and feathers, a lady of doubtful age,
      probably the aunt of the aforesaid, and Mr. Tupman, as easy and
      unconcerned as if he had belonged to the family from the first moments of
      his infancy. Fastened up behind the barouche was a hamper of spacious
      dimensions&mdash;one of those hampers which always awakens in a
      contemplative mind associations connected with cold fowls, tongues, and
      bottles of wine&mdash;and on the box sat a fat and red-faced boy, in a
      state of somnolency, whom no speculative observer could have regarded for
      an instant without setting down as the official dispenser of the contents
      of the before-mentioned hamper, when the proper time for their consumption
      should arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick had bestowed a hasty glance on these interesting objects,
      when he was again greeted by his faithful disciple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pickwick&mdash;Pickwick,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman; &lsquo;come up here. Make haste.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come along, Sir. Pray, come up,&rsquo; said the stout gentleman. &lsquo;Joe!&mdash;damn
      that boy, he&rsquo;s gone to sleep again.&mdash;Joe, let down the steps.&rsquo; The
      fat boy rolled slowly off the box, let down the steps, and held the
      carriage door invitingly open. Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle came up at the
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Room for you all, gentlemen,&rsquo; said the stout man. &lsquo;Two inside, and one
      out. Joe, make room for one of these gentlemen on the box. Now, Sir, come
      along;&rsquo; and the stout gentleman extended his arm, and pulled first Mr.
      Pickwick, and then Mr. Snodgrass, into the barouche by main force. Mr.
      Winkle mounted to the box, the fat boy waddled to the same perch, and fell
      fast asleep instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, gentlemen,&rsquo; said the stout man, &lsquo;very glad to see you. Know you
      very well, gentlemen, though you mayn&rsquo;t remember me. I spent some ev&rsquo;nin&rsquo;s
      at your club last winter&mdash;picked up my friend Mr. Tupman here this
      morning, and very glad I was to see him. Well, Sir, and how are you? You
      do look uncommon well, to be sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick acknowledged the compliment, and cordially shook hands with
      the stout gentleman in the top-boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and how are you, sir?&rsquo; said the stout gentleman, addressing Mr.
      Snodgrass with paternal anxiety. &lsquo;Charming, eh? Well, that&rsquo;s right&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      right. And how are you, sir (to Mr. Winkle)? Well, I am glad to hear you
      say you are well; very glad I am, to be sure. My daughters, gentlemen&mdash;my
      gals these are; and that&rsquo;s my sister, Miss Rachael Wardle. She&rsquo;s a Miss,
      she is; and yet she ain&rsquo;t a Miss&mdash;eh, Sir, eh?&rsquo; And the stout
      gentleman playfully inserted his elbow between the ribs of Mr. Pickwick,
      and laughed very heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor, brother!&rsquo; said Miss Wardle, with a deprecating smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True, true,&rsquo; said the stout gentleman; &lsquo;no one can deny it. Gentlemen, I
      beg your pardon; this is my friend Mr. Trundle. And now you all know each
      other, let&rsquo;s be comfortable and happy, and see what&rsquo;s going forward;
      that&rsquo;s what I say.&rsquo; So the stout gentleman put on his spectacles, and Mr.
      Pickwick pulled out his glass, and everybody stood up in the carriage, and
      looked over somebody else&rsquo;s shoulder at the evolutions of the military.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astounding evolutions they were, one rank firing over the heads of another
      rank, and then running away; and then the other rank firing over the heads
      of another rank, and running away in their turn; and then forming squares,
      with officers in the centre; and then descending the trench on one side
      with scaling-ladders, and ascending it on the other again by the same
      means; and knocking down barricades of baskets, and behaving in the most
      gallant manner possible. Then there was such a ramming down of the
      contents of enormous guns on the battery, with instruments like magnified
      mops; such a preparation before they were let off, and such an awful noise
      when they did go, that the air resounded with the screams of ladies. The
      young Misses Wardle were so frightened, that Mr. Trundle was actually
      obliged to hold one of them up in the carriage, while Mr. Snodgrass
      supported the other; and Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s sister suffered under such a
      dreadful state of nervous alarm, that Mr. Tupman found it indispensably
      necessary to put his arm round her waist, to keep her up at all. Everybody
      was excited, except the fat boy, and he slept as soundly as if the roaring
      of cannon were his ordinary lullaby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Joe, Joe!&rsquo; said the stout gentleman, when the citadel was taken, and the
      besiegers and besieged sat down to dinner. &lsquo;Damn that boy, he&rsquo;s gone to
      sleep again. Be good enough to pinch him, sir&mdash;in the leg, if you
      please; nothing else wakes him&mdash;thank you. Undo the hamper, Joe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy, who had been effectually roused by the compression of a
      portion of his leg between the finger and thumb of Mr. Winkle, rolled off
      the box once again, and proceeded to unpack the hamper with more
      expedition than could have been expected from his previous inactivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now we must sit close,&rsquo; said the stout gentleman. After a great many
      jokes about squeezing the ladies&rsquo; sleeves, and a vast quantity of blushing
      at sundry jocose proposals, that the ladies should sit in the gentlemen&rsquo;s
      laps, the whole party were stowed down in the barouche; and the stout
      gentleman proceeded to hand the things from the fat boy (who had mounted
      up behind for the purpose) into the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Joe, knives and forks.&rsquo; The knives and forks were handed in, and the
      ladies and gentlemen inside, and Mr. Winkle on the box, were each
      furnished with those useful instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Plates, Joe, plates.&rsquo; A similar process employed in the distribution of
      the crockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Joe, the fowls. Damn that boy; he&rsquo;s gone to sleep again. Joe! Joe!&rsquo; 
      (Sundry taps on the head with a stick, and the fat boy, with some
      difficulty, roused from his lethargy.) &lsquo;Come, hand in the eatables.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in the sound of the last word which roused the
      unctuous boy. He jumped up, and the leaden eyes which twinkled behind his
      mountainous cheeks leered horribly upon the food as he unpacked it from
      the basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now make haste,&rsquo; said Mr. Wardle; for the fat boy was hanging fondly over
      a capon, which he seemed wholly unable to part with. The boy sighed
      deeply, and, bestowing an ardent gaze upon its plumpness, unwillingly
      consigned it to his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;look sharp. Now the tongue&mdash;now the pigeon pie.
      Take care of that veal and ham&mdash;mind the lobsters&mdash;take the
      salad out of the cloth&mdash;give me the dressing.&rsquo; Such were the hurried
      orders which issued from the lips of Mr. Wardle, as he handed in the
      different articles described, and placed dishes in everybody&rsquo;s hands, and
      on everybody&rsquo;s knees, in endless number.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now ain&rsquo;t this capital?&rsquo; inquired that jolly personage, when the work of
      destruction had commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Capital!&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, who was carving a fowl on the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Glass of wine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With the greatest pleasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better have a bottle to yourself up there, hadn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re very good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Joe!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Sir.&rsquo; (He wasn&rsquo;t asleep this time, having just succeeded in
      abstracting a veal patty.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bottle of wine to the gentleman on the box. Glad to see you, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee.&rsquo; Mr. Winkle emptied his glass, and placed the bottle on the
      coach-box, by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you permit me to have the pleasure, Sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Trundle to Mr.
      Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With great pleasure,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle to Mr. Trundle, and then the two
      gentlemen took wine, after which they took a glass of wine round, ladies
      and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How dear Emily is flirting with the strange gentleman,&rsquo; whispered the
      spinster aunt, with true spinster-aunt-like envy, to her brother, Mr.
      Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said the jolly old gentleman; &lsquo;all very natural, I
      dare say&mdash;nothing unusual. Mr. Pickwick, some wine, Sir?&rsquo; Mr.
      Pickwick, who had been deeply investigating the interior of the
      pigeon-pie, readily assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Emily, my dear,&rsquo; said the spinster aunt, with a patronising air, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
      talk so loud, love.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor, aunt!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aunt and the little old gentleman want to have it all to themselves, I
      think,&rsquo; whispered Miss Isabella Wardle to her sister Emily. The young
      ladies laughed very heartily, and the old one tried to look amiable, but
      couldn&rsquo;t manage it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Young girls have such spirits,&rsquo; said Miss Wardle to Mr. Tupman, with an
      air of gentle commiseration, as if animal spirits were contraband, and
      their possession without a permit a high crime and misdemeanour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, they have,&rsquo; replied Mr. Tupman, not exactly making the sort of reply
      that was expected from him. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s quite delightful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hem!&rsquo; said Miss Wardle, rather dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you permit me?&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, in his blandest manner, touching
      the enchanting Rachael&rsquo;s wrist with one hand, and gently elevating the
      bottle with the other. &lsquo;Will you permit me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, sir!&rsquo; Mr. Tupman looked most impressive; and Rachael expressed her
      fear that more guns were going off, in which case, of course, she should
      have required support again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think my dear nieces pretty?&rsquo; whispered their affectionate aunt to
      Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should, if their aunt wasn&rsquo;t here,&rsquo; replied the ready Pickwickian, with
      a passionate glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you naughty man&mdash;but really, if their complexions were a little
      better, don&rsquo;t you think they would be nice-looking girls&mdash;by
      candlelight?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; I think they would,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, with an air of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you quiz&mdash;I know what you were going to say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Tupman, who had not precisely made up his mind to say
      anything at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were going to say that Isabel stoops&mdash;I know you were&mdash;you
      men are such observers. Well, so she does; it can&rsquo;t be denied; and,
      certainly, if there is one thing more than another that makes a girl look
      ugly it is stooping. I often tell her that when she gets a little older
      she&rsquo;ll be quite frightful. Well, you are a quiz!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman had no objection to earning the reputation at so cheap a rate:
      so he looked very knowing, and smiled mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a sarcastic smile,&rsquo; said the admiring Rachael; &lsquo;I declare I&rsquo;m quite
      afraid of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Afraid of me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t disguise anything from me&mdash;I know what that smile
      means very well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, who had not the slightest notion himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean,&rsquo; said the amiable aunt, sinking her voice still lower&mdash;&lsquo;you
      mean, that you don&rsquo;t think Isabella&rsquo;s stooping is as bad as Emily&rsquo;s
      boldness. Well, she is bold! You cannot think how wretched it makes me
      sometimes&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I cry about it for hours together&mdash;my dear
      brother is <i>so</i> good, and so unsuspicious, that he never sees it; if
      he did, I&rsquo;m quite certain it would break his heart. I wish I could think
      it was only manner&mdash;I hope it may be&mdash;&rsquo; (Here the affectionate
      relative heaved a deep sigh, and shook her head despondingly).
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure aunt&rsquo;s talking about us,&rsquo; whispered Miss Emily Wardle to her
      sister&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m quite certain of it&mdash;she looks so malicious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she?&rsquo; replied Isabella.&mdash;&lsquo;Hem! aunt, dear!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my dear love!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> afraid you&rsquo;ll catch cold, aunt&mdash;have a silk
      handkerchief to tie round your dear old head&mdash;you really should take
      care of yourself&mdash;consider your age!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      However well deserved this piece of retaliation might have been, it was as
      vindictive a one as could well have been resorted to. There is no guessing
      in what form of reply the aunt&rsquo;s indignation would have vented itself, had
      not Mr. Wardle unconsciously changed the subject, by calling emphatically
      for Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damn that boy,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s gone to sleep again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very extraordinary boy, that,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;does he always sleep
      in this way?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sleep!&rsquo; said the old gentleman, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s always asleep. Goes on errands fast
      asleep, and snores as he waits at table.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How very odd!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! odd indeed,&rsquo; returned the old gentleman; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m proud of that boy&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t
      part with him on any account&mdash;he&rsquo;s a natural curiosity! Here, Joe&mdash;Joe&mdash;take
      these things away, and open another bottle&mdash;d&rsquo;ye hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy rose, opened his eyes, swallowed the huge piece of pie he had
      been in the act of masticating when he last fell asleep, and slowly obeyed
      his master&rsquo;s orders&mdash;gloating languidly over the remains of the
      feast, as he removed the plates, and deposited them in the hamper. The
      fresh bottle was produced, and speedily emptied: the hamper was made fast
      in its old place&mdash;the fat boy once more mounted the box&mdash;the
      spectacles and pocket-glass were again adjusted&mdash;and the evolutions
      of the military recommenced. There was a great fizzing and banging of
      guns, and starting of ladies&mdash;and then a mine was sprung, to the
      gratification of everybody&mdash;and when the mine had gone off, the
      military and the company followed its example, and went off too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, mind,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, as he shook hands with Mr. Pickwick
      at the conclusion of a conversation which had been carried on at
      intervals, during the conclusion of the proceedings, &lsquo;we shall see you all
      to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most certainly,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have got the address?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Manor Farm, Dingley Dell,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, consulting his pocket-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rsquo; said the old gentleman. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t let you off, mind, under a
      week; and undertake that you shall see everything worth seeing. If you&rsquo;ve
      come down for a country life, come to me, and I&rsquo;ll give you plenty of it.
      Joe&mdash;damn that boy, he&rsquo;s gone to sleep again&mdash;Joe, help Tom put
      in the horses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses were put in&mdash;the driver mounted&mdash;the fat boy
      clambered up by his side&mdash;farewells were exchanged&mdash;and the
      carriage rattled off. As the Pickwickians turned round to take a last
      glimpse of it, the setting sun cast a rich glow on the faces of their
      entertainers, and fell upon the form of the fat boy. His head was sunk
      upon his bosom; and he slumbered again.

      CHAPTER V. A SHORT ONE&mdash;SHOWING, AMONG OTHER MATTERS, HOW Mr.
      PICKWICK UNDERTOOK TO DRIVE, AND MR. WINKLE TO RIDE, AND HOW THEY BOTH DID
      IT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>right and pleasant
      was the sky, balmy the air, and beautiful the appearance of every object
      around, as Mr. Pickwick leaned over the balustrades of Rochester Bridge,
      contemplating nature, and waiting for breakfast. The scene was indeed one
      which might well have charmed a far less reflective mind, than that to
      which it was presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the left of the spectator lay the ruined wall, broken in many places,
      and in some, overhanging the narrow beach below in rude and heavy masses.
      Huge knots of seaweed hung upon the jagged and pointed stones, trembling
      in every breath of wind; and the green ivy clung mournfully round the dark
      and ruined battlements. Behind it rose the ancient castle, its towers
      roofless, and its massive walls crumbling away, but telling us proudly of
      its old might and strength, as when, seven hundred years ago, it rang with
      the clash of arms, or resounded with the noise of feasting and revelry. On
      either side, the banks of the Medway, covered with cornfields and
      pastures, with here and there a windmill, or a distant church, stretched
      away as far as the eye could see, presenting a rich and varied landscape,
      rendered more beautiful by the changing shadows which passed swiftly
      across it as the thin and half-formed clouds skimmed away in the light of
      the morning sun. The river, reflecting the clear blue of the sky,
      glistened and sparkled as it flowed noiselessly on; and the oars of the
      fishermen dipped into the water with a clear and liquid sound, as their
      heavy but picturesque boats glided slowly down the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was roused from the agreeable reverie into which he had been
      led by the objects before him, by a deep sigh, and a touch on his
      shoulder. He turned round: and the dismal man was at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Contemplating the scene?&rsquo; inquired the dismal man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And congratulating yourself on being up so soon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! people need to rise early, to see the sun in all his splendour, for
      his brightness seldom lasts the day through. The morning of day and the
      morning of life are but too much alike.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You speak truly, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How common the saying,&rsquo; continued the dismal man, &lsquo;&ldquo;The morning&rsquo;s too
      fine to last.&rdquo; How well might it be applied to our everyday existence.
      God! what would I forfeit to have the days of my childhood restored, or to
      be able to forget them for ever!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have seen much trouble, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick compassionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have,&rsquo; said the dismal man hurriedly; &lsquo;I have. More than those who see
      me now would believe possible.&rsquo; He paused for an instant, and then said
      abruptly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did it ever strike you, on such a morning as this, that drowning would be
      happiness and peace?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God bless me, no!&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, edging a little from the
      balustrade, as the possibility of the dismal man&rsquo;s tipping him over, by
      way of experiment, occurred to him rather forcibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have thought so, often,&rsquo; said the dismal man, without noticing the
      action. &lsquo;The calm, cool water seems to me to murmur an invitation to
      repose and rest. A bound, a splash, a brief struggle; there is an eddy for
      an instant, it gradually subsides into a gentle ripple; the waters have
      closed above your head, and the world has closed upon your miseries and
      misfortunes for ever.&rsquo; The sunken eye of the dismal man flashed brightly
      as he spoke, but the momentary excitement quickly subsided; and he turned
      calmly away, as he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&mdash;enough of that. I wish to see you on another subject. You
      invited me to read that paper, the night before last, and listened
      attentively while I did so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;and I certainly thought&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I asked for no opinion,&rsquo; said the dismal man, interrupting him, &lsquo;and I
      want none. You are travelling for amusement and instruction. Suppose I
      forward you a curious manuscript&mdash;observe, not curious because wild
      or improbable, but curious as a leaf from the romance of real life&mdash;would
      you communicate it to the club, of which you have spoken so frequently?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;if you wished it; and it would be
      entered on their transactions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall have it,&rsquo; replied the dismal man. &lsquo;Your address;&rsquo; and, Mr.
      Pickwick having communicated their probable route, the dismal man
      carefully noted it down in a greasy pocket-book, and, resisting Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s pressing invitation to breakfast, left that gentleman at his
      inn, and walked slowly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick found that his three companions had risen, and were waiting
      his arrival to commence breakfast, which was ready laid in tempting
      display. They sat down to the meal; and broiled ham, eggs, tea, coffee and
      sundries, began to disappear with a rapidity which at once bore testimony
      to the excellence of the fare, and the appetites of its consumers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, about Manor Farm,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;How shall we go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We had better consult the waiter, perhaps,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman; and the
      waiter was summoned accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dingley Dell, gentlemen&mdash;fifteen miles, gentlemen&mdash;cross road&mdash;post-chaise,
      sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Post-chaise won&rsquo;t hold more than two,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True, sir&mdash;beg your pardon, sir.&mdash;Very nice four-wheel chaise,
      sir&mdash;seat for two behind&mdash;one in front for the gentleman that
      drives&mdash;oh! beg your pardon, sir&mdash;that&rsquo;ll only hold three.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps one of the gentlemen would like to ride, sir?&rsquo; suggested the
      waiter, looking towards Mr. Winkle; &lsquo;very good saddle-horses, sir&mdash;any
      of Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s men coming to Rochester, bring &lsquo;em back, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The very thing,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Winkle, will you go on horseback?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Mr. Winkle did entertain considerable misgivings in the very lowest
      recesses of his own heart, relative to his equestrian skill; but, as he
      would not have them even suspected, on any account, he at once replied
      with great hardihood, &lsquo;Certainly. I should enjoy it of all things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle had rushed upon his fate; there was no resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let them be at the door by eleven,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, sir,&rsquo; replied the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter retired; the breakfast concluded; and the travellers ascended
      to their respective bedrooms, to prepare a change of clothing, to take
      with them on their approaching expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick had made his preliminary arrangements, and was looking over
      the coffee-room blinds at the passengers in the street, when the waiter
      entered, and announced that the chaise was ready&mdash;an announcement
      which the vehicle itself confirmed, by forthwith appearing before the
      coffee-room blinds aforesaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a curious little green box on four wheels, with a low place like a
      wine-bin for two behind, and an elevated perch for one in front, drawn by
      an immense brown horse, displaying great symmetry of bone. An hostler
      stood near, holding by the bridle another immense horse&mdash;apparently a
      near relative of the animal in the chaise&mdash;ready saddled for Mr.
      Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless my soul!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as they stood upon the pavement while
      the coats were being put in. &lsquo;Bless my soul! who&rsquo;s to drive? I never
      thought of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you, of course,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not the slightest fear, Sir,&rsquo; interposed the hostler. &lsquo;Warrant him quiet,
      Sir; a hinfant in arms might drive him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He don&rsquo;t shy, does he?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shy, sir?-he wouldn&rsquo;t shy if he was to meet a vagin-load of monkeys with
      their tails burned off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The last recommendation was indisputable. Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass got
      into the bin; Mr. Pickwick ascended to his perch, and deposited his feet
      on a floor-clothed shelf, erected beneath it for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, shiny Villiam,&rsquo; said the hostler to the deputy hostler, &lsquo;give the
      gen&rsquo;lm&rsquo;n the ribbons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shiny Villiam&rsquo;&mdash;so called, probably, from his sleek hair and oily
      countenance&mdash;placed the reins in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s left hand; and the
      upper hostler thrust a whip into his right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wo-o!&rsquo; cried Mr. Pickwick, as the tall quadruped evinced a decided
      inclination to back into the coffee-room window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wo-o!&rsquo; echoed Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass, from the bin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only his playfulness, gen&rsquo;lm&rsquo;n,&rsquo; said the head hostler encouragingly;
      &lsquo;jist kitch hold on him, Villiam.&rsquo; The deputy restrained the animal&rsquo;s
      impetuosity, and the principal ran to assist Mr. Winkle in mounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;T&rsquo;other side, sir, if you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Blowed if the gen&rsquo;lm&rsquo;n worn&rsquo;t a-gettin&rsquo; up on the wrong side,&rsquo; whispered
      a grinning post-boy to the inexpressibly gratified waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle, thus instructed, climbed into his saddle, with about as much
      difficulty as he would have experienced in getting up the side of a
      first-rate man-of-war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, with an inward presentiment that it
      was all wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let &lsquo;em go,&rsquo; cried the hostler.&mdash;&lsquo;Hold him in, sir;&rsquo; and away went
      the chaise, and the saddle-horse, with Mr. Pickwick on the box of the one,
      and Mr. Winkle on the back of the other, to the delight and gratification
      of the whole inn-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What makes him go sideways?&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass in the bin, to Mr. Winkle
      in the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle. His horse was drifting up the
      street in the most mysterious manner&mdash;side first, with his head
      towards one side of the way, and his tail towards the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick had no leisure to observe either this or any other
      particular, the whole of his faculties being concentrated in the
      management of the animal attached to the chaise, who displayed various
      peculiarities, highly interesting to a bystander, but by no means equally
      amusing to any one seated behind him. Besides constantly jerking his head
      up, in a very unpleasant and uncomfortable manner, and tugging at the
      reins to an extent which rendered it a matter of great difficulty for Mr.
      Pickwick to hold them, he had a singular propensity for darting suddenly
      every now and then to the side of the road, then stopping short, and then
      rushing forward for some minutes, at a speed which it was wholly
      impossible to control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What <i>can</i> he mean by this?&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass, when the horse had
      executed this manoeuvre for the twentieth time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; replied Mr. Tupman; &lsquo;it looks very like shying, don&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
      Mr. Snodgrass was about to reply, when he was interrupted by a shout from
      Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Woo!&rsquo; said that gentleman; &lsquo;I have dropped my whip.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Winkle,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass, as the equestrian came trotting up on the
      tall horse, with his hat over his ears, and shaking all over, as if he
      would shake to pieces, with the violence of the exercise, &lsquo;pick up the
      whip, there&rsquo;s a good fellow.&rsquo; Mr. Winkle pulled at the bridle of the tall
      horse till he was black in the face; and having at length succeeded in
      stopping him, dismounted, handed the whip to Mr. Pickwick, and grasping
      the reins, prepared to remount.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/0118m.jpg" alt="0118m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0118.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Now whether the tall horse, in the natural playfulness of his disposition,
      was desirous of having a little innocent recreation with Mr. Winkle, or
      whether it occurred to him that he could perform the journey as much to
      his own satisfaction without a rider as with one, are points upon which,
      of course, we can arrive at no definite and distinct conclusion. By
      whatever motives the animal was actuated, certain it is that Mr. Winkle
      had no sooner touched the reins, than he slipped them over his head, and
      darted backwards to their full length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor fellow,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle soothingly&mdash;&lsquo;poor fellow&mdash;good
      old horse.&rsquo; The &lsquo;poor fellow&rsquo; was proof against flattery; the more Mr.
      Winkle tried to get nearer him, the more he sidled away; and,
      notwithstanding all kinds of coaxing and wheedling, there were Mr. Winkle
      and the horse going round and round each other for ten minutes, at the end
      of which time each was at precisely the same distance from the other as
      when they first commenced&mdash;an unsatisfactory sort of thing under any
      circumstances, but particularly so in a lonely road, where no assistance
      can be procured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What am I to do?&rsquo; shouted Mr. Winkle, after the dodging had been
      prolonged for a considerable time. &lsquo;What am I to do? I can&rsquo;t get on him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better lead him till we come to a turnpike,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick
      from the chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he won&rsquo;t come!&rsquo; roared Mr. Winkle. &lsquo;Do come and hold him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was the very personation of kindness and humanity: he threw
      the reins on the horse&rsquo;s back, and having descended from his seat,
      carefully drew the chaise into the hedge, lest anything should come along
      the road, and stepped back to the assistance of his distressed companion,
      leaving Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass in the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse no sooner beheld Mr. Pickwick advancing towards him with the
      chaise whip in his hand, than he exchanged the rotary motion in which he
      had previously indulged, for a retrograde movement of so very determined a
      character, that it at once drew Mr. Winkle, who was still at the end of
      the bridle, at a rather quicker rate than fast walking, in the direction
      from which they had just come. Mr. Pickwick ran to his assistance, but the
      faster Mr. Pickwick ran forward, the faster the horse ran backward. There
      was a great scraping of feet, and kicking up of the dust; and at last Mr.
      Winkle, his arms being nearly pulled out of their sockets, fairly let go
      his hold. The horse paused, stared, shook his head, turned round, and
      quietly trotted home to Rochester, leaving Mr. Winkle and Mr. Pickwick
      gazing on each other with countenances of blank dismay. A rattling noise
      at a little distance attracted their attention. They looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless my soul!&rsquo; exclaimed the agonised Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s the other
      horse running away!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but too true. The animal was startled by the noise, and the reins
      were on his back. The results may be guessed. He tore off with the
      four-wheeled chaise behind him, and Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass in the
      four-wheeled chaise. The heat was a short one. Mr. Tupman threw himself
      into the hedge, Mr. Snodgrass followed his example, the horse dashed the
      four&mdash;wheeled chaise against a wooden bridge, separated the wheels
      from the body, and the bin from the perch; and finally stood stock still
      to gaze upon the ruin he had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first care of the two unspilt friends was to extricate their
      unfortunate companions from their bed of quickset&mdash;a process which
      gave them the unspeakable satisfaction of discovering that they had
      sustained no injury, beyond sundry rents in their garments, and various
      lacerations from the brambles. The next thing to be done was to unharness
      the horse. This complicated process having been effected, the party walked
      slowly forward, leading the horse among them, and abandoning the chaise to
      its fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour&rsquo;s walk brought the travellers to a little road-side public-house,
      with two elm-trees, a horse trough, and a signpost, in front; one or two
      deformed hay-ricks behind, a kitchen garden at the side, and rotten sheds
      and mouldering outhouses jumbled in strange confusion all about it. A
      red-headed man was working in the garden; and to him Mr. Pickwick called
      lustily, &lsquo;Hollo there!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The red-headed man raised his body, shaded his eyes with his hand, and
      stared, long and coolly, at Mr. Pickwick and his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo there!&rsquo; repeated Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo!&rsquo; was the red-headed man&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How far is it to Dingley Dell?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better er seven mile.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it a good road?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t.&rsquo; Having uttered this brief reply, and apparently satisfied
      himself with another scrutiny, the red-headed man resumed his work. &lsquo;We
      want to put this horse up here,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;I suppose we can,
      can&rsquo;t we?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Want to put that ere horse up, do ee?&rsquo; repeated the red-headed man,
      leaning on his spade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, who had by this time advanced, horse in
      hand, to the garden rails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Missus&rsquo;&mdash;roared the man with the red head, emerging from the garden,
      and looking very hard at the horse&mdash;&lsquo;missus!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall, bony woman&mdash;straight all the way down&mdash;in a coarse, blue
      pelisse, with the waist an inch or two below her arm-pits, responded to
      the call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can we put this horse up here, my good woman?&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman,
      advancing, and speaking in his most seductive tones. The woman looked very
      hard at the whole party; and the red-headed man whispered something in her
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the woman, after a little consideration, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afeerd on it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Afraid!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the woman afraid of?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It got us in trouble last time,&rsquo; said the woman, turning into the house;
      &lsquo;I woan&rsquo;t have nothin&rsquo; to say to &lsquo;un.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most extraordinary thing I have ever met with in my life,&rsquo; said the
      astonished Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;really believe,&rsquo; whispered Mr. Winkle, as his friends
      gathered round him, &lsquo;that they think we have come by this horse in some
      dishonest manner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, in a storm of indignation. Mr. Winkle
      modestly repeated his suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo, you fellow,&rsquo; said the angry Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;do you think we stole
      the horse?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure ye did,&rsquo; replied the red-headed man, with a grin which agitated
      his countenance from one auricular organ to the other. Saying which he
      turned into the house and banged the door after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s like a dream,&rsquo; ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;a hideous dream. The idea
      of a man&rsquo;s walking about all day with a dreadful horse that he can&rsquo;t get
      rid of!&rsquo; The depressed Pickwickians turned moodily away, with the tall
      quadruped, for which they all felt the most unmitigated disgust, following
      slowly at their heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the afternoon when the four friends and their four-footed
      companion turned into the lane leading to Manor Farm; and even when they
      were so near their place of destination, the pleasure they would otherwise
      have experienced was materially damped as they reflected on the
      singularity of their appearance, and the absurdity of their situation.
      Torn clothes, lacerated faces, dusty shoes, exhausted looks, and, above
      all, the horse. Oh, how Mr. Pickwick cursed that horse: he had eyed the
      noble animal from time to time with looks expressive of hatred and
      revenge; more than once he had calculated the probable amount of the
      expense he would incur by cutting his throat; and now the temptation to
      destroy him, or to cast him loose upon the world, rushed upon his mind
      with tenfold force. He was roused from a meditation on these dire
      imaginings by the sudden appearance of two figures at a turn of the lane.
      It was Mr. Wardle, and his faithful attendant, the fat boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, where have you been?&rsquo; said the hospitable old gentleman; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been
      waiting for you all day. Well, you <i>do</i> look tired. What! Scratches!
      Not hurt, I hope&mdash;eh? Well, I <i>am</i> glad to hear that&mdash;very.
      So you&rsquo;ve been spilt, eh? Never mind. Common accident in these parts. Joe&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      asleep again!&mdash;Joe, take that horse from the gentlemen, and lead it
      into the stable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy sauntered heavily behind them with the animal; and the old
      gentleman, condoling with his guests in homely phrase on so much of the
      day&rsquo;s adventures as they thought proper to communicate, led the way to the
      kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll have you put to rights here,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, &lsquo;and then
      I&rsquo;ll introduce you to the people in the parlour. Emma, bring out the
      cherry brandy; now, Jane, a needle and thread here; towels and water,
      Mary. Come, girls, bustle about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four buxom girls speedily dispersed in search of the different
      articles in requisition, while a couple of large-headed, circular-visaged
      males rose from their seats in the chimney-corner (for although it was a
      May evening their attachment to the wood fire appeared as cordial as if it
      were Christmas), and dived into some obscure recesses, from which they
      speedily produced a bottle of blacking, and some half-dozen brushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bustle!&rsquo; said the old gentleman again, but the admonition was quite
      unnecessary, for one of the girls poured out the cherry brandy, and
      another brought in the towels, and one of the men suddenly seizing Mr.
      Pickwick by the leg, at imminent hazard of throwing him off his balance,
      brushed away at his boot till his corns were red-hot; while the other
      shampooed Mr. Winkle with a heavy clothes-brush, indulging, during the
      operation, in that hissing sound which hostlers are wont to produce when
      engaged in rubbing down a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Snodgrass, having concluded his ablutions, took a survey of the room,
      while standing with his back to the fire, sipping his cherry brandy with
      heartfelt satisfaction. He describes it as a large apartment, with a red
      brick floor and a capacious chimney; the ceiling garnished with hams,
      sides of bacon, and ropes of onions. The walls were decorated with several
      hunting-whips, two or three bridles, a saddle, and an old rusty
      blunderbuss, with an inscription below it, intimating that it was &lsquo;Loaded&rsquo;&mdash;as
      it had been, on the same authority, for half a century at least. An old
      eight-day clock, of solemn and sedate demeanour, ticked gravely in one
      corner; and a silver watch, of equal antiquity, dangled from one of the
      many hooks which ornamented the dresser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ready?&rsquo; said the old gentleman inquiringly, when his guests had been
      washed, mended, brushed, and brandied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come along, then;&rsquo; and the party having traversed several dark passages,
      and being joined by Mr. Tupman, who had lingered behind to snatch a kiss
      from Emma, for which he had been duly rewarded with sundry pushings and
      scratchings, arrived at the parlour door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Welcome,&rsquo; said their hospitable host, throwing it open and stepping
      forward to announce them, &lsquo;welcome, gentlemen, to Manor Farm.&rsquo;

      CHAPTER VI. AN OLD-FASHIONED CARD-PARTY&mdash;THE CLERGYMAN&rsquo;S VERSES&mdash;THE
      STORY OF THE CONVICT&rsquo;S RETURN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>everal guests who
      were assembled in the old parlour rose to greet Mr. Pickwick and his
      friends upon their entrance; and during the performance of the ceremony of
      introduction, with all due formalities, Mr. Pickwick had leisure to
      observe the appearance, and speculate upon the characters and pursuits, of
      the persons by whom he was surrounded&mdash;a habit in which he, in common
      with many other great men, delighted to indulge.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very old lady, in a lofty cap and faded silk gown&mdash;no less a
      personage than Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s mother&mdash;occupied the post of honour on
      the right-hand corner of the chimney-piece; and various certificates of
      her having been brought up in the way she should go when young, and of her
      not having departed from it when old, ornamented the walls, in the form of
      samplers of ancient date, worsted landscapes of equal antiquity, and
      crimson silk tea-kettle holders of a more modern period. The aunt, the two
      young ladies, and Mr. Wardle, each vying with the other in paying zealous
      and unremitting attentions to the old lady, crowded round her easy-chair,
      one holding her ear-trumpet, another an orange, and a third a
      smelling-bottle, while a fourth was busily engaged in patting and punching
      the pillows which were arranged for her support. On the opposite side sat
      a bald-headed old gentleman, with a good-humoured, benevolent face&mdash;the
      clergyman of Dingley Dell; and next him sat his wife, a stout, blooming
      old lady, who looked as if she were well skilled, not only in the art and
      mystery of manufacturing home-made cordials greatly to other people&rsquo;s
      satisfaction, but of tasting them occasionally very much to her own. A
      little hard-headed, Ripstone pippin-faced man, was conversing with a fat
      old gentleman in one corner; and two or three more old gentlemen, and two
      or three more old ladies, sat bolt upright and motionless on their chairs,
      staring very hard at Mr. Pickwick and his fellow-voyagers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick, mother,&rsquo; said Mr. Wardle, at the very top of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the old lady, shaking her head; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t hear you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick, grandma!&rsquo; screamed both the young ladies together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; exclaimed the old lady. &lsquo;Well, it don&rsquo;t much matter. He don&rsquo;t care
      for an old &lsquo;ooman like me, I dare say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I assure you, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, grasping the old lady&rsquo;s hand,
      and speaking so loud that the exertion imparted a crimson hue to his
      benevolent countenance&mdash;&lsquo;I assure you, ma&rsquo;am, that nothing delights
      me more than to see a lady of your time of life heading so fine a family,
      and looking so young and well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the old lady, after a short pause: &lsquo;it&rsquo;s all very fine, I dare
      say; but I can&rsquo;t hear him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grandma&rsquo;s rather put out now,&rsquo; said Miss Isabella Wardle, in a low tone;
      &lsquo;but she&rsquo;ll talk to you presently.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick nodded his readiness to humour the infirmities of age, and
      entered into a general conversation with the other members of the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Delightful situation this,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Delightful!&rsquo; echoed Messrs. Snodgrass, Tupman, and Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I think it is,&rsquo; said Mr. Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There ain&rsquo;t a better spot o&rsquo; ground in all Kent, sir,&rsquo; said the
      hard-headed man with the pippin&mdash;face; &lsquo;there ain&rsquo;t indeed, sir&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      sure there ain&rsquo;t, Sir.&rsquo; The hard-headed man looked triumphantly round, as
      if he had been very much contradicted by somebody, but had got the better
      of him at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There ain&rsquo;t a better spot o&rsquo; ground in all Kent,&rsquo; said the hard-headed
      man again, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Cept Mullins&rsquo;s Meadows,&rsquo; observed the fat man solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mullins&rsquo;s Meadows!&rsquo; ejaculated the other, with profound contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Mullins&rsquo;s Meadows,&rsquo; repeated the fat man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Reg&rsquo;lar good land that,&rsquo; interposed another fat man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so it is, sure-ly,&rsquo; said a third fat man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everybody knows that,&rsquo; said the corpulent host.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hard-headed man looked dubiously round, but finding himself in a
      minority, assumed a compassionate air and said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are they talking about?&rsquo; inquired the old lady of one of her
      granddaughters, in a very audible voice; for, like many deaf people, she
      never seemed to calculate on the possibility of other persons hearing what
      she said herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About the land, grandma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What about the land?&mdash;Nothing the matter, is there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no. Mr. Miller was saying our land was better than Mullins&rsquo;s
      Meadows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How should he know anything about it?&rsquo; inquired the old lady indignantly.
      &lsquo;Miller&rsquo;s a conceited coxcomb, and you may tell him I said so.&rsquo; Saying
      which, the old lady, quite unconscious that she had spoken above a
      whisper, drew herself up, and looked carving-knives at the hard-headed
      delinquent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; said the bustling host, with a natural anxiety to change the
      conversation, &lsquo;what say you to a rubber, Mr. Pickwick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like it of all things,&rsquo; replied that gentleman; &lsquo;but pray don&rsquo;t
      make up one on my account.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I assure you, mother&rsquo;s very fond of a rubber,&rsquo; said Mr. Wardle;
      &lsquo;ain&rsquo;t you, mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady, who was much less deaf on this subject than on any other,
      replied in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Joe, Joe!&rsquo; said the gentleman; &lsquo;Joe&mdash;damn that&mdash;oh, here he is;
      put out the card-tables.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lethargic youth contrived without any additional rousing to set out
      two card-tables; the one for Pope Joan, and the other for whist. The
      whist-players were Mr. Pickwick and the old lady, Mr. Miller and the fat
      gentleman. The round game comprised the rest of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rubber was conducted with all that gravity of deportment and
      sedateness of demeanour which befit the pursuit entitled &lsquo;whist&rsquo;&mdash;a
      solemn observance, to which, as it appears to us, the title of &lsquo;game&rsquo; has
      been very irreverently and ignominiously applied. The round-game table, on
      the other hand, was so boisterously merry as materially to interrupt the
      contemplations of Mr. Miller, who, not being quite so much absorbed as he
      ought to have been, contrived to commit various high crimes and
      misdemeanours, which excited the wrath of the fat gentleman to a very
      great extent, and called forth the good-humour of the old lady in a
      proportionate degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; said the criminal Miller triumphantly, as he took up the odd
      trick at the conclusion of a hand; &lsquo;that could not have been played
      better, I flatter myself; impossible to have made another trick!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miller ought to have trumped the diamond, oughtn&rsquo;t he, Sir?&rsquo; said the old
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ought I, though?&rsquo; said the unfortunate, with a doubtful appeal to his
      partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ought, Sir,&rsquo; said the fat gentleman, in an awful voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very sorry,&rsquo; said the crestfallen Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Much use that,&rsquo; growled the fat gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two by honours&mdash;makes us eight,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another hand. &lsquo;Can you one?&rsquo; inquired the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Double, single, and the rub.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never was such luck,&rsquo; said Mr. Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never was such cards,&rsquo; said the fat gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      A solemn silence; Mr. Pickwick humorous, the old lady serious, the fat
      gentleman captious, and Mr. Miller timorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another double,&rsquo; said the old lady, triumphantly making a memorandum of
      the circumstance, by placing one sixpence and a battered halfpenny under
      the candlestick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A double, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite aware of the fact, Sir,&rsquo; replied the fat gentleman sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another game, with a similar result, was followed by a revoke from the
      unlucky Miller; on which the fat gentleman burst into a state of high
      personal excitement which lasted until the conclusion of the game, when he
      retired into a corner, and remained perfectly mute for one hour and
      twenty-seven minutes; at the end of which time he emerged from his
      retirement, and offered Mr. Pickwick a pinch of snuff with the air of a
      man who had made up his mind to a Christian forgiveness of injuries
      sustained. The old lady&rsquo;s hearing decidedly improved and the unlucky
      Miller felt as much out of his element as a dolphin in a sentry-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the round game proceeded right merrily. Isabella Wardle and Mr.
      Trundle &lsquo;went partners,&rsquo; and Emily Wardle and Mr. Snodgrass did the same;
      and even Mr. Tupman and the spinster aunt established a joint-stock
      company of fish and flattery. Old Mr. Wardle was in the very height of his
      jollity; and he was so funny in his management of the board, and the old
      ladies were so sharp after their winnings, that the whole table was in a
      perpetual roar of merriment and laughter. There was one old lady who
      always had about half a dozen cards to pay for, at which everybody
      laughed, regularly every round; and when the old lady looked cross at
      having to pay, they laughed louder than ever; on which the old lady&rsquo;s face
      gradually brightened up, till at last she laughed louder than any of them,
      Then, when the spinster aunt got &lsquo;matrimony,&rsquo; the young ladies laughed
      afresh, and the Spinster aunt seemed disposed to be pettish; till, feeling
      Mr. Tupman squeezing her hand under the table, she brightened up too, and
      looked rather knowing, as if matrimony in reality were not quite so far
      off as some people thought for; whereupon everybody laughed again, and
      especially old Mr. Wardle, who enjoyed a joke as much as the youngest. As
      to Mr. Snodgrass, he did nothing but whisper poetical sentiments into his
      partner&rsquo;s ear, which made one old gentleman facetiously sly, about
      partnerships at cards and partnerships for life, and caused the aforesaid
      old gentleman to make some remarks thereupon, accompanied with divers
      winks and chuckles, which made the company very merry and the old
      gentleman&rsquo;s wife especially so. And Mr. Winkle came out with jokes which
      are very well known in town, but are not all known in the country; and as
      everybody laughed at them very heartily, and said they were very capital,
      Mr. Winkle was in a state of great honour and glory. And the benevolent
      clergyman looked pleasantly on; for the happy faces which surrounded the
      table made the good old man feel happy too; and though the merriment was
      rather boisterous, still it came from the heart and not from the lips; and
      this is the right sort of merriment, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening glided swiftly away, in these cheerful recreations; and when
      the substantial though homely supper had been despatched, and the little
      party formed a social circle round the fire, Mr. Pickwick thought he had
      never felt so happy in his life, and at no time so much disposed to enjoy,
      and make the most of, the passing moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now this,&rsquo; said the hospitable host, who was sitting in great state next
      the old lady&rsquo;s arm-chair, with her hand fast clasped in his&mdash;&lsquo;this is
      just what I like&mdash;the happiest moments of my life have been passed at
      this old fireside; and I am so attached to it, that I keep up a blazing
      fire here every evening, until it actually grows too hot to bear it. Why,
      my poor old mother, here, used to sit before this fireplace upon that
      little stool when she was a girl; didn&rsquo;t you, mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The tear which starts unbidden to the eye when the recollection of old
      times and the happiness of many years ago is suddenly recalled, stole down
      the old lady&rsquo;s face as she shook her head with a melancholy smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must excuse my talking about this old place, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; resumed
      the host, after a short pause, &lsquo;for I love it dearly, and know no other&mdash;the
      old houses and fields seem like living friends to me; and so does our
      little church with the ivy, about which, by the bye, our excellent friend
      there made a song when he first came amongst us. Mr. Snodgrass, have you
      anything in your glass?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Plenty, thank you,&rsquo; replied that gentleman, whose poetic curiosity had
      been greatly excited by the last observation of his entertainer. &lsquo;I beg
      your pardon, but you were talking about the song of the Ivy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must ask our friend opposite about that,&rsquo; said the host knowingly,
      indicating the clergyman by a nod of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I say that I should like to hear you repeat it, sir?&rsquo; said Mr.
      Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, really,&rsquo; replied the clergyman, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a very slight affair; and the
      only excuse I have for having ever perpetrated it is, that I was a young
      man at the time. Such as it is, however, you shall hear it, if you wish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of curiosity was of course the reply; and the old gentleman
      proceeded to recite, with the aid of sundry promptings from his wife, the
      lines in question. &lsquo;I call them,&rsquo; said he,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       THE IVY GREEN

     Oh, a dainty plant is the Ivy green,
     That creepeth o&rsquo;er ruins old!
     Of right choice food are his meals, I ween,
     In his cell so lone and cold.
     The wall must be crumbled, the stone decayed,
     To pleasure his dainty whim;
     And the mouldering dust that years have made,
     Is a merry meal for him.
          Creeping where no life is seen,
          A rare old plant is the Ivy green.

     Fast he stealeth on, though he wears no wings,
     And a staunch old heart has he.
     How closely he twineth, how tight he clings
     To his friend the huge Oak Tree!
     And slily he traileth along the ground,
     And his leaves he gently waves,
     As he joyously hugs and crawleth round
     The rich mould of dead men&rsquo;s graves.
          Creeping where grim death has been,
          A rare old plant is the Ivy green.

     Whole ages have fled and their works decayed,
     And nations have scattered been;
     But the stout old Ivy shall never fade,
     From its hale and hearty green.
     The brave old plant in its lonely days,
     Shall fatten upon the past;
     For the stateliest building man can raise,
     Is the Ivy&rsquo;s food at last.
          Creeping on where time has been,
          A rare old plant is the Ivy green.


</pre>
    <p>
      While the old gentleman repeated these lines a second time, to enable Mr.
      Snodgrass to note them down, Mr. Pickwick perused the lineaments of his
      face with an expression of great interest. The old gentleman having
      concluded his dictation, and Mr. Snodgrass having returned his note-book
      to his pocket, Mr. Pickwick said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excuse me, sir, for making the remark on so short an acquaintance; but a
      gentleman like yourself cannot fail, I should think, to have observed many
      scenes and incidents worth recording, in the course of your experience as
      a minister of the Gospel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have witnessed some certainly,&rsquo; replied the old gentleman, &lsquo;but the
      incidents and characters have been of a homely and ordinary nature, my
      sphere of action being so very limited.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You did make some notes, I think, about John Edmunds, did you not?&rsquo; 
      inquired Mr. Wardle, who appeared very desirous to draw his friend out,
      for the edification of his new visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman slightly nodded his head in token of assent, and was
      proceeding to change the subject, when Mr. Pickwick said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir, but pray, if I may venture to inquire, who was
      John Edmunds?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The very thing I was about to ask,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are fairly in for it,&rsquo; said the jolly host. &lsquo;You must satisfy the
      curiosity of these gentlemen, sooner or later; so you had better take
      advantage of this favourable opportunity, and do so at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman smiled good-humouredly as he drew his chair forward&mdash;the
      remainder of the party drew their chairs closer together, especially Mr.
      Tupman and the spinster aunt, who were possibly rather hard of hearing;
      and the old lady&rsquo;s ear-trumpet having been duly adjusted, and Mr. Miller
      (who had fallen asleep during the recital of the verses) roused from his
      slumbers by an admonitory pinch, administered beneath the table by his

  THE CONVICT&rsquo;S RETURN
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I first settled in this village,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, &lsquo;which is
      now just five-and-twenty years ago, the most notorious person among my
      parishioners was a man of the name of Edmunds, who leased a small farm
      near this spot. He was a morose, savage-hearted, bad man; idle and
      dissolute in his habits; cruel and ferocious in his disposition. Beyond
      the few lazy and reckless vagabonds with whom he sauntered away his time
      in the fields, or sotted in the ale-house, he had not a single friend or
      acquaintance; no one cared to speak to the man whom many feared, and every
      one detested&mdash;and Edmunds was shunned by all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This man had a wife and one son, who, when I first came here, was about
      twelve years old. Of the acuteness of that woman&rsquo;s sufferings, of the
      gentle and enduring manner in which she bore them, of the agony of
      solicitude with which she reared that boy, no one can form an adequate
      conception. Heaven forgive me the supposition, if it be an uncharitable
      one, but I do firmly and in my soul believe, that the man systematically
      tried for many years to break her heart; but she bore it all for her
      child&rsquo;s sake, and, however strange it may seem to many, for his father&rsquo;s
      too; for brute as he was, and cruelly as he had treated her, she had loved
      him once; and the recollection of what he had been to her, awakened
      feelings of forbearance and meekness under suffering in her bosom, to
      which all God&rsquo;s creatures, but women, are strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They were poor&mdash;they could not be otherwise when the man pursued
      such courses; but the woman&rsquo;s unceasing and unwearied exertions, early and
      late, morning, noon, and night, kept them above actual want. These
      exertions were but ill repaid. People who passed the spot in the evening&mdash;sometimes
      at a late hour of the night&mdash;reported that they had heard the moans
      and sobs of a woman in distress, and the sound of blows; and more than
      once, when it was past midnight, the boy knocked softly at the door of a
      neighbour&rsquo;s house, whither he had been sent, to escape the drunken fury of
      his unnatural father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;During the whole of this time, and when the poor creature often bore
      about her marks of ill-usage and violence which she could not wholly
      conceal, she was a constant attendant at our little church. Regularly
      every Sunday, morning and afternoon, she occupied the same seat with the
      boy at her side; and though they were both poorly dressed&mdash;much more
      so than many of their neighbours who were in a lower station&mdash;they
      were always neat and clean. Every one had a friendly nod and a kind word
      for &ldquo;poor Mrs. Edmunds&rdquo;; and sometimes, when she stopped to exchange a few
      words with a neighbour at the conclusion of the service in the little row
      of elm-trees which leads to the church porch, or lingered behind to gaze
      with a mother&rsquo;s pride and fondness upon her healthy boy, as he sported
      before her with some little companions, her careworn face would lighten up
      with an expression of heartfelt gratitude; and she would look, if not
      cheerful and happy, at least tranquil and contented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Five or six years passed away; the boy had become a robust and well-grown
      youth. The time that had strengthened the child&rsquo;s slight frame and knit
      his weak limbs into the strength of manhood had bowed his mother&rsquo;s form,
      and enfeebled her steps; but the arm that should have supported her was no
      longer locked in hers; the face that should have cheered her, no more
      looked upon her own. She occupied her old seat, but there was a vacant one
      beside her. The Bible was kept as carefully as ever, the places were found
      and folded down as they used to be: but there was no one to read it with
      her; and the tears fell thick and fast upon the book, and blotted the
      words from her eyes. Neighbours were as kind as they were wont to be of
      old, but she shunned their greetings with averted head. There was no
      lingering among the old elm-trees now&mdash;no cheering anticipations of
      happiness yet in store. The desolate woman drew her bonnet closer over her
      face, and walked hurriedly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I tell you that the young man, who, looking back to the earliest of
      his childhood&rsquo;s days to which memory and consciousness extended, and
      carrying his recollection down to that moment, could remember nothing
      which was not in some way connected with a long series of voluntary
      privations suffered by his mother for his sake, with ill-usage, and
      insult, and violence, and all endured for him&mdash;shall I tell you, that
      he, with a reckless disregard for her breaking heart, and a sullen, wilful
      forgetfulness of all she had done and borne for him, had linked himself
      with depraved and abandoned men, and was madly pursuing a headlong career,
      which must bring death to him, and shame to her? Alas for human nature!
      You have anticipated it long since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The measure of the unhappy woman&rsquo;s misery and misfortune was about to be
      completed. Numerous offences had been committed in the neighbourhood; the
      perpetrators remained undiscovered, and their boldness increased. A
      robbery of a daring and aggravated nature occasioned a vigilance of
      pursuit, and a strictness of search, they had not calculated on. Young
      Edmunds was suspected, with three companions. He was apprehended&mdash;committed&mdash;tried&mdash;condemned&mdash;to
      die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wild and piercing shriek from a woman&rsquo;s voice, which resounded
      through the court when the solemn sentence was pronounced, rings in my
      ears at this moment. That cry struck a terror to the culprit&rsquo;s heart,
      which trial, condemnation&mdash;the approach of death itself, had failed
      to awaken. The lips which had been compressed in dogged sullenness
      throughout, quivered and parted involuntarily; the face turned ashy pale
      as the cold perspiration broke forth from every pore; the sturdy limbs of
      the felon trembled, and he staggered in the dock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the first transports of her mental anguish, the suffering mother threw
      herself on her knees at my feet, and fervently sought the Almighty Being
      who had hitherto supported her in all her troubles to release her from a
      world of woe and misery, and to spare the life of her only child. A burst
      of grief, and a violent struggle, such as I hope I may never have to
      witness again, succeeded. I knew that her heart was breaking from that
      hour; but I never once heard complaint or murmur escape her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was a piteous spectacle to see that woman in the prison-yard from day
      to day, eagerly and fervently attempting, by affection and entreaty, to
      soften the hard heart of her obdurate son. It was in vain. He remained
      moody, obstinate, and unmoved. Not even the unlooked-for commutation of
      his sentence to transportation for fourteen years, softened for an instant
      the sullen hardihood of his demeanour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the spirit of resignation and endurance that had so long upheld her,
      was unable to contend against bodily weakness and infirmity. She fell
      sick. She dragged her tottering limbs from the bed to visit her son once
      more, but her strength failed her, and she sank powerless on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now the boasted coldness and indifference of the young man were
      tested indeed; and the retribution that fell heavily upon him nearly drove
      him mad. A day passed away and his mother was not there; another flew by,
      and she came not near him; a third evening arrived, and yet he had not
      seen her&mdash;, and in four-and-twenty hours he was to be separated from
      her, perhaps for ever. Oh! how the long-forgotten thoughts of former days
      rushed upon his mind, as he almost ran up and down the narrow yard&mdash;as
      if intelligence would arrive the sooner for his hurrying&mdash;and how
      bitterly a sense of his helplessness and desolation rushed upon him, when
      he heard the truth! His mother, the only parent he had ever known, lay ill&mdash;it
      might be, dying&mdash;within one mile of the ground he stood on; were he
      free and unfettered, a few minutes would place him by her side. He rushed
      to the gate, and grasping the iron rails with the energy of desperation,
      shook it till it rang again, and threw himself against the thick wall as
      if to force a passage through the stone; but the strong building mocked
      his feeble efforts, and he beat his hands together and wept like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I bore the mother&rsquo;s forgiveness and blessing to her son in prison; and I
      carried the solemn assurance of repentance, and his fervent supplication
      for pardon, to her sick-bed. I heard, with pity and compassion, the
      repentant man devise a thousand little plans for her comfort and support
      when he returned; but I knew that many months before he could reach his
      place of destination, his mother would be no longer of this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was removed by night. A few weeks afterwards the poor woman&rsquo;s soul
      took its flight, I confidently hope, and solemnly believe, to a place of
      eternal happiness and rest. I performed the burial service over her
      remains. She lies in our little churchyard. There is no stone at her
      grave&rsquo;s head. Her sorrows were known to man; her virtues to God.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It had been arranged previously to the convict&rsquo;s departure, that he
      should write to his mother as soon as he could obtain permission, and that
      the letter should be addressed to me. The father had positively refused to
      see his son from the moment of his apprehension; and it was a matter of
      indifference to him whether he lived or died. Many years passed over
      without any intelligence of him; and when more than half his term of
      transportation had expired, and I had received no letter, I concluded him
      to be dead, as, indeed, I almost hoped he might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Edmunds, however, had been sent a considerable distance up the country on
      his arrival at the settlement; and to this circumstance, perhaps, may be
      attributed the fact, that though several letters were despatched, none of
      them ever reached my hands. He remained in the same place during the whole
      fourteen years. At the expiration of the term, steadily adhering to his
      old resolution and the pledge he gave his mother, he made his way back to
      England amidst innumerable difficulties, and returned, on foot, to his
      native place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On a fine Sunday evening, in the month of August, John Edmunds set foot
      in the village he had left with shame and disgrace seventeen years before.
      His nearest way lay through the churchyard. The man&rsquo;s heart swelled as he
      crossed the stile. The tall old elms, through whose branches the declining
      sun cast here and there a rich ray of light upon the shady part, awakened
      the associations of his earliest days. He pictured himself as he was then,
      clinging to his mother&rsquo;s hand, and walking peacefully to church. He
      remembered how he used to look up into her pale face; and how her eyes
      would sometimes fill with tears as she gazed upon his features&mdash;tears
      which fell hot upon his forehead as she stooped to kiss him, and made him
      weep too, although he little knew then what bitter tears hers were. He
      thought how often he had run merrily down that path with some childish
      playfellow, looking back, ever and again, to catch his mother&rsquo;s smile, or
      hear her gentle voice; and then a veil seemed lifted from his memory, and
      words of kindness unrequited, and warnings despised, and promises broken,
      thronged upon his recollection till his heart failed him, and he could
      bear it no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He entered the church. The evening service was concluded and the
      congregation had dispersed, but it was not yet closed. His steps echoed
      through the low building with a hollow sound, and he almost feared to be
      alone, it was so still and quiet. He looked round him. Nothing was
      changed. The place seemed smaller than it used to be; but there were the
      old monuments on which he had gazed with childish awe a thousand times;
      the little pulpit with its faded cushion; the Communion table before which
      he had so often repeated the Commandments he had reverenced as a child,
      and forgotten as a man. He approached the old seat; it looked cold and
      desolate. The cushion had been removed, and the Bible was not there.
      Perhaps his mother now occupied a poorer seat, or possibly she had grown
      infirm and could not reach the church alone. He dared not think of what he
      feared. A cold feeling crept over him, and he trembled violently as he
      turned away. &lsquo;An old man entered the porch just as he reached it. Edmunds
      started back, for he knew him well; many a time he had watched him digging
      graves in the churchyard. What would he say to the returned convict?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old man raised his eyes to the stranger&rsquo;s face, bade him
      &ldquo;good-evening,&rdquo; and walked slowly on. He had forgotten him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He walked down the hill, and through the village. The weather was warm,
      and the people were sitting at their doors, or strolling in their little
      gardens as he passed, enjoying the serenity of the evening, and their rest
      from labour. Many a look was turned towards him, and many a doubtful
      glance he cast on either side to see whether any knew and shunned him.
      There were strange faces in almost every house; in some he recognised the
      burly form of some old schoolfellow&mdash;a boy when he last saw him&mdash;surrounded
      by a troop of merry children; in others he saw, seated in an easy-chair at
      a cottage door, a feeble and infirm old man, whom he only remembered as a
      hale and hearty labourer; but they had all forgotten him, and he passed on
      unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The last soft light of the setting sun had fallen on the earth, casting a
      rich glow on the yellow corn sheaves, and lengthening the shadows of the
      orchard trees, as he stood before the old house&mdash;the home of his
      infancy&mdash;to which his heart had yearned with an intensity of
      affection not to be described, through long and weary years of captivity
      and sorrow. The paling was low, though he well remembered the time that it
      had seemed a high wall to him; and he looked over into the old garden.
      There were more seeds and gayer flowers than there used to be, but there
      were the old trees still&mdash;the very tree under which he had lain a
      thousand times when tired of playing in the sun, and felt the soft, mild
      sleep of happy boyhood steal gently upon him. There were voices within the
      house. He listened, but they fell strangely upon his ear; he knew them
      not. They were merry too; and he well knew that his poor old mother could
      not be cheerful, and he away. The door opened, and a group of little
      children bounded out, shouting and romping. The father, with a little boy
      in his arms, appeared at the door, and they crowded round him, clapping
      their tiny hands, and dragging him out, to join their joyous sports. The
      convict thought on the many times he had shrunk from his father&rsquo;s sight in
      that very place. He remembered how often he had buried his trembling head
      beneath the bedclothes, and heard the harsh word, and the hard stripe, and
      his mother&rsquo;s wailing; and though the man sobbed aloud with agony of mind
      as he left the spot, his fist was clenched, and his teeth were set, in a
      fierce and deadly passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And such was the return to which he had looked through the weary
      perspective of many years, and for which he had undergone so much
      suffering! No face of welcome, no look of forgiveness, no house to
      receive, no hand to help him&mdash;and this too in the old village. What
      was his loneliness in the wild, thick woods, where man was never seen, to
      this!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He felt that in the distant land of his bondage and infamy, he had
      thought of his native place as it was when he left it; and not as it would
      be when he returned. The sad reality struck coldly at his heart, and his
      spirit sank within him. He had not courage to make inquiries, or to
      present himself to the only person who was likely to receive him with
      kindness and compassion. He walked slowly on; and shunning the roadside
      like a guilty man, turned into a meadow he well remembered; and covering
      his face with his hands, threw himself upon the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He had not observed that a man was lying on the bank beside him; his
      garments rustled as he turned round to steal a look at the new-comer; and
      Edmunds raised his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man had moved into a sitting posture. His body was much bent, and his
      face was wrinkled and yellow. His dress denoted him an inmate of the
      workhouse: he had the appearance of being very old, but it looked more the
      effect of dissipation or disease, than the length of years. He was staring
      hard at the stranger, and though his eyes were lustreless and heavy at
      first, they appeared to glow with an unnatural and alarmed expression
      after they had been fixed upon him for a short time, until they seemed to
      be starting from their sockets. Edmunds gradually raised himself to his
      knees, and looked more and more earnestly on the old man&rsquo;s face. They
      gazed upon each other in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old man was ghastly pale. He shuddered and tottered to his feet.
      Edmunds sprang to his. He stepped back a pace or two. Edmunds advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Let me hear you speak,&rdquo; said the convict, in a thick, broken voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Stand off!&rdquo; cried the old man, with a dreadful oath. The convict drew
      closer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Stand off!&rdquo; shrieked the old man. Furious with terror, he raised his
      stick, and struck Edmunds a heavy blow across the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Father&mdash;devil!&rdquo; murmured the convict between his set teeth. He
      rushed wildly forward, and clenched the old man by the throat&mdash;but he
      was his father; and his arm fell powerless by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old man uttered a loud yell which rang through the lonely fields like
      the howl of an evil spirit. His face turned black, the gore rushed from
      his mouth and nose, and dyed the grass a deep, dark red, as he staggered
      and fell. He had ruptured a blood-vessel, and he was a dead man before his
      son could raise him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that corner of the churchyard,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, after a
      silence of a few moments, &lsquo;in that corner of the churchyard of which I
      have before spoken, there lies buried a man who was in my employment for
      three years after this event, and who was truly contrite, penitent, and
      humbled, if ever man was. No one save myself knew in that man&rsquo;s lifetime
      who he was, or whence he came&mdash;it was John Edmunds, the returned
      convict.&rsquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he fatiguing
      adventures of the day or the somniferous influence of the clergyman&rsquo;s tale
      operated so strongly on the drowsy tendencies of Mr. Pickwick, that in
      less than five minutes after he had been shown to his comfortable bedroom
      he fell into a sound and dreamless sleep, from which he was only awakened
      by the morning sun darting his bright beams reproachfully into the
      apartment. Mr. Pickwick was no sluggard, and he sprang like an ardent
      warrior from his tent-bedstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pleasant, pleasant country,&rsquo; sighed the enthusiastic gentleman, as he
      opened his lattice window. &lsquo;Who could live to gaze from day to day on
      bricks and slates who had once felt the influence of a scene like this?
      Who could continue to exist where there are no cows but the cows on the
      chimney-pots; nothing redolent of Pan but pan-tiles; no crop but stone
      crop? Who could bear to drag out a life in such a spot? Who, I ask, could
      endure it?&rsquo; and, having cross-examined solitude after the most approved
      precedents, at considerable length, Mr. Pickwick thrust his head out of
      the lattice and looked around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rich, sweet smell of the hay-ricks rose to his chamber window; the
      hundred perfumes of the little flower-garden beneath scented the air
      around; the deep-green meadows shone in the morning dew that glistened on
      every leaf as it trembled in the gentle air; and the birds sang as if
      every sparkling drop were to them a fountain of inspiration. Mr. Pickwick
      fell into an enchanting and delicious reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo!&rsquo; was the sound that roused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked to the right, but he saw nobody; his eyes wandered to the left,
      and pierced the prospect; he stared into the sky, but he wasn&rsquo;t wanted
      there; and then he did what a common mind would have done at once&mdash;looked
      into the garden, and there saw Mr. Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo; said the good-humoured individual, out of breath with his
      own anticipations of pleasure.&lsquo;Beautiful morning, ain&rsquo;t it? Glad to see
      you up so early. Make haste down, and come out. I&rsquo;ll wait for you here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick needed no second invitation. Ten minutes sufficed for the
      completion of his toilet, and at the expiration of that time he was by the
      old gentleman&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick in his turn, seeing that his companion was
      armed with a gun, and that another lay ready on the grass; &lsquo;what&rsquo;s going
      forward?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, your friend and I,&rsquo; replied the host, &lsquo;are going out rook-shooting
      before breakfast. He&rsquo;s a very good shot, ain&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard him say he&rsquo;s a capital one,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;but I
      never saw him aim at anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the host, &lsquo;I wish he&rsquo;d come. Joe&mdash;Joe!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy, who under the exciting influence of the morning did not
      appear to be more than three parts and a fraction asleep, emerged from the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go up, and call the gentleman, and tell him he&rsquo;ll find me and Mr.
      Pickwick in the rookery. Show the gentleman the way there; d&rsquo;ye hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy departed to execute his commission; and the host, carrying both
      guns like a second Robinson Crusoe, led the way from the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the place,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, pausing after a few minutes
      walking, in an avenue of trees. The information was unnecessary; for the
      incessant cawing of the unconscious rooks sufficiently indicated their
      whereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman laid one gun on the ground, and loaded the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here they are,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; and, as he spoke, the forms of Mr.
      Tupman, Mr. Snodgrass, and Mr. Winkle appeared in the distance. The fat
      boy, not being quite certain which gentleman he was directed to call, had
      with peculiar sagacity, and to prevent the possibility of any mistake,
      called them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come along,&rsquo; shouted the old gentleman, addressing Mr. Winkle; &lsquo;a keen
      hand like you ought to have been up long ago, even to such poor work as
      this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle responded with a forced smile, and took up the spare gun with
      an expression of countenance which a metaphysical rook, impressed with a
      foreboding of his approaching death by violence, may be supposed to
      assume. It might have been keenness, but it looked remarkably like misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman nodded; and two ragged boys who had been marshalled to
      the spot under the direction of the infant Lambert, forthwith commenced
      climbing up two of the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are these lads for?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick abruptly. He was rather
      alarmed; for he was not quite certain but that the distress of the
      agricultural interest, about which he had often heard a great deal, might
      have compelled the small boys attached to the soil to earn a precarious
      and hazardous subsistence by making marks of themselves for inexperienced
      sportsmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only to start the game,&rsquo; replied Mr. Wardle, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To what?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, in plain English, to frighten the rooks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, is that all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are satisfied?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well. Shall I begin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you please,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, glad of any respite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stand aside, then. Now for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy shouted, and shook a branch with a nest on it. Half a dozen young
      rooks in violent conversation, flew out to ask what the matter was. The
      old gentleman fired by way of reply. Down fell one bird, and off flew the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take him up, Joe,&rsquo; said the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a smile upon the youth&rsquo;s face as he advanced. Indistinct visions
      of rook-pie floated through his imagination. He laughed as he retired with
      the bird&mdash;it was a plump one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Mr. Winkle,&rsquo; said the host, reloading his own gun. &lsquo;Fire away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle advanced, and levelled his gun. Mr. Pickwick and his friends
      cowered involuntarily to escape damage from the heavy fall of rooks, which
      they felt quite certain would be occasioned by the devastating barrel of
      their friend. There was a solemn pause&mdash;a shout&mdash;a flapping of
      wings&mdash;a faint click.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo!&rsquo; said the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t it go?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Missed fire,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, who was very pale&mdash;probably from
      disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Odd,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, taking the gun. &lsquo;Never knew one of them
      miss fire before. Why, I don&rsquo;t see anything of the cap.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bless my soul!&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, &lsquo;I declare I forgot the cap!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The slight omission was rectified. Mr. Pickwick crouched again. Mr. Winkle
      stepped forward with an air of determination and resolution; and Mr.
      Tupman looked out from behind a tree. The boy shouted; four birds flew
      out. Mr. Winkle fired. There was a scream as of an individual&mdash;not a
      rook&mdash;in corporal anguish. Mr. Tupman had saved the lives of
      innumerable unoffending birds by receiving a portion of the charge in his
      left arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      To describe the confusion that ensued would be impossible. To tell how Mr.
      Pickwick in the first transports of emotion called Mr. Winkle &lsquo;Wretch!&rsquo; 
      how Mr. Tupman lay prostrate on the ground; and how Mr. Winkle knelt
      horror-stricken beside him; how Mr. Tupman called distractedly upon some
      feminine Christian name, and then opened first one eye, and then the
      other, and then fell back and shut them both&mdash;all this would be as
      difficult to describe in detail, as it would be to depict the gradual
      recovering of the unfortunate individual, the binding up of his arm with
      pocket-handkerchiefs, and the conveying him back by slow degrees supported
      by the arms of his anxious friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drew near the house. The ladies were at the garden gate, waiting for
      their arrival and their breakfast. The spinster aunt appeared; she smiled,
      and beckoned them to walk quicker. &lsquo;Twas evident she knew not of the
      disaster. Poor thing! there are times when ignorance is bliss indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They approached nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what is the matter with the little old gentleman?&rsquo; said Isabella
      Wardle. The spinster aunt heeded not the remark; she thought it applied to
      Mr. Pickwick. In her eyes Tracy Tupman was a youth; she viewed his years
      through a diminishing glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rsquo; called out the old host, fearful of alarming his
      daughters. The little party had crowded so completely round Mr. Tupman,
      that they could not yet clearly discern the nature of the accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rsquo; said the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; screamed the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Tupman has met with a little accident; that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The spinster aunt uttered a piercing scream, burst into an hysteric laugh,
      and fell backwards in the arms of her nieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Throw some cold water over her,&rsquo; said the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; murmured the spinster aunt; &lsquo;I am better now. Bella, Emily&mdash;a
      surgeon! Is he wounded?&mdash;Is he dead?&mdash;Is he&mdash;Ha, ha, ha!&rsquo; 
      Here the spinster aunt burst into fit number two, of hysteric laughter
      interspersed with screams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Calm yourself,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, affected almost to tears by this
      expression of sympathy with his sufferings. &lsquo;Dear, dear madam, calm
      yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is his voice!&rsquo; exclaimed the spinster aunt; and strong symptoms of fit
      number three developed themselves forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not agitate yourself, I entreat you, dearest madam,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman
      soothingly. &lsquo;I am very little hurt, I assure you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you are not dead!&rsquo; ejaculated the hysterical lady. &lsquo;Oh, say you are
      not dead!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Rachael,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Wardle, rather more roughly
      than was consistent with the poetic nature of the scene. &lsquo;What the devil&rsquo;s
      the use of his saying he isn&rsquo;t dead?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, I am not,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman. &lsquo;I require no assistance but yours.
      Let me lean on your arm.&rsquo; He added, in a whisper, &lsquo;Oh, Miss Rachael!&rsquo; The
      agitated female advanced, and offered her arm. They turned into the
      breakfast parlour. Mr. Tracy Tupman gently pressed her hand to his lips,
      and sank upon the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you faint?&rsquo; inquired the anxious Rachael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman. &lsquo;It is nothing. I shall be better presently.&rsquo; He
      closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He sleeps,&rsquo; murmured the spinster aunt. (His organs of vision had been
      closed nearly twenty seconds.) &lsquo;Dear&mdash;dear&mdash;Mr. Tupman!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman jumped up&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, say those words again!&rsquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady started. &lsquo;Surely you did not hear them!&rsquo; she said bashfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, I did!&rsquo; replied Mr. Tupman; &lsquo;repeat them. If you would have me
      recover, repeat them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hush!&rsquo; said the lady. &lsquo;My brother.&rsquo; Mr. Tracy Tupman resumed his former
      position; and Mr. Wardle, accompanied by a surgeon, entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arm was examined, the wound dressed, and pronounced to be a very
      slight one; and the minds of the company having been thus satisfied, they
      proceeded to satisfy their appetites with countenances to which an
      expression of cheerfulness was again restored. Mr. Pickwick alone was
      silent and reserved. Doubt and distrust were exhibited in his countenance.
      His confidence in Mr. Winkle had been shaken&mdash;greatly shaken&mdash;by
      the proceedings of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you a cricketer?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Wardle of the marksman.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any other time, Mr. Winkle would have replied in the affirmative. He
      felt the delicacy of his situation, and modestly replied, &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you, sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was once upon a time,&rsquo; replied the host; &lsquo;but I have given it up now. I
      subscribe to the club here, but I don&rsquo;t play.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The grand match is played to-day, I believe,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is,&rsquo; replied the host. &lsquo;Of course you would like to see it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;am delighted to view any sports which may
      be safely indulged in, and in which the impotent effects of unskilful
      people do not endanger human life.&rsquo; Mr. Pickwick paused, and looked
      steadily on Mr. Winkle, who quailed beneath his leader&rsquo;s searching glance.
      The great man withdrew his eyes after a few minutes, and added: &lsquo;Shall we
      be justified in leaving our wounded friend to the care of the ladies?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You cannot leave me in better hands,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite impossible,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was therefore settled that Mr. Tupman should be left at home in charge
      of the females; and that the remainder of the guests, under the guidance
      of Mr. Wardle, should proceed to the spot where was to be held that trial
      of skill, which had roused all Muggleton from its torpor, and inoculated
      Dingley Dell with a fever of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      As their walk, which was not above two miles long, lay through shady lanes
      and sequestered footpaths, and as their conversation turned upon the
      delightful scenery by which they were on every side surrounded, Mr.
      Pickwick was almost inclined to regret the expedition they had used, when
      he found himself in the main street of the town of Muggleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody whose genius has a topographical bent knows perfectly well that
      Muggleton is a corporate town, with a mayor, burgesses, and freemen; and
      anybody who has consulted the addresses of the mayor to the freemen, or
      the freemen to the mayor, or both to the corporation, or all three to
      Parliament, will learn from thence what they ought to have known before,
      that Muggleton is an ancient and loyal borough, mingling a zealous
      advocacy of Christian principles with a devoted attachment to commercial
      rights; in demonstration whereof, the mayor, corporation, and other
      inhabitants, have presented at divers times, no fewer than one thousand
      four hundred and twenty petitions against the continuance of negro slavery
      abroad, and an equal number against any interference with the factory
      system at home; sixty-eight in favour of the sale of livings in the
      Church, and eighty-six for abolishing Sunday trading in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick stood in the principal street of this illustrious town, and
      gazed with an air of curiosity, not unmixed with interest, on the objects
      around him. There was an open square for the market-place; and in the
      centre of it, a large inn with a sign-post in front, displaying an object
      very common in art, but rarely met with in nature&mdash;to wit, a blue
      lion, with three bow legs in the air, balancing himself on the extreme
      point of the centre claw of his fourth foot. There were, within sight, an
      auctioneer&rsquo;s and fire-agency office, a corn-factor&rsquo;s, a linen-draper&rsquo;s, a
      saddler&rsquo;s, a distiller&rsquo;s, a grocer&rsquo;s, and a shoe-shop&mdash;the
      last-mentioned warehouse being also appropriated to the diffusion of hats,
      bonnets, wearing apparel, cotton umbrellas, and useful knowledge. There
      was a red brick house with a small paved courtyard in front, which anybody
      might have known belonged to the attorney; and there was, moreover,
      another red brick house with Venetian blinds, and a large brass door-plate
      with a very legible announcement that it belonged to the surgeon. A few
      boys were making their way to the cricket-field; and two or three
      shopkeepers who were standing at their doors looked as if they should like
      to be making their way to the same spot, as indeed to all appearance they
      might have done, without losing any great amount of custom thereby. Mr.
      Pickwick having paused to make these observations, to be noted down at a
      more convenient period, hastened to rejoin his friends, who had turned out
      of the main street, and were already within sight of the field of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wickets were pitched, and so were a couple of marquees for the rest
      and refreshment of the contending parties. The game had not yet commenced.
      Two or three Dingley Dellers, and All-Muggletonians, were amusing
      themselves with a majestic air by throwing the ball carelessly from hand
      to hand; and several other gentlemen dressed like them, in straw hats,
      flannel jackets, and white trousers&mdash;a costume in which they looked
      very much like amateur stone-masons&mdash;were sprinkled about the tents,
      towards one of which Mr. Wardle conducted the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several dozen of &lsquo;How-are-you&rsquo;s?&rsquo; hailed the old gentleman&rsquo;s arrival; and
      a general raising of the straw hats, and bending forward of the flannel
      jackets, followed his introduction of his guests as gentlemen from London,
      who were extremely anxious to witness the proceedings of the day, with
      which, he had no doubt, they would be greatly delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better step into the marquee, I think, Sir,&rsquo; said one very stout
      gentleman, whose body and legs looked like half a gigantic roll of
      flannel, elevated on a couple of inflated pillow-cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find it much pleasanter, Sir,&rsquo; urged another stout gentleman, who
      strongly resembled the other half of the roll of flannel aforesaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re very good,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This way,&rsquo; said the first speaker; &lsquo;they notch in here&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
      best place in the whole field;&rsquo; and the cricketer, panting on before,
      preceded them to the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Capital game&mdash;smart sport&mdash;fine exercise&mdash;very,&rsquo; were the
      words which fell upon Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s ear as he entered the tent; and the
      first object that met his eyes was his green-coated friend of the
      Rochester coach, holding forth, to the no small delight and edification of
      a select circle of the chosen of All-Muggleton. His dress was slightly
      improved, and he wore boots; but there was no mistaking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger recognised his friends immediately; and, darting forward and
      seizing Mr. Pickwick by the hand, dragged him to a seat with his usual
      impetuosity, talking all the while as if the whole of the arrangements
      were under his especial patronage and direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This way&mdash;this way&mdash;capital fun&mdash;lots of beer&mdash;hogsheads;
      rounds of beef&mdash;bullocks; mustard&mdash;cart-loads; glorious day&mdash;down
      with you&mdash;make yourself at home&mdash;glad to see you&mdash;very.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick sat down as he was bid, and Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass also
      complied with the directions of their mysterious friend. Mr. Wardle looked
      on in silent wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Wardle&mdash;a friend of mine,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friend of yours!&mdash;My dear sir, how are you?&mdash;Friend of my
      friend&rsquo;s&mdash;give me your hand, sir&rsquo;&mdash;and the stranger grasped Mr.
      Wardle&rsquo;s hand with all the fervour of a close intimacy of many years, and
      then stepped back a pace or two as if to take a full survey of his face
      and figure, and then shook hands with him again, if possible, more warmly
      than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well; and how came you here?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with a smile in which
      benevolence struggled with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; replied the stranger&mdash;&lsquo;stopping at Crown&mdash;Crown at
      Muggleton&mdash;met a party&mdash;flannel jackets&mdash;white trousers&mdash;anchovy
      sandwiches&mdash;devilled kidney&mdash;splendid fellows&mdash;glorious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was sufficiently versed in the stranger&rsquo;s system of
      stenography to infer from this rapid and disjointed communication that he
      had, somehow or other, contracted an acquaintance with the All-Muggletons,
      which he had converted, by a process peculiar to himself, into that extent
      of good-fellowship on which a general invitation may be easily founded.
      His curiosity was therefore satisfied, and putting on his spectacles he
      prepared himself to watch the play which was just commencing.
    </p>
    <p>
      All-Muggleton had the first innings; and the interest became intense when
      Mr. Dumkins and Mr. Podder, two of the most renowned members of that most
      distinguished club, walked, bat in hand, to their respective wickets. Mr.
      Luffey, the highest ornament of Dingley Dell, was pitched to bowl against
      the redoubtable Dumkins, and Mr. Struggles was selected to do the same
      kind office for the hitherto unconquered Podder. Several players were
      stationed, to &lsquo;look out,&rsquo; in different parts of the field, and each fixed
      himself into the proper attitude by placing one hand on each knee, and
      stooping very much as if he were &lsquo;making a back&rsquo; for some beginner at
      leap-frog. All the regular players do this sort of thing;&mdash;indeed it
      is generally supposed that it is quite impossible to look out properly in
      any other position.
    </p>
    <p>
      The umpires were stationed behind the wickets; the scorers were prepared
      to notch the runs; a breathless silence ensued. Mr. Luffey retired a few
      paces behind the wicket of the passive Podder, and applied the ball to his
      right eye for several seconds. Dumkins confidently awaited its coming with
      his eyes fixed on the motions of Luffey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Play!&rsquo; suddenly cried the bowler. The ball flew from his hand straight
      and swift towards the centre stump of the wicket. The wary Dumkins was on
      the alert: it fell upon the tip of the bat, and bounded far away over the
      heads of the scouts, who had just stooped low enough to let it fly over
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Run&mdash;run&mdash;another.&mdash;Now, then throw her up&mdash;up with
      her&mdash;stop there&mdash;another&mdash;no&mdash;yes&mdash;no&mdash;throw
      her up, throw her up!&rsquo;&mdash;Such were the shouts which followed the
      stroke; and at the conclusion of which All-Muggleton had scored two. Nor
      was Podder behindhand in earning laurels wherewith to garnish himself and
      Muggleton. He blocked the doubtful balls, missed the bad ones, took the
      good ones, and sent them flying to all parts of the field. The scouts were
      hot and tired; the bowlers were changed and bowled till their arms ached;
      but Dumkins and Podder remained unconquered. Did an elderly gentleman
      essay to stop the progress of the ball, it rolled between his legs or
      slipped between his fingers. Did a slim gentleman try to catch it, it
      struck him on the nose, and bounded pleasantly off with redoubled
      violence, while the slim gentleman&rsquo;s eyes filled with water, and his form
      writhed with anguish. Was it thrown straight up to the wicket, Dumkins had
      reached it before the ball. In short, when Dumkins was caught out, and
      Podder stumped out, All-Muggleton had notched some fifty-four, while the
      score of the Dingley Dellers was as blank as their faces. The advantage
      was too great to be recovered. In vain did the eager Luffey, and the
      enthusiastic Struggles, do all that skill and experience could suggest, to
      regain the ground Dingley Dell had lost in the contest&mdash;it was of no
      avail; and in an early period of the winning game Dingley Dell gave in,
      and allowed the superior prowess of All-Muggleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger, meanwhile, had been eating, drinking, and talking, without
      cessation. At every good stroke he expressed his satisfaction and approval
      of the player in a most condescending and patronising manner, which could
      not fail to have been highly gratifying to the party concerned; while at
      every bad attempt at a catch, and every failure to stop the ball, he
      launched his personal displeasure at the head of the devoted individual in
      such denunciations as&mdash;&lsquo;Ah, ah!&mdash;stupid&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Now,
      butter-fingers&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Muff&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Humbug&rsquo;&mdash;and so forth&mdash;ejaculations
      which seemed to establish him in the opinion of all around, as a most
      excellent and undeniable judge of the whole art and mystery of the noble
      game of cricket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Capital game&mdash;well played&mdash;some strokes admirable,&rsquo; said the
      stranger, as both sides crowded into the tent, at the conclusion of the
      game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have played it, sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Wardle, who had been much amused
      by his loquacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Played it! Think I have&mdash;thousands of times&mdash;not here&mdash;West
      Indies&mdash;exciting thing&mdash;hot work&mdash;very.&rsquo; &lsquo;It must be rather
      a warm pursuit in such a climate,&rsquo; observed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Warm!&mdash;red hot&mdash;scorching&mdash;glowing. Played a match once&mdash;single
      wicket&mdash;friend the colonel&mdash;Sir Thomas Blazo&mdash;who should
      get the greatest number of runs.&mdash;Won the toss&mdash;first innings&mdash;seven
      o&rsquo;clock A.M.&mdash;six natives to look out&mdash;went in; kept in&mdash;heat
      intense&mdash;natives all fainted&mdash;taken away&mdash;fresh half-dozen
      ordered&mdash;fainted also&mdash;Blazo bowling&mdash;supported by two
      natives&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t bowl me out&mdash;fainted too&mdash;cleared away
      the colonel&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t give in&mdash;faithful attendant&mdash;Quanko
      Samba&mdash;last man left&mdash;sun so hot, bat in blisters, ball scorched
      brown&mdash;five hundred and seventy runs&mdash;rather exhausted&mdash;Quanko
      mustered up last remaining strength&mdash;bowled me out&mdash;had a bath,
      and went out to dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what became of what&rsquo;s-his-name, Sir?&rsquo; inquired an old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Blazo?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;the other gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Quanko Samba?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Quanko&mdash;never recovered it&mdash;bowled on, on my account&mdash;bowled
      off, on his own&mdash;died, sir.&rsquo; Here the stranger buried his countenance
      in a brown jug, but whether to hide his emotion or imbibe its contents, we
      cannot distinctly affirm. We only know that he paused suddenly, drew a
      long and deep breath, and looked anxiously on, as two of the principal
      members of the Dingley Dell club approached Mr. Pickwick, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are about to partake of a plain dinner at the Blue Lion, Sir; we hope
      you and your friends will join us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course,&rsquo; said Mr. Wardle, &lsquo;among our friends we include Mr.&mdash;;&rsquo; 
      and he looked towards the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jingle,&rsquo; said that versatile gentleman, taking the hint at once. &lsquo;Jingle&mdash;Alfred
      Jingle, Esq., of No Hall, Nowhere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be very happy, I am sure,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So shall I,&rsquo; said Mr. Alfred Jingle, drawing one arm through Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s, and another through Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s, as he whispered
      confidentially in the ear of the former gentleman:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Devilish good dinner&mdash;cold, but capital&mdash;peeped into the room
      this morning&mdash;fowls and pies, and all that sort of thing&mdash;pleasant
      fellows these&mdash;well behaved, too&mdash;very.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There being no further preliminaries to arrange, the company straggled
      into the town in little knots of twos and threes; and within a quarter of
      an hour were all seated in the great room of the Blue Lion Inn, Muggleton&mdash;Mr.
      Dumkins acting as chairman, and Mr. Luffey officiating as vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a vast deal of talking and rattling of knives and forks, and
      plates; a great running about of three ponderous-headed waiters, and a
      rapid disappearance of the substantial viands on the table; to each and
      every of which item of confusion, the facetious Mr. Jingle lent the aid of
      half-a-dozen ordinary men at least. When everybody had eaten as much as
      possible, the cloth was removed, bottles, glasses, and dessert were placed
      on the table; and the waiters withdrew to &lsquo;clear away,&rsquo; or in other words,
      to appropriate to their own private use and emolument whatever remnants of
      the eatables and drinkables they could contrive to lay their hands on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst the general hum of mirth and conversation that ensued, there was a
      little man with a puffy Say-nothing-to-me,-or-I&rsquo;ll-contradict-you sort of
      countenance, who remained very quiet; occasionally looking round him when
      the conversation slackened, as if he contemplated putting in something
      very weighty; and now and then bursting into a short cough of
      inexpressible grandeur. At length, during a moment of comparative silence,
      the little man called out in a very loud, solemn voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Luffey!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody was hushed into a profound stillness as the individual
      addressed, replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish to address a few words to you, Sir, if you will entreat the
      gentlemen to fill their glasses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jingle uttered a patronising &lsquo;Hear, hear,&rsquo; which was responded to by
      the remainder of the company; and the glasses having been filled, the
      vice-president assumed an air of wisdom in a state of profound attention;
      and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Staple.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said the little man, rising, &lsquo;I wish to address what I have to say
      to you and not to our worthy chairman, because our worthy chairman is in
      some measure&mdash;I may say in a great degree&mdash;the subject of what I
      have to say, or I may say to&mdash;to&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;State,&rsquo; suggested Mr. Jingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, to state,&rsquo; said the little man, &lsquo;I thank my honourable friend, if he
      will allow me to call him so (four hears and one certainly from Mr.
      Jingle), for the suggestion. Sir, I am a Deller&mdash;a Dingley Deller
      (cheers). I cannot lay claim to the honour of forming an item in the
      population of Muggleton; nor, Sir, I will frankly admit, do I covet that
      honour: and I will tell you why, Sir (hear); to Muggleton I will readily
      concede all these honours and distinctions to which it can fairly lay
      claim&mdash;they are too numerous and too well known to require aid or
      recapitulation from me. But, sir, while we remember that Muggleton has
      given birth to a Dumkins and a Podder, let us never forget that Dingley
      Dell can boast a Luffey and a Struggles. (Vociferous cheering.) Let me not
      be considered as wishing to detract from the merits of the former
      gentlemen. Sir, I envy them the luxury of their own feelings on this
      occasion. (Cheers.) Every gentleman who hears me, is probably acquainted
      with the reply made by an individual, who&mdash;to use an ordinary figure
      of speech&mdash;&ldquo;hung out&rdquo; in a tub, to the emperor Alexander:&mdash;&ldquo;if I
      were not Diogenes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I would be Alexander.&rdquo; I can well imagine
      these gentlemen to say, &ldquo;If I were not Dumkins I would be Luffey; if I
      were not Podder I would be Struggles.&rdquo; (Enthusiasm.) But, gentlemen of
      Muggleton, is it in cricket alone that your fellow-townsmen stand
      pre-eminent? Have you never heard of Dumkins and determination? Have you
      never been taught to associate Podder with property? (Great applause.)
      Have you never, when struggling for your rights, your liberties, and your
      privileges, been reduced, if only for an instant, to misgiving and
      despair? And when you have been thus depressed, has not the name of
      Dumkins laid afresh within your breast the fire which had just gone out;
      and has not a word from that man lighted it again as brightly as if it had
      never expired? (Great cheering.) Gentlemen, I beg to surround with a rich
      halo of enthusiastic cheering the united names of &ldquo;Dumkins and Podder.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the little man ceased, and here the company commenced a raising of
      voices, and thumping of tables, which lasted with little intermission
      during the remainder of the evening. Other toasts were drunk. Mr. Luffey
      and Mr. Struggles, Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Jingle, were, each in his turn,
      the subject of unqualified eulogium; and each in due course returned
      thanks for the honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enthusiastic as we are in the noble cause to which we have devoted
      ourselves, we should have felt a sensation of pride which we cannot
      express, and a consciousness of having done something to merit immortality
      of which we are now deprived, could we have laid the faintest outline on
      these addresses before our ardent readers. Mr. Snodgrass, as usual, took a
      great mass of notes, which would no doubt have afforded most useful and
      valuable information, had not the burning eloquence of the words or the
      feverish influence of the wine made that gentleman&rsquo;s hand so extremely
      unsteady, as to render his writing nearly unintelligible, and his style
      wholly so. By dint of patient investigation, we have been enabled to trace
      some characters bearing a faint resemblance to the names of the speakers;
      and we can only discern an entry of a song (supposed to have been sung by
      Mr. Jingle), in which the words &lsquo;bowl&rsquo; &lsquo;sparkling&rsquo; &lsquo;ruby&rsquo; &lsquo;bright&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;wine&rsquo; are frequently repeated at short intervals. We fancy, too, that we
      can discern at the very end of the notes, some indistinct reference to
      &lsquo;broiled bones&rsquo;; and then the words &lsquo;cold&rsquo; &lsquo;without&rsquo; occur: but as any
      hypothesis we could found upon them must necessarily rest upon mere
      conjecture, we are not disposed to indulge in any of the speculations to
      which they may give rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will therefore return to Mr. Tupman; merely adding that within some few
      minutes before twelve o&rsquo;clock that night, the convocation of worthies of
      Dingley Dell and Muggleton were heard to sing, with great feeling and
      emphasis, the beautiful and pathetic national air of
    </p>

      CHAPTER VIII. STRONGLY ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE POSITION, THAT THE COURSE OF
      TRUE LOVE IS NOT A RAILWAY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he quiet seclusion
      of Dingley Dell, the presence of so many of the gentler sex, and the
      solicitude and anxiety they evinced in his behalf, were all favourable to
      the growth and development of those softer feelings which nature had
      implanted deep in the bosom of Mr. Tracy Tupman, and which now appeared
      destined to centre in one lovely object. The young ladies were pretty,
      their manners winning, their dispositions unexceptionable; but there was a
      dignity in the air, a touch-me-not-ishness in the walk, a majesty in the
      eye, of the spinster aunt, to which, at their time of life, they could lay
      no claim, which distinguished her from any female on whom Mr. Tupman had
      ever gazed. That there was something kindred in their nature, something
      congenial in their souls, something mysteriously sympathetic in their
      bosoms, was evident. Her name was the first that rose to Mr. Tupman&rsquo;s lips
      as he lay wounded on the grass; and her hysteric laughter was the first
      sound that fell upon his ear when he was supported to the house. But had
      her agitation arisen from an amiable and feminine sensibility which would
      have been equally irrepressible in any case; or had it been called forth
      by a more ardent and passionate feeling, which he, of all men living,
      could alone awaken? These were the doubts which racked his brain as he lay
      extended on the sofa; these were the doubts which he determined should be
      at once and for ever resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evening. Isabella and Emily had strolled out with Mr. Trundle; the
      deaf old lady had fallen asleep in her chair; the snoring of the fat boy,
      penetrated in a low and monotonous sound from the distant kitchen; the
      buxom servants were lounging at the side door, enjoying the pleasantness
      of the hour, and the delights of a flirtation, on first principles, with
      certain unwieldy animals attached to the farm; and there sat the
      interesting pair, uncared for by all, caring for none, and dreaming only
      of themselves; there they sat, in short, like a pair of carefully-folded
      kid gloves&mdash;bound up in each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have forgotten my flowers,&rsquo; said the spinster aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Water them now,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, in accents of persuasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will take cold in the evening air,&rsquo; urged the spinster aunt
      affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, rising; &lsquo;it will do me good. Let me accompany
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady paused to adjust the sling in which the left arm of the youth was
      placed, and taking his right arm led him to the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a bower at the farther end, with honeysuckle, jessamine, and
      creeping plants&mdash;one of those sweet retreats which humane men erect
      for the accommodation of spiders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spinster aunt took up a large watering-pot which lay in one corner,
      and was about to leave the arbour. Mr. Tupman detained her, and drew her
      to a seat beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Wardle!&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spinster aunt trembled, till some pebbles which had accidentally found
      their way into the large watering-pot shook like an infant&rsquo;s rattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Wardle,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, &lsquo;you are an angel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Tupman!&rsquo; exclaimed Rachael, blushing as red as the watering-pot
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said the eloquent Pickwickian&mdash;&lsquo;I know it but too well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All women are angels, they say,&rsquo; murmured the lady playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then what can you be; or to what, without presumption, can I compare
      you?&rsquo; replied Mr. Tupman. &lsquo;Where was the woman ever seen who resembled
      you? Where else could I hope to find so rare a combination of excellence
      and beauty? Where else could I seek to&mdash;Oh!&rsquo; Here Mr. Tupman paused,
      and pressed the hand which clasped the handle of the happy watering-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady turned aside her head. &lsquo;Men are such deceivers,&rsquo; she softly
      whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are, they are,&rsquo; ejaculated Mr. Tupman; &lsquo;but not all men. There lives
      at least one being who can never change&mdash;one being who would be
      content to devote his whole existence to your happiness&mdash;who lives
      but in your eyes&mdash;who breathes but in your smiles&mdash;who bears the
      heavy burden of life itself only for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Could such an individual be found&mdash;&rsquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he <i>can</i> be found,&rsquo; said the ardent Mr. Tupman, interposing. &lsquo;He
      <i>is</i> found. He is here, Miss Wardle.&rsquo; And ere the lady was aware of
      his intention, Mr. Tupman had sunk upon his knees at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Tupman, rise,&rsquo; said Rachael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; was the valorous reply. &lsquo;Oh, Rachael!&rsquo; He seized her passive
      hand, and the watering-pot fell to the ground as he pressed it to his
      lips.&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, Rachael! say you love me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Tupman,&rsquo; said the spinster aunt, with averted head, &lsquo;I can hardly
      speak the words; but&mdash;but&mdash;you are not wholly indifferent to
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman no sooner heard this avowal, than he proceeded to do what his
      enthusiastic emotions prompted, and what, for aught we know (for we are
      but little acquainted with such matters), people so circumstanced always
      do. He jumped up, and, throwing his arm round the neck of the spinster
      aunt, imprinted upon her lips numerous kisses, which after a due show of
      struggling and resistance, she received so passively, that there is no
      telling how many more Mr. Tupman might have bestowed, if the lady had not
      given a very unaffected start, and exclaimed in an affrighted tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Tupman, we are observed!&mdash;we are discovered!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman looked round. There was the fat boy, perfectly motionless, with
      his large circular eyes staring into the arbour, but without the slightest
      expression on his face that the most expert physiognomist could have
      referred to astonishment, curiosity, or any other known passion that
      agitates the human breast. Mr. Tupman gazed on the fat boy, and the fat
      boy stared at him; and the longer Mr. Tupman observed the utter vacancy of
      the fat boy&rsquo;s countenance, the more convinced he became that he either did
      not know, or did not understand, anything that had been going forward.
      Under this impression, he said with great firmness&mdash;
    </p>

      <a href="images/0164.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want here, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Supper&rsquo;s ready, sir,&rsquo; was the prompt reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you just come here, sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Tupman, with a piercing look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just,&rsquo; replied the fat boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman looked at him very hard again; but there was not a wink in his
      eye, or a curve in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman took the arm of the spinster aunt, and walked towards the
      house; the fat boy followed behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He knows nothing of what has happened,&rsquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; said the spinster aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound behind them, as of an imperfectly suppressed chuckle.
      Mr. Tupman turned sharply round. No; it could not have been the fat boy;
      there was not a gleam of mirth, or anything but feeding in his whole
      visage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must have been fast asleep,&rsquo; whispered Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not the least doubt of it,&rsquo; replied the spinster aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both laughed heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman was wrong. The fat boy, for once, had not been fast asleep. He
      was awake&mdash;wide awake&mdash;to what had been going forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper passed off without any attempt at a general conversation. The
      old lady had gone to bed; Isabella Wardle devoted herself exclusively to
      Mr. Trundle; the spinster&rsquo;s attentions were reserved for Mr. Tupman; and
      Emily&rsquo;s thoughts appeared to be engrossed by some distant object&mdash;possibly
      they were with the absent Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleven&mdash;twelve&mdash;one o&rsquo;clock had struck, and the gentlemen had
      not arrived. Consternation sat on every face. Could they have been waylaid
      and robbed? Should they send men and lanterns in every direction by which
      they could be supposed likely to have travelled home? or should they&mdash;Hark!
      there they were. What could have made them so late? A strange voice, too!
      To whom could it belong? They rushed into the kitchen, whither the truants
      had repaired, and at once obtained rather more than a glimmering of the
      real state of the case.

    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick, with his hands in his pockets and his hat cocked completely
      over his left eye, was leaning against the dresser, shaking his head from
      side to side, and producing a constant succession of the blandest and most
      benevolent smiles without being moved thereunto by any discernible cause
      or pretence whatsoever; old Mr. Wardle, with a highly-inflamed
      countenance, was grasping the hand of a strange gentleman muttering
      protestations of eternal friendship; Mr. Winkle, supporting himself by the
      eight-day clock, was feebly invoking destruction upon the head of any
      member of the family who should suggest the propriety of his retiring for
      the night; and Mr. Snodgrass had sunk into a chair, with an expression of
      the most abject and hopeless misery that the human mind can imagine,
      portrayed in every lineament of his expressive face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is anything the matter?&rsquo; inquired the three ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing the matter,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;re&mdash;all
      right.&mdash;I say, Wardle, we&rsquo;re all right, ain&rsquo;t we?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think so,&rsquo; replied the jolly host.&mdash;&lsquo;My dears, here&rsquo;s my
      friend Mr. Jingle&mdash;Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s friend, Mr. Jingle, come &lsquo;pon&mdash;little
      visit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is anything the matter with Mr. Snodgrass, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Emily, with
      great anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing the matter, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied the stranger. &lsquo;Cricket dinner&mdash;glorious
      party&mdash;capital songs&mdash;old port&mdash;claret&mdash;good&mdash;very
      good&mdash;wine, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;wine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/0168m.jpg" alt="0168m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0168.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the wine,&rsquo; murmured Mr. Snodgrass, in a broken voice. &lsquo;It was
      the salmon.&rsquo; (Somehow or other, it never is the wine, in these cases.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hadn&rsquo;t they better go to bed, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; inquired Emma. &lsquo;Two of the boys
      will carry the gentlemen upstairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t go to bed,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No living boy shall carry me,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick stoutly; and he went on
      smiling as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hurrah!&rsquo; gasped Mr. Winkle faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hurrah!&rsquo; echoed Mr. Pickwick, taking off his hat and dashing it on the
      floor, and insanely casting his spectacles into the middle of the kitchen.
      At this humorous feat he laughed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s&mdash;have&mdash;&lsquo;nother&mdash;bottle,&rsquo; cried Mr. Winkle,
      commencing in a very loud key, and ending in a very faint one. His head
      dropped upon his breast; and, muttering his invincible determination not
      to go to his bed, and a sanguinary regret that he had not &lsquo;done for old
      Tupman&rsquo; in the morning, he fell fast asleep; in which condition he was
      borne to his apartment by two young giants under the personal
      superintendence of the fat boy, to whose protecting care Mr. Snodgrass
      shortly afterwards confided his own person, Mr. Pickwick accepted the
      proffered arm of Mr. Tupman and quietly disappeared, smiling more than
      ever; and Mr. Wardle, after taking as affectionate a leave of the whole
      family as if he were ordered for immediate execution, consigned to Mr.
      Trundle the honour of conveying him upstairs, and retired, with a very
      futile attempt to look impressively solemn and dignified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a shocking scene!&rsquo; said the spinster aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dis-gusting!&rsquo; ejaculated both the young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dreadful&mdash;dreadful!&rsquo; said Jingle, looking very grave: he was about a
      bottle and a half ahead of any of his companions. &lsquo;Horrid spectacle&mdash;very!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a nice man!&rsquo; whispered the spinster aunt to Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-looking, too!&rsquo; whispered Emily Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, decidedly,&rsquo; observed the spinster aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman thought of the widow at Rochester, and his mind was troubled.
      The succeeding half-hour&rsquo;s conversation was not of a nature to calm his
      perturbed spirit. The new visitor was very talkative, and the number of
      his anecdotes was only to be exceeded by the extent of his politeness. Mr.
      Tupman felt that as Jingle&rsquo;s popularity increased, he (Tupman) retired
      further into the shade. His laughter was forced&mdash;his merriment
      feigned; and when at last he laid his aching temples between the sheets,
      he thought, with horrid delight, on the satisfaction it would afford him
      to have Jingle&rsquo;s head at that moment between the feather bed and the
      mattress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The indefatigable stranger rose betimes next morning, and, although his
      companions remained in bed overpowered with the dissipation of the
      previous night, exerted himself most successfully to promote the hilarity
      of the breakfast-table. So successful were his efforts, that even the deaf
      old lady insisted on having one or two of his best jokes retailed through
      the trumpet; and even she condescended to observe to the spinster aunt,
      that &lsquo;He&rsquo; (meaning Jingle) &lsquo;was an impudent young fellow:&rsquo; a sentiment in
      which all her relations then and there present thoroughly coincided.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the old lady&rsquo;s habit on the fine summer mornings to repair to the
      arbour in which Mr. Tupman had already signalised himself, in form and
      manner following: first, the fat boy fetched from a peg behind the old
      lady&rsquo;s bedroom door, a close black satin bonnet, a warm cotton shawl, and
      a thick stick with a capacious handle; and the old lady, having put on the
      bonnet and shawl at her leisure, would lean one hand on the stick and the
      other on the fat boy&rsquo;s shoulder, and walk leisurely to the arbour, where
      the fat boy would leave her to enjoy the fresh air for the space of half
      an hour; at the expiration of which time he would return and reconduct her
      to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady was very precise and very particular; and as this ceremony
      had been observed for three successive summers without the slightest
      deviation from the accustomed form, she was not a little surprised on this
      particular morning to see the fat boy, instead of leaving the arbour, walk
      a few paces out of it, look carefully round him in every direction, and
      return towards her with great stealth and an air of the most profound
      mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady was timorous&mdash;most old ladies are&mdash;and her first
      impression was that the bloated lad was about to do her some grievous
      bodily harm with the view of possessing himself of her loose coin. She
      would have cried for assistance, but age and infirmity had long ago
      deprived her of the power of screaming; she, therefore, watched his
      motions with feelings of intense horror which were in no degree diminished
      by his coming close up to her, and shouting in her ear in an agitated, and
      as it seemed to her, a threatening tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Missus!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it so happened that Mr. Jingle was walking in the garden close to the
      arbour at that moment. He too heard the shouts of &lsquo;Missus,&rsquo; and stopped to
      hear more. There were three reasons for his doing so. In the first place,
      he was idle and curious; secondly, he was by no means scrupulous; thirdly,
      and lastly, he was concealed from view by some flowering shrubs. So there
      he stood, and there he listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Missus!&rsquo; shouted the fat boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Joe,&rsquo; said the trembling old lady. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I have been a good
      mistress to you, Joe. You have invariably been treated very kindly. You
      have never had too much to do; and you have always had enough to eat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This last was an appeal to the fat boy&rsquo;s most sensitive feelings. He
      seemed touched, as he replied emphatically&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knows I has.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then what can you want to do now?&rsquo; said the old lady, gaining courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wants to make your flesh creep,&rsquo; replied the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sounded like a very bloodthirsty mode of showing one&rsquo;s gratitude; and
      as the old lady did not precisely understand the process by which such a
      result was to be attained, all her former horrors returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think I see in this very arbour last night?&rsquo; inquired the
      boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless us! What?&rsquo; exclaimed the old lady, alarmed at the solemn manner of
      the corpulent youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The strange gentleman&mdash;him as had his arm hurt&mdash;a-kissin&rsquo; and
      huggin&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who, Joe? None of the servants, I hope.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Worser than that,&rsquo; roared the fat boy, in the old lady&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not one of my grandda&rsquo;aters?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Worser than that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Worse than that, Joe!&rsquo; said the old lady, who had thought this the
      extreme limit of human atrocity. &lsquo;Who was it, Joe? I insist upon knowing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy looked cautiously round, and having concluded his survey,
      shouted in the old lady&rsquo;s ear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Rachael.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; said the old lady, in a shrill tone. &lsquo;Speak louder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Rachael,&rsquo; roared the fat boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My da&rsquo;ater!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The train of nods which the fat boy gave by way of assent, communicated a
      blanc-mange like motion to his fat cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And she suffered him!&rsquo; exclaimed the old lady. A grin stole over the fat
      boy&rsquo;s features as he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see her a-kissin&rsquo; of him agin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Jingle, from his place of concealment, could have beheld the
      expression which the old lady&rsquo;s face assumed at this communication, the
      probability is that a sudden burst of laughter would have betrayed his
      close vicinity to the summer-house. He listened attentively. Fragments of
      angry sentences such as, &lsquo;Without my permission!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;At her time of
      life&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Miserable old &lsquo;ooman like me&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Might have waited till I
      was dead,&rsquo; and so forth, reached his ears; and then he heard the heels of
      the fat boy&rsquo;s boots crunching the gravel, as he retired and left the old
      lady alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a remarkable coincidence perhaps, but it was nevertheless a fact,
      that Mr. Jingle within five minutes of his arrival at Manor Farm on the
      preceding night, had inwardly resolved to lay siege to the heart of the
      spinster aunt, without delay. He had observation enough to see, that his
      off-hand manner was by no means disagreeable to the fair object of his
      attack; and he had more than a strong suspicion that she possessed that
      most desirable of all requisites, a small independence. The imperative
      necessity of ousting his rival by some means or other, flashed quickly
      upon him, and he immediately resolved to adopt certain proceedings tending
      to that end and object, without a moment&rsquo;s delay. Fielding tells us that
      man is fire, and woman tow, and the Prince of Darkness sets a light to
      &lsquo;em. Mr. Jingle knew that young men, to spinster aunts, are as lighted gas
      to gunpowder, and he determined to essay the effect of an explosion
      without loss of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of reflections upon this important decision, he crept from his place
      of concealment, and, under cover of the shrubs before mentioned,
      approached the house. Fortune seemed determined to favour his design. Mr.
      Tupman and the rest of the gentlemen left the garden by the side gate just
      as he obtained a view of it; and the young ladies, he knew, had walked out
      alone, soon after breakfast. The coast was clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast-parlour door was partially open. He peeped in. The spinster
      aunt was knitting. He coughed; she looked up and smiled. Hesitation formed
      no part of Mr. Alfred Jingle&rsquo;s character. He laid his finger on his lips
      mysteriously, walked in, and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Wardle,&rsquo; said Mr. Jingle, with affected earnestness, &lsquo;forgive
      intrusion&mdash;short acquaintance&mdash;no time for ceremony&mdash;all
      discovered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir!&rsquo; said the spinster aunt, rather astonished by the unexpected
      apparition and somewhat doubtful of Mr. Jingle&rsquo;s sanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said Mr. Jingle, in a stage-whisper&mdash;&lsquo;Large boy&mdash;dumpling
      face&mdash;round eyes&mdash;rascal!&rsquo; Here he shook his head expressively,
      and the spinster aunt trembled with agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I presume you allude to Joseph, Sir?&rsquo; said the lady, making an effort to
      appear composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;damn that Joe!&mdash;treacherous dog, Joe&mdash;told the
      old lady&mdash;old lady furious&mdash;wild&mdash;raving&mdash;arbour&mdash;Tupman&mdash;kissing
      and hugging&mdash;all that sort of thing&mdash;eh, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Jingle,&rsquo; said the spinster aunt, &lsquo;if you come here, Sir, to insult me&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all&mdash;by no means,&rsquo; replied the unabashed Mr. Jingle&mdash;&lsquo;overheard
      the tale&mdash;came to warn you of your danger&mdash;tender my services&mdash;prevent
      the hubbub. Never mind&mdash;think it an insult&mdash;leave the room&rsquo;&mdash;and
      he turned, as if to carry the threat into execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What <i>shall</i> I do!&rsquo; said the poor spinster, bursting into tears. &lsquo;My
      brother will be furious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course he will,&rsquo; said Mr. Jingle pausing&mdash;&lsquo;outrageous.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Mr. Jingle, what <i>can</i> I say!&rsquo; exclaimed the spinster aunt, in
      another flood of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say he dreamt it,&rsquo; replied Mr. Jingle coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ray of comfort darted across the mind of the spinster aunt at this
      suggestion. Mr. Jingle perceived it, and followed up his advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pooh, pooh!&mdash;nothing more easy&mdash;blackguard boy&mdash;lovely
      woman&mdash;fat boy horsewhipped&mdash;you believed&mdash;end of the
      matter&mdash;all comfortable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the probability of escaping from the consequences of this
      ill-timed discovery was delightful to the spinster&rsquo;s feelings, or whether
      the hearing herself described as a &lsquo;lovely woman&rsquo; softened the asperity of
      her grief, we know not. She blushed slightly, and cast a grateful look on
      Mr. Jingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      That insinuating gentleman sighed deeply, fixed his eyes on the spinster
      aunt&rsquo;s face for a couple of minutes, started melodramatically, and
      suddenly withdrew them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You seem unhappy, Mr. Jingle,&rsquo; said the lady, in a plaintive voice. &lsquo;May
      I show my gratitude for your kind interference, by inquiring into the
      cause, with a view, if possible, to its removal?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Jingle, with another start&mdash;&lsquo;removal! remove my
      unhappiness, and your love bestowed upon a man who is insensible to the
      blessing&mdash;who even now contemplates a design upon the affections of
      the niece of the creature who&mdash;but no; he is my friend; I will not
      expose his vices. Miss Wardle&mdash;farewell!&rsquo; At the conclusion of this
      address, the most consecutive he was ever known to utter, Mr. Jingle
      applied to his eyes the remnant of a handkerchief before noticed, and
      turned towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay, Mr. Jingle!&rsquo; said the spinster aunt emphatically. &lsquo;You have made an
      allusion to Mr. Tupman&mdash;explain it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; exclaimed Jingle, with a professional (i.e., theatrical) air.
      &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; and, by way of showing that he had no desire to be questioned
      further, he drew a chair close to that of the spinster aunt and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Jingle,&rsquo; said the aunt, &lsquo;I entreat&mdash;I implore you, if there is
      any dreadful mystery connected with Mr. Tupman, reveal it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can I,&rsquo; said Mr. Jingle, fixing his eyes on the aunt&rsquo;s face&mdash;&lsquo;can I
      see&mdash;lovely creature&mdash;sacrificed at the shrine&mdash;heartless
      avarice!&rsquo; He appeared to be struggling with various conflicting emotions
      for a few seconds, and then said in a low voice&mdash; &lsquo;Tupman only wants
      your money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wretch!&rsquo; exclaimed the spinster, with energetic indignation. (Mr.
      Jingle&rsquo;s doubts were resolved. She <i>had</i> money.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More than that,&rsquo; said Jingle&mdash;&lsquo;loves another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another!&rsquo; ejaculated the spinster. &lsquo;Who?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Short girl&mdash;black eyes&mdash;niece Emily.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if there was one individual in the whole world, of whom the spinster
      aunt entertained a mortal and deep-rooted jealousy, it was this identical
      niece. The colour rushed over her face and neck, and she tossed her head
      in silence with an air of ineffable contempt. At last, biting her thin
      lips, and bridling up, she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be. I won&rsquo;t believe it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Watch &lsquo;em,&rsquo; said Jingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said the aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Watch his looks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His whispers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll sit next her at table.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll flatter her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll pay her every possible attention.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he&rsquo;ll cut you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cut <i>me</i>!&rsquo; screamed the spinster aunt. &lsquo;<i>he</i> cut <i>me</i>;
      will he!&rsquo; and she trembled with rage and disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will convince yourself?&rsquo; said Jingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll show your spirit?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      You&rsquo;ll not have him afterwards?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll take somebody else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jingle fell on his knees, remained thereupon for five minutes
      thereafter; and rose the accepted lover of the spinster aunt&mdash;conditionally
      upon Mr. Tupman&rsquo;s perjury being made clear and manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The burden of proof lay with Mr. Alfred Jingle; and he produced his
      evidence that very day at dinner. The spinster aunt could hardly believe
      her eyes. Mr. Tracy Tupman was established at Emily&rsquo;s side, ogling,
      whispering, and smiling, in opposition to Mr. Snodgrass. Not a word, not a
      look, not a glance, did he bestow upon his heart&rsquo;s pride of the evening
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damn that boy!&rsquo; thought old Mr. Wardle to himself.&mdash;He had heard the
      story from his mother. &lsquo;Damn that boy! He must have been asleep. It&rsquo;s all
      imagination.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Traitor!&rsquo; thought the spinster aunt. &lsquo;Dear Mr. Jingle was not deceiving
      me. Ugh! how I hate the wretch!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The following conversation may serve to explain to our readers this
      apparently unaccountable alteration of deportment on the part of Mr. Tracy
      Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time was evening; the scene the garden. There were two figures walking
      in a side path; one was rather short and stout; the other tall and slim.
      They were Mr. Tupman and Mr. Jingle. The stout figure commenced the
      dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did I do it?&rsquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Splendid&mdash;capital&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t act better myself&mdash;you must
      repeat the part to-morrow&mdash;every evening till further notice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does Rachael still wish it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course&mdash;she don&rsquo;t like it&mdash;but must be done&mdash;avert
      suspicion&mdash;afraid of her brother&mdash;says there&rsquo;s no help for it&mdash;only
      a few days more&mdash;when old folks blinded&mdash;crown your happiness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any message?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Love&mdash;best love&mdash;kindest regards&mdash;unalterable affection.
      Can I say anything for you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear fellow,&rsquo; replied the unsuspicious Mr. Tupman, fervently grasping
      his &lsquo;friend&rsquo;s&rsquo; hand&mdash;&lsquo;carry my best love&mdash;say how hard I find it
      to dissemble&mdash;say anything that&rsquo;s kind: but add how sensible I am of
      the necessity of the suggestion she made to me, through you, this morning.
      Say I applaud her wisdom and admire her discretion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I will. Anything more?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, only add how ardently I long for the time when I may call her
      mine, and all dissimulation may be unnecessary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, certainly. Anything more?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, my friend!&rsquo; said poor Mr. Tupman, again grasping the hand of his
      companion, &lsquo;receive my warmest thanks for your disinterested kindness; and
      forgive me if I have ever, even in thought, done you the injustice of
      supposing that you could stand in my way. My dear friend, can I ever repay
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of it,&rsquo; replied Mr. Jingle. He stopped short, as if suddenly
      recollecting something, and said&mdash;&lsquo;By the bye&mdash;can&rsquo;t spare ten
      pounds, can you?&mdash;very particular purpose&mdash;pay you in three
      days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say I can,&rsquo; replied Mr. Tupman, in the fulness of his heart.
      &lsquo;Three days, you say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only three days&mdash;all over then&mdash;no more difficulties.&rsquo; Mr.
      Tupman counted the money into his companion&rsquo;s hand, and he dropped it
      piece by piece into his pocket, as they walked towards the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be careful,&rsquo; said Mr. Jingle&mdash;&lsquo;not a look.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a wink,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a syllable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a whisper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All your attentions to the niece&mdash;rather rude, than otherwise, to
      the aunt&mdash;only way of deceiving the old ones.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take care,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> take care,&rsquo; said Mr. Jingle internally; and they entered
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene of that afternoon was repeated that evening, and on the three
      afternoons and evenings next ensuing. On the fourth, the host was in high
      spirits, for he had satisfied himself that there was no ground for the
      charge against Mr. Tupman. So was Mr. Tupman, for Mr. Jingle had told him
      that his affair would soon be brought to a crisis. So was Mr. Pickwick,
      for he was seldom otherwise. So was not Mr. Snodgrass, for he had grown
      jealous of Mr. Tupman. So was the old lady, for she had been winning at
      whist. So were Mr. Jingle and Miss Wardle, for reasons of sufficient
      importance in this eventful history to be narrated in another chapter.

      CHAPTER IX. A DISCOVERY AND A CHASE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he supper was
      ready laid, the chairs were drawn round the table, bottles, jugs, and
      glasses were arranged upon the sideboard, and everything betokened the
      approach of the most convivial period in the whole four-and-twenty hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Rachael?&rsquo; said Mr. Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, and Jingle?&rsquo; added Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said the host, &lsquo;I wonder I haven&rsquo;t missed him before. Why, I
      don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve heard his voice for two hours at least. Emily, my dear,
      ring the bell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell was rung, and the fat boy appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Miss Rachael?&rsquo; He couldn&rsquo;t say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Jingle, then?&rsquo; He didn&rsquo;t know. Everybody looked surprised. It
      was late&mdash;past eleven o&rsquo;clock. Mr. Tupman laughed in his sleeve. They
      were loitering somewhere, talking about him. Ha, ha! capital notion that&mdash;funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said Wardle, after a short pause. &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll turn up
      presently, I dare say. I never wait supper for anybody.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excellent rule, that,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick&mdash;&lsquo;admirable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, sit down,&rsquo; said the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; and down they sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a gigantic round of cold beef on the table, and Mr. Pickwick was
      supplied with a plentiful portion of it. He had raised his fork to his
      lips, and was on the very point of opening his mouth for the reception of
      a piece of beef, when the hum of many voices suddenly arose in the
      kitchen. He paused, and laid down his fork. Mr. Wardle paused too, and
      insensibly released his hold of the carving-knife, which remained inserted
      in the beef. He looked at Mr. Pickwick. Mr. Pickwick looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavy footsteps were heard in the passage; the parlour door was suddenly
      burst open; and the man who had cleaned Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s boots on his first
      arrival, rushed into the room, followed by the fat boy and all the
      domestics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What the devil&rsquo;s the meaning of this?&rsquo; exclaimed the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The kitchen chimney ain&rsquo;t a-fire, is it, Emma?&rsquo; inquired the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor, grandma! No,&rsquo; screamed both the young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; roared the master of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man gasped for breath, and faintly ejaculated&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They ha&rsquo; gone, mas&rsquo;r!&mdash;gone right clean off, Sir!&rsquo; (At this juncture
      Mr. Tupman was observed to lay down his knife and fork, and to turn very
      pale.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s gone?&rsquo; said Mr. Wardle fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mus&rsquo;r Jingle and Miss Rachael, in a po&rsquo;-chay, from Blue Lion, Muggleton.
      I was there; but I couldn&rsquo;t stop &lsquo;em; so I run off to tell &lsquo;ee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I paid his expenses!&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, jumping up frantically. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s got
      ten pounds of mine!&mdash;stop him!&mdash;he&rsquo;s swindled me!&mdash;I won&rsquo;t
      bear it!&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have justice, Pickwick!&mdash;I won&rsquo;t stand it!&rsquo; and
      with sundry incoherent exclamations of the like nature, the unhappy
      gentleman spun round and round the apartment, in a transport of frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord preserve us!&rsquo; ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, eyeing the extraordinary
      gestures of his friend with terrified surprise. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s gone mad! What shall
      we do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Do!&rsquo; said the stout old host, who regarded only the last words of the
      sentence. &lsquo;Put the horse in the gig! I&rsquo;ll get a chaise at the Lion, and
      follow &lsquo;em instantly. Where?&rsquo;&mdash;he exclaimed, as the man ran out to
      execute the commission&mdash;&lsquo;where&rsquo;s that villain, Joe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here I am! but I hain&rsquo;t a willin,&rsquo; replied a voice. It was the fat boy&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me get at him, Pickwick,&rsquo; cried Wardle, as he rushed at the
      ill-starred youth. &lsquo;He was bribed by that scoundrel, Jingle, to put me on
      a wrong scent, by telling a cock-and-bull story of my sister and your
      friend Tupman!&rsquo; (Here Mr. Tupman sank into a chair.) &lsquo;Let me get at him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let him!&rsquo; screamed all the women, above whose exclamations the
      blubbering of the fat boy was distinctly audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t be held!&rsquo; cried the old man. &lsquo;Mr. Winkle, take your hands off.
      Mr. Pickwick, let me go, sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful sight, in that moment of turmoil and confusion, to
      behold the placid and philosophical expression of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s face,
      albeit somewhat flushed with exertion, as he stood with his arms firmly
      clasped round the extensive waist of their corpulent host, thus
      restraining the impetuosity of his passion, while the fat boy was
      scratched, and pulled, and pushed from the room by all the females
      congregated therein. He had no sooner released his hold, than the man
      entered to announce that the gig was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let him go alone!&rsquo; screamed the females. &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll kill somebody!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go with him,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a good fellow, Pickwick,&rsquo; said the host, grasping his hand. &lsquo;Emma,
      give Mr. Pickwick a shawl to tie round his neck&mdash;make haste. Look
      after your grandmother, girls; she has fainted away. Now then, are you
      ready?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s mouth and chin having been hastily enveloped in a large
      shawl, his hat having been put on his head, and his greatcoat thrown over
      his arm, he replied in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      They jumped into the gig. &lsquo;Give her her head, Tom,&rsquo; cried the host; and
      away they went, down the narrow lanes; jolting in and out of the
      cart-ruts, and bumping up against the hedges on either side, as if they
      would go to pieces every moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How much are they ahead?&rsquo; shouted Wardle, as they drove up to the door of
      the Blue Lion, round which a little crowd had collected, late as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not above three-quarters of an hour,&rsquo; was everybody&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chaise-and-four directly!&mdash;out with &lsquo;em! Put up the gig afterwards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, boys!&rsquo; cried the landlord&mdash;&lsquo;chaise-and-four out&mdash;make
      haste&mdash;look alive there!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Away ran the hostlers and the boys. The lanterns glimmered, as the men ran
      to and fro; the horses&rsquo; hoofs clattered on the uneven paving of the yard;
      the chaise rumbled as it was drawn out of the coach-house; and all was
      noise and bustle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now then!&mdash;is that chaise coming out to-night?&rsquo; cried Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Coming down the yard now, Sir,&rsquo; replied the hostler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out came the chaise&mdash;in went the horses&mdash;on sprang the boys&mdash;in
      got the travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind&mdash;the seven-mile stage in less than half an hour!&rsquo; shouted
      Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Off with you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys applied whip and spur, the waiters shouted, the hostlers cheered,
      and away they went, fast and furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty situation,&rsquo; thought Mr. Pickwick, when he had had a moment&rsquo;s time
      for reflection. &lsquo;Pretty situation for the general chairman of the Pickwick
      Club. Damp chaise&mdash;strange horses&mdash;fifteen miles an hour&mdash;and
      twelve o&rsquo;clock at night!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first three or four miles, not a word was spoken by either of the
      gentlemen, each being too much immersed in his own reflections to address
      any observations to his companion. When they had gone over that much
      ground, however, and the horses getting thoroughly warmed began to do
      their work in really good style, Mr. Pickwick became too much exhilarated
      with the rapidity of the motion, to remain any longer perfectly mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;re sure to catch them, I think,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hope so,&rsquo; replied his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fine night,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking up at the moon, which was shining
      brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So much the worse,&rsquo; returned Wardle; &lsquo;for they&rsquo;ll have had all the
      advantage of the moonlight to get the start of us, and we shall lose it.
      It will have gone down in another hour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be rather unpleasant going at this rate in the dark, won&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
      inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say it will,&rsquo; replied his friend dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s temporary excitement began to sober down a little, as he
      reflected upon the inconveniences and dangers of the expedition in which
      he had so thoughtlessly embarked. He was roused by a loud shouting of the
      post-boy on the leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yo-yo-yo-yo-yoe!&rsquo; went the first boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yo-yo-yo-yoe!&rsquo; went the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yo-yo-yo-yoe!&rsquo; chimed in old Wardle himself, most lustily, with his head
      and half his body out of the coach window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yo-yo-yo-yoe!&rsquo; shouted Mr. Pickwick, taking up the burden of the cry,
      though he had not the slightest notion of its meaning or object. And
      amidst the yo-yoing of the whole four, the chaise stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a gate here,&rsquo; replied old Wardle. &lsquo;We shall hear something of the
      fugitives.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After a lapse of five minutes, consumed in incessant knocking and
      shouting, an old man in his shirt and trousers emerged from the
      turnpike-house, and opened the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long is it since a post-chaise went through here?&rsquo; inquired Mr.
      Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t rightly know. It worn&rsquo;t a long time ago, nor it worn&rsquo;t a
      short time ago&mdash;just between the two, perhaps.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has any chaise been by at all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, there&rsquo;s been a chay by.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long ago, my friend,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;an hour?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I dare say it might be,&rsquo; replied the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or two hours?&rsquo; inquired the post&mdash;boy on the wheeler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it was,&rsquo; returned the old man doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drive on, boys,&rsquo; cried the testy old gentleman; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t waste any more
      time with that old idiot!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Idiot!&rsquo; exclaimed the old man with a grin, as he stood in the middle of
      the road with the gate half-closed, watching the chaise which rapidly
      diminished in the increasing distance. &lsquo;No&mdash;not much o&rsquo; that either;
      you&rsquo;ve lost ten minutes here, and gone away as wise as you came, arter
      all. If every man on the line as has a guinea give him, earns it half as
      well, you won&rsquo;t catch t&rsquo;other chay this side Mich&rsquo;lmas, old
      short-and-fat.&rsquo; And with another prolonged grin, the old man closed the
      gate, re-entered his house, and bolted the door after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the chaise proceeded, without any slackening of pace, towards
      the conclusion of the stage. The moon, as Wardle had foretold, was rapidly
      on the wane; large tiers of dark, heavy clouds, which had been gradually
      overspreading the sky for some time past, now formed one black mass
      overhead; and large drops of rain which pattered every now and then
      against the windows of the chaise, seemed to warn the travellers of the
      rapid approach of a stormy night. The wind, too, which was directly
      against them, swept in furious gusts down the narrow road, and howled
      dismally through the trees which skirted the pathway. Mr. Pickwick drew
      his coat closer about him, coiled himself more snugly up into the corner
      of the chaise, and fell into a sound sleep, from which he was only
      awakened by the stopping of the vehicle, the sound of the hostler&rsquo;s bell,
      and a loud cry of &lsquo;Horses on directly!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But here another delay occurred. The boys were sleeping with such
      mysterious soundness, that it took five minutes a-piece to wake them. The
      hostler had somehow or other mislaid the key of the stable, and even when
      that was found, two sleepy helpers put the wrong harness on the wrong
      horses, and the whole process of harnessing had to be gone through afresh.
      Had Mr. Pickwick been alone, these multiplied obstacles would have
      completely put an end to the pursuit at once, but old Wardle was not to be
      so easily daunted; and he laid about him with such hearty good-will,
      cuffing this man, and pushing that; strapping a buckle here, and taking in
      a link there, that the chaise was ready in a much shorter time than could
      reasonably have been expected, under so many difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      They resumed their journey; and certainly the prospect before them was by
      no means encouraging. The stage was fifteen miles long, the night was
      dark, the wind high, and the rain pouring in torrents. It was impossible
      to make any great way against such obstacles united; it was hard upon one
      o&rsquo;clock already; and nearly two hours were consumed in getting to the end
      of the stage. Here, however, an object presented itself, which rekindled
      their hopes, and reanimated their drooping spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When did this chaise come in?&rsquo; cried old Wardle, leaping out of his own
      vehicle, and pointing to one covered with wet mud, which was standing in
      the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a quarter of an hour ago, sir,&rsquo; replied the hostler, to whom the
      question was addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lady and gentleman?&rsquo; inquired Wardle, almost breathless with impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tall gentleman&mdash;dress-coat&mdash;long legs&mdash;thin body?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elderly lady&mdash;thin face&mdash;rather skinny&mdash;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By heavens, it&rsquo;s the couple, Pickwick,&rsquo; exclaimed the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would have been here before,&rsquo; said the hostler, &lsquo;but they broke a trace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis them!&rsquo; said Wardle, &lsquo;it is, by Jove! Chaise-and-four instantly! We
      shall catch them yet before they reach the next stage. A guinea a-piece,
      boys-be alive there&mdash;bustle about&mdash;there&rsquo;s good fellows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And with such admonitions as these, the old gentleman ran up and down the
      yard, and bustled to and fro, in a state of excitement which communicated
      itself to Mr. Pickwick also; and under the influence of which, that
      gentleman got himself into complicated entanglements with harness, and
      mixed up with horses and wheels of chaises, in the most surprising manner,
      firmly believing that by so doing he was materially forwarding the
      preparations for their resuming their journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jump in&mdash;jump in!&rsquo; cried old Wardle, climbing into the chaise,
      pulling up the steps, and slamming the door after him. &lsquo;Come along! Make
      haste!&rsquo; And before Mr. Pickwick knew precisely what he was about, he felt
      himself forced in at the other door, by one pull from the old gentleman
      and one push from the hostler; and off they were again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! we are moving now,&rsquo; said the old gentleman exultingly. They were
      indeed, as was sufficiently testified to Mr. Pickwick, by his constant
      collision either with the hard wood-work of the chaise, or the body of his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold up!&rsquo; said the stout old Mr. Wardle, as Mr. Pickwick dived head
      foremost into his capacious waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never did feel such a jolting in my life,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; replied his companion, &lsquo;it will soon be over. Steady,
      steady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick planted himself into his own corner, as firmly as he could;
      and on whirled the chaise faster than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had travelled in this way about three miles, when Mr. Wardle, who had
      been looking out of the Window for two or three minutes, suddenly drew in
      his face, covered with splashes, and exclaimed in breathless eagerness&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here they are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick thrust his head out of his window. Yes: there was a
      chaise-and-four, a short distance before them, dashing along at full
      gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go on, go on,&rsquo; almost shrieked the old gentleman. &lsquo;Two guineas a-piece,
      boys&mdash;don&rsquo;t let &lsquo;em gain on us&mdash;keep it up&mdash;keep it up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses in the first chaise started on at their utmost speed; and those
      in Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s galloped furiously behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see his head,&rsquo; exclaimed the choleric old man; &lsquo;damme, I see his head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So do I&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s he.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was not mistaken. The countenance of Mr. Jingle, completely
      coated with mud thrown up by the wheels, was plainly discernible at the
      window of his chaise; and the motion of his arm, which was waving
      violently towards the postillions, denoted that he was encouraging them to
      increased exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interest was intense. Fields, trees, and hedges, seemed to rush past
      them with the velocity of a whirlwind, so rapid was the pace at which they
      tore along. They were close by the side of the first chaise. Jingle&rsquo;s
      voice could be plainly heard, even above the din of the wheels, urging on
      the boys. Old Mr. Wardle foamed with rage and excitement. He roared out
      scoundrels and villains by the dozen, clenched his fist and shook it
      expressively at the object of his indignation; but Mr. Jingle only
      answered with a contemptuous smile, and replied to his menaces by a shout
      of triumph, as his horses, answering the increased application of whip and
      spur, broke into a faster gallop, and left the pursuers behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick had just drawn in his head, and Mr. Wardle, exhausted with
      shouting, had done the same, when a tremendous jolt threw them forward
      against the front of the vehicle. There was a sudden bump&mdash;a loud
      crash&mdash;away rolled a wheel, and over went the chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a very few seconds of bewilderment and confusion, in which nothing
      but the plunging of horses, and breaking of glass could be made out, Mr.
      Pickwick felt himself violently pulled out from among the ruins of the
      chaise; and as soon as he had gained his feet, extricated his head from the
      skirts of his greatcoat, which materially impeded the usefulness of his
      spectacles, the full disaster of the case met his view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mr. Wardle without a hat, and his clothes torn in several places,
      stood by his side, and the fragments of the chaise lay scattered at their
      feet. The post-boys, who had succeeded in cutting the traces, were
      standing, disfigured with mud and disordered by hard riding, by the
      horses&rsquo; heads. About a hundred yards in advance was the other chaise,
      which had pulled up on hearing the crash. The postillions, each with a
      broad grin convulsing his countenance, were viewing the adverse party from
      their saddles, and Mr. Jingle was contemplating the wreck from the coach
      window, with evident satisfaction. The day was just breaking, and the
      whole scene was rendered perfectly visible by the grey light of the
      morning.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/0190m.jpg" alt="0190m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0190.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo!&rsquo; shouted the shameless Jingle, &lsquo;anybody damaged?&mdash;elderly
      gentlemen&mdash;no light weights&mdash;dangerous work&mdash;very.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a rascal,&rsquo; roared Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! ha!&rsquo; replied Jingle; and then he added, with a knowing wink, and a
      jerk of the thumb towards the interior of the chaise&mdash;&lsquo;I say&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      very well&mdash;desires her compliments&mdash;begs you won&rsquo;t trouble
      yourself&mdash;love to <i>Tuppy</i>&mdash;won&rsquo;t you get up behind?&mdash;drive
      on, boys.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The postillions resumed their proper attitudes, and away rattled the
      chaise, Mr. Jingle fluttering in derision a white handkerchief from the
      coach window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in the whole adventure, not even the upset, had disturbed the calm
      and equable current of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s temper. The villainy, however, which
      could first borrow money of his faithful follower, and then abbreviate his
      name to &lsquo;Tuppy,&rsquo; was more than he could patiently bear. He drew his breath
      hard, and coloured up to the very tips of his spectacles, as he said,
      slowly and emphatically&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If ever I meet that man again, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; interrupted Wardle, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s all very well; but while we stand
      talking here, they&rsquo;ll get their licence, and be married in London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick paused, bottled up his vengeance, and corked it down. &lsquo;How
      far is it to the next stage?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Wardle, of one of the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Six mile, ain&rsquo;t it, Tom?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rayther better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rayther better nor six mile, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t be helped,&rsquo; said Wardle, &lsquo;we must walk it, Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No help for it,&rsquo; replied that truly great man.
    </p>
    <p>
      So sending forward one of the boys on horseback, to procure a fresh chaise
      and horses, and leaving the other behind to take care of the broken one,
      Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Wardle set manfully forward on the walk, first tying
      their shawls round their necks, and slouching down their hats to escape as
      much as possible from the deluge of rain, which after a slight cessation
      had again begun to pour heavily down.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. CLEARING UP ALL DOUBTS (IF ANY EXISTED) OF THE
      DISINTERESTEDNESS OF MR. A. JINGLE&rsquo;S CHARACTER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here are in London
      several old inns, once the headquarters of celebrated coaches in the days
      when coaches performed their journeys in a graver and more solemn manner
      than they do in these times; but which have now degenerated into little
      more than the abiding and booking-places of country wagons. The reader
      would look in vain for any of these ancient hostelries, among the Golden
      Crosses and Bull and Mouths, which rear their stately fronts in the
      improved streets of London. If he would light upon any of these old
      places, he must direct his steps to the obscurer quarters of the town, and
      there in some secluded nooks he will find several, still standing with a
      kind of gloomy sturdiness, amidst the modern innovations which surround
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Borough especially, there still remain some half-dozen old inns,
      which have preserved their external features unchanged, and which have
      escaped alike the rage for public improvement and the encroachments of
      private speculation. Great, rambling queer old places they are, with
      galleries, and passages, and staircases, wide enough and antiquated enough
      to furnish materials for a hundred ghost stories, supposing we should ever
      be reduced to the lamentable necessity of inventing any, and that the
      world should exist long enough to exhaust the innumerable veracious
      legends connected with old London Bridge, and its adjacent neighbourhood
      on the Surrey side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the yard of one of these inns&mdash;of no less celebrated a one
      than the White Hart&mdash;that a man was busily employed in brushing the
      dirt off a pair of boots, early on the morning succeeding the events
      narrated in the last chapter. He was habited in a coarse, striped
      waistcoat, with black calico sleeves, and blue glass buttons; drab
      breeches and leggings. A bright red handkerchief was wound in a very loose
      and unstudied style round his neck, and an old white hat was carelessly
      thrown on one side of his head. There were two rows of boots before him,
      one cleaned and the other dirty, and at every addition he made to the
      clean row, he paused from his work, and contemplated its results with
      evident satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yard presented none of that bustle and activity which are the usual
      characteristics of a large coach inn. Three or four lumbering wagons, each
      with a pile of goods beneath its ample canopy, about the height of the
      second-floor window of an ordinary house, were stowed away beneath a lofty
      roof which extended over one end of the yard; and another, which was
      probably to commence its journey that morning, was drawn out into the open
      space. A double tier of bedroom galleries, with old clumsy balustrades,
      ran round two sides of the straggling area, and a double row of bells to
      correspond, sheltered from the weather by a little sloping roof, hung over
      the door leading to the bar and coffee-room. Two or three gigs and
      chaise-carts were wheeled up under different little sheds and pent-houses;
      and the occasional heavy tread of a cart-horse, or rattling of a chain at
      the farther end of the yard, announced to anybody who cared about the
      matter, that the stable lay in that direction. When we add that a few boys
      in smock-frocks were lying asleep on heavy packages, wool-packs, and other
      articles that were scattered about on heaps of straw, we have described as
      fully as need be the general appearance of the yard of the White Hart Inn,
      High Street, Borough, on the particular morning in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud ringing of one of the bells was followed by the appearance of a
      smart chambermaid in the upper sleeping gallery, who, after tapping at one
      of the doors, and receiving a request from within, called over the
      balustrades&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo,&rsquo; replied the man with the white hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Number twenty-two wants his boots.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ask number twenty-two, vether he&rsquo;ll have &lsquo;em now, or vait till he gets
      &lsquo;em,&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, don&rsquo;t be a fool, Sam,&rsquo; said the girl coaxingly, &lsquo;the gentleman
      wants his boots directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you <i>are</i> a nice young &lsquo;ooman for a musical party, you are,&rsquo; 
      said the boot-cleaner. &lsquo;Look at these here boots&mdash;eleven pair o&rsquo; 
      boots; and one shoe as belongs to number six, with the wooden leg. The
      eleven boots is to be called at half-past eight and the shoe at nine.
      Who&rsquo;s number twenty-two, that&rsquo;s to put all the others out? No, no; reg&rsquo;lar
      rotation, as Jack Ketch said, ven he tied the men up. Sorry to keep you
      a-waitin&rsquo;, Sir, but I&rsquo;ll attend to you directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Saying which, the man in the white hat set to work upon a top-boot with
      increased assiduity.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another loud ring; and the bustling old landlady of the White
      Hart made her appearance in the opposite gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; cried the landlady, &lsquo;where&rsquo;s that lazy, idle&mdash;why, Sam&mdash;oh,
      there you are; why don&rsquo;t you answer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vouldn&rsquo;t be gen-teel to answer, till you&rsquo;d done talking,&rsquo; replied Sam
      gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, clean these shoes for number seventeen directly, and take &lsquo;em to
      private sitting-room, number five, first floor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady flung a pair of lady&rsquo;s shoes into the yard, and bustled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Number five,&rsquo; said Sam, as he picked up the shoes, and taking a piece of
      chalk from his pocket, made a memorandum of their destination on the soles&mdash;&lsquo;Lady&rsquo;s
      shoes and private sittin&rsquo;-room! I suppose she didn&rsquo;t come in the vagin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She came in early this morning,&rsquo; cried the girl, who was still leaning
      over the railing of the gallery, &lsquo;with a gentleman in a hackney-coach, and
      it&rsquo;s him as wants his boots, and you&rsquo;d better do &lsquo;em, that&rsquo;s all about
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vy didn&rsquo;t you say so before,&rsquo; said Sam, with great indignation, singling
      out the boots in question from the heap before him. &lsquo;For all I know&rsquo;d he
      was one o&rsquo; the regular threepennies. Private room! and a lady too! If he&rsquo;s
      anything of a gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, he&rsquo;s vurth a shillin&rsquo; a day, let alone the
      arrands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Stimulated by this inspiring reflection, Mr. Samuel brushed away with such
      hearty good-will, that in a few minutes the boots and shoes, with a polish
      which would have struck envy to the soul of the amiable Mr. Warren (for
      they used Day &amp; Martin at the White Hart), had arrived at the door of
      number five.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; said a man&rsquo;s voice, in reply to Sam&rsquo;s rap at the door. Sam made
      his best bow, and stepped into the presence of a lady and gentleman seated
      at breakfast. Having officiously deposited the gentleman&rsquo;s boots right and
      left at his feet, and the lady&rsquo;s shoes right and left at hers, he backed
      towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Boots,&rsquo; said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Sam, closing the door, and keeping his hand on the knob of the
      lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know&mdash;what&rsquo;s a-name&mdash;Doctors&rsquo; Commons?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, Sir; low archway on the carriage side, bookseller&rsquo;s at
      one corner, hotel on the other, and two porters in the middle as touts for
      licences.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Touts for licences!&rsquo; said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Touts for licences,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;Two coves in vhite aprons&mdash;touches
      their hats ven you walk in&mdash;&ldquo;Licence, Sir, licence?&rdquo; Queer sort,
      them, and their mas&rsquo;rs, too, sir&mdash;Old Bailey Proctors&mdash;and no
      mistake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do they do?&rsquo; inquired the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do! You, Sir! That ain&rsquo;t the worst on it, neither. They puts things into
      old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n&rsquo;s heads as they never dreamed of. My father, Sir, wos a
      coachman. A widower he wos, and fat enough for anything&mdash;uncommon
      fat, to be sure. His missus dies, and leaves him four hundred pound. Down
      he goes to the Commons, to see the lawyer and draw the blunt&mdash;very
      smart&mdash;top boots on&mdash;nosegay in his button-hole&mdash;broad-brimmed
      tile&mdash;green shawl&mdash;quite the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n. Goes through the
      archvay, thinking how he should inwest the money&mdash;up comes the
      touter, touches his hat&mdash;&ldquo;Licence, Sir, licence?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      that?&rdquo; says my father.&mdash;&ldquo;Licence, Sir,&rdquo; says he.&mdash;&ldquo;What
      licence?&rdquo; says my father.&mdash;&ldquo;Marriage licence,&rdquo; says the touter.&mdash;&ldquo;Dash
      my veskit,&rdquo; says my father, &ldquo;I never thought o&rsquo; that.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I think you
      wants one, Sir,&rdquo; says the touter. My father pulls up, and thinks a bit&mdash;&ldquo;No,&rdquo;
       says he, &ldquo;damme, I&rsquo;m too old, b&rsquo;sides, I&rsquo;m a many sizes too large,&rdquo; says
      he.&mdash;&ldquo;Not a bit on it, Sir,&rdquo; says the touter.&mdash;&ldquo;Think not?&rdquo; says
      my father.&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure not,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;we married a gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n twice
      your size, last Monday.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Did you, though?&rdquo; said my father.&mdash;&ldquo;To
      be sure, we did,&rdquo; says the touter, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a babby to him&mdash;this way,
      sir&mdash;this way!&rdquo;&mdash;and sure enough my father walks arter him, like
      a tame monkey behind a horgan, into a little back office, vere a teller
      sat among dirty papers, and tin boxes, making believe he was busy. &ldquo;Pray
      take a seat, vile I makes out the affidavit, Sir,&rdquo; says the lawyer.&mdash;&ldquo;Thank&rsquo;ee,
      Sir,&rdquo; says my father, and down he sat, and stared with all his eyes, and
      his mouth vide open, at the names on the boxes. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, Sir,&rdquo;
       says the lawyer.&mdash;&ldquo;Tony Weller,&rdquo; says my father.&mdash;&ldquo;Parish?&rdquo; says
      the lawyer. &ldquo;Belle Savage,&rdquo; says my father; for he stopped there wen he
      drove up, and he know&rsquo;d nothing about parishes, he didn&rsquo;t.&mdash;&ldquo;And
      what&rsquo;s the lady&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; says the lawyer. My father was struck all of a
      heap. &ldquo;Blessed if I know,&rdquo; says he.&mdash;&ldquo;Not know!&rdquo; says the lawyer.&mdash;&ldquo;No
      more nor you do,&rdquo; says my father; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t I put that in arterwards?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;
       says the lawyer.&mdash;&ldquo;Wery well,&rdquo; says my father, after he&rsquo;d thought a
      moment, &ldquo;put down Mrs. Clarke.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What Clarke?&rdquo; says the lawyer,
      dipping his pen in the ink.&mdash;&ldquo;Susan Clarke, Markis o&rsquo; Granby,
      Dorking,&rdquo; says my father; &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll have me, if I ask. I des-say&mdash;I
      never said nothing to her, but she&rsquo;ll have me, I know.&rdquo; The licence was
      made out, and she <i>did</i> have him, and what&rsquo;s more she&rsquo;s got him now;
      and I never had any of the four hundred pound, worse luck. Beg your
      pardon, sir,&rsquo; said Sam, when he had concluded, &lsquo;but wen I gets on this
      here grievance, I runs on like a new barrow with the wheel greased.&rsquo; 
      Having said which, and having paused for an instant to see whether he was
      wanted for anything more, Sam left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Half-past nine&mdash;just the time&mdash;off at once;&rsquo; said the
      gentleman, whom we need hardly introduce as Mr. Jingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Time&mdash;for what?&rsquo; said the spinster aunt coquettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Licence, dearest of angels&mdash;give notice at the church&mdash;call you
      mine, to-morrow&rsquo;&mdash;said Mr. Jingle, and he squeezed the spinster
      aunt&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The licence!&rsquo; said Rachael, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The licence,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Jingle&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;In hurry, post-haste for a licence,
     In hurry, ding dong I come back.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How you run on,&rsquo; said Rachael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Run on&mdash;nothing to the hours, days, weeks, months, years, when we&rsquo;re
      united&mdash;run on&mdash;they&rsquo;ll fly on&mdash;bolt&mdash;mizzle&mdash;steam-engine&mdash;thousand-horse
      power&mdash;nothing to it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t&mdash;can&rsquo;t we be married before to-morrow morning?&rsquo; inquired
      Rachael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible&mdash;can&rsquo;t be&mdash;notice at the church&mdash;leave the
      licence to-day&mdash;ceremony come off to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am so terrified, lest my brother should discover us!&rsquo; said Rachael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Discover&mdash;nonsense&mdash;too much shaken by the break-down&mdash;besides&mdash;extreme
      caution&mdash;gave up the post-chaise&mdash;walked on&mdash;took a
      hackney-coach&mdash;came to the Borough&mdash;last place in the world that
      he&rsquo;d look in&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;capital notion that&mdash;very.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be long,&rsquo; said the spinster affectionately, as Mr. Jingle stuck the
      pinched-up hat on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Long away from you?&mdash;Cruel charmer,&rsquo; and Mr. Jingle skipped
      playfully up to the spinster aunt, imprinted a chaste kiss upon her lips,
      and danced out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear man!&rsquo; said the spinster, as the door closed after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rum old girl,&rsquo; said Mr. Jingle, as he walked down the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is painful to reflect upon the perfidy of our species; and we will not,
      therefore, pursue the thread of Mr. Jingle&rsquo;s meditations, as he wended his
      way to Doctors&rsquo; Commons. It will be sufficient for our purpose to relate,
      that escaping the snares of the dragons in white aprons, who guard the
      entrance to that enchanted region, he reached the vicar-general&rsquo;s office
      in safety and having procured a highly flattering address on parchment,
      from the Archbishop of Canterbury, to his &lsquo;trusty and well-beloved Alfred
      Jingle and Rachael Wardle, greeting,&rsquo; he carefully deposited the mystic
      document in his pocket, and retraced his steps in triumph to the Borough.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was yet on his way to the White Hart, when two plump gentleman and one
      thin one entered the yard, and looked round in search of some authorised
      person of whom they could make a few inquiries. Mr. Samuel Weller happened
      to be at that moment engaged in burnishing a pair of painted tops, the
      personal property of a farmer who was refreshing himself with a slight
      lunch of two or three pounds of cold beef and a pot or two of porter,
      after the fatigues of the Borough market; and to him the thin gentleman
      straightway advanced.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0200.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friend,&rsquo; said the thin gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re one o&rsquo; the adwice gratis order,&rsquo; thought Sam, &lsquo;or you wouldn&rsquo;t be
      so wery fond o&rsquo; me all at once.&rsquo; But he only said&mdash;&lsquo;Well, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friend,&rsquo; said the thin gentleman, with a conciliatory hem&mdash;&lsquo;have
      you got many people stopping here now? Pretty busy. Eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam stole a look at the inquirer. He was a little high-dried man, with a
      dark squeezed-up face, and small, restless, black eyes, that kept winking
      and twinkling on each side of his little inquisitive nose, as if they were
      playing a perpetual game of peep-bo with that feature. He was dressed all
      in black, with boots as shiny as his eyes, a low white neckcloth, and a
      clean shirt with a frill to it. A gold watch-chain, and seals, depended
      from his fob. He carried his black kid gloves <i>in</i> his hands, and not
      ON them; and as he spoke, thrust his wrists beneath his coat tails, with
      the air of a man who was in the habit of propounding some regular posers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty busy, eh?&rsquo; said the little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, wery well, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam, &lsquo;we shan&rsquo;t be bankrupts, and we shan&rsquo;t
      make our fort&rsquo;ns. We eats our biled mutton without capers, and don&rsquo;t care
      for horse-radish ven ve can get beef.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the little man, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a wag, ain&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My eldest brother was troubled with that complaint,&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;it may be
      catching&mdash;I used to sleep with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is a curious old house of yours,&rsquo; said the little man, looking round
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you&rsquo;d sent word you was a-coming, we&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; had it repaired;&rsquo; replied
      the imperturbable Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man seemed rather baffled by these several repulses, and a
      short consultation took place between him and the two plump gentlemen. At
      its conclusion, the little man took a pinch of snuff from an oblong silver
      box, and was apparently on the point of renewing the conversation, when
      one of the plump gentlemen, who in addition to a benevolent countenance,
      possessed a pair of spectacles, and a pair of black gaiters, interfered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fact of the matter is,&rsquo; said the benevolent gentleman, &lsquo;that my
      friend here (pointing to the other plump gentleman) will give you half a
      guinea, if you&rsquo;ll answer one or two&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, my dear sir&mdash;my dear Sir,&rsquo; said the little man, &lsquo;pray, allow me&mdash;my
      dear Sir, the very first principle to be observed in these cases, is this:
      if you place the matter in the hands of a professional man, you must in no
      way interfere in the progress of the business; you must repose implicit
      confidence in him. Really, Mr.&mdash;&rsquo; He turned to the other plump
      gentleman, and said, &lsquo;I forget your friend&rsquo;s name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pickwick,&rsquo; said Mr. Wardle, for it was no other than that jolly
      personage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Pickwick&mdash;really Mr. Pickwick, my dear Sir, excuse me&mdash;I
      shall be happy to receive any private suggestions of yours, as AMICUS
      CURIAE, but you must see the impropriety of your interfering with my
      conduct in this case, with such an AD CAPTANDUM argument as the offer of
      half a guinea. Really, my dear Sir, really;&rsquo; and the little man took an
      argumentative pinch of snuff, and looked very profound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My only wish, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;was to bring this very unpleasant
      matter to as speedy a close as possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite right&mdash;quite right,&rsquo; said the little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With which view,&rsquo; continued Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I made use of the argument
      which my experience of men has taught me is the most likely to succeed in
      any case.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, ay,&rsquo; said the little man, &lsquo;very good, very good, indeed; but you
      should have suggested it to me. My dear sir, I&rsquo;m quite certain you cannot
      be ignorant of the extent of confidence which must be placed in
      professional men. If any authority can be necessary on such a point, my
      dear sir, let me refer you to the well-known case in Barnwell and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind George Barnwell,&rsquo; interrupted Sam, who had remained a
      wondering listener during this short colloquy; &lsquo;everybody knows what sort
      of a case his was, tho&rsquo; it&rsquo;s always been my opinion, mind you, that the
      young &lsquo;ooman deserved scragging a precious sight more than he did.
      Hows&rsquo;ever, that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. You want me to accept of half a
      guinea. Wery well, I&rsquo;m agreeable: I can&rsquo;t say no fairer than that, can I,
      sir?&rsquo; (Mr. Pickwick smiled.) Then the next question is, what the devil do
      you want with me, as the man said, wen he see the ghost?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We want to know&mdash;&rsquo; said Mr. Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, my dear sir&mdash;my dear sir,&rsquo; interposed the busy little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wardle shrugged his shoulders, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We want to know,&rsquo; said the little man solemnly; &lsquo;and we ask the question
      of you, in order that we may not awaken apprehensions inside&mdash;we want
      to know who you&rsquo;ve got in this house at present?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who there is in the house!&rsquo; said Sam, in whose mind the inmates were
      always represented by that particular article of their costume, which came
      under his immediate superintendence. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a vooden leg in number six;
      there&rsquo;s a pair of Hessians in thirteen; there&rsquo;s two pair of halves in the
      commercial; there&rsquo;s these here painted tops in the snuggery inside the
      bar; and five more tops in the coffee-room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing more?&rsquo; said the little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop a bit,&rsquo; replied Sam, suddenly recollecting himself. &lsquo;Yes; there&rsquo;s a
      pair of Vellingtons a good deal worn, and a pair o&rsquo; lady&rsquo;s shoes, in
      number five.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What sort of shoes?&rsquo; hastily inquired Wardle, who, together with Mr.
      Pickwick, had been lost in bewilderment at the singular catalogue of
      visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Country make,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any maker&rsquo;s name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brown.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where of?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Muggleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is them,&rsquo; exclaimed Wardle. &lsquo;By heavens, we&rsquo;ve found them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;The Vellingtons has gone to Doctors&rsquo; Commons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, for a licence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;re in time,&rsquo; exclaimed Wardle. &lsquo;Show us the room; not a moment is to
      be lost.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, my dear sir&mdash;pray,&rsquo; said the little man; &lsquo;caution, caution.&rsquo; 
      He drew from his pocket a red silk purse, and looked very hard at Sam as
      he drew out a sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam grinned expressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Show us into the room at once, without announcing us,&rsquo; said the little
      man, &lsquo;and it&rsquo;s yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam threw the painted tops into a corner, and led the way through a dark
      passage, and up a wide staircase. He paused at the end of a second
      passage, and held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here it is,&rsquo; whispered the attorney, as he deposited the money on the
      hand of their guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man stepped forward for a few paces, followed by the two friends and
      their legal adviser. He stopped at a door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this the room?&rsquo; murmured the little gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Wardle opened the door; and the whole three walked into the room just
      as Mr. Jingle, who had that moment returned, had produced the licence to
      the spinster aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spinster uttered a loud shriek, and throwing herself into a chair,
      covered her face with her hands. Mr. Jingle crumpled up the licence, and
      thrust it into his coat pocket. The unwelcome visitors advanced into the
      middle of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&mdash;you are a nice rascal, arn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; exclaimed Wardle, breathless
      with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Sir, my dear sir,&rsquo; said the little man, laying his hat on the
      table, &lsquo;pray, consider&mdash;pray. Defamation of character: action for
      damages. Calm yourself, my dear sir, pray&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How dare you drag my sister from my house?&rsquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ay&mdash;ay&mdash;very good,&rsquo; said the little gentleman, &lsquo;you may ask
      that. How dare you, sir?&mdash;eh, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who the devil are you?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Jingle, in so fierce a tone, that
      the little gentleman involuntarily fell back a step or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is he, you scoundrel,&rsquo; interposed Wardle. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s my lawyer, Mr.
      Perker, of Gray&rsquo;s Inn. Perker, I&rsquo;ll have this fellow prosecuted&mdash;indicted&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      ruin him. And you,&rsquo; continued Mr. Wardle, turning abruptly round to his
      sister&mdash;&lsquo;you, Rachael, at a time of life when you ought to know
      better, what do you mean by running away with a vagabond, disgracing your
      family, and making yourself miserable? Get on your bonnet and come back.
      Call a hackney-coach there, directly, and bring this lady&rsquo;s bill, d&rsquo;ye
      hear&mdash;d&rsquo;ye hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cert&rsquo;nly, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam, who had answered Wardle&rsquo;s violent ringing of
      the bell with a degree of celerity which must have appeared marvellous to
      anybody who didn&rsquo;t know that his eye had been applied to the outside of
      the keyhole during the whole interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get on your bonnet,&rsquo; repeated Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do nothing of the kind,&rsquo; said Jingle. &lsquo;Leave the room, Sir&mdash;no
      business here&mdash;lady&rsquo;s free to act as she pleases&mdash;more than
      one-and-twenty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More than one-and-twenty!&rsquo; ejaculated Wardle contemptuously. &lsquo;More than
      one-and-forty!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the spinster aunt, her indignation getting the better of
      her determination to faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are,&rsquo; replied Wardle; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re fifty if you&rsquo;re an hour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the spinster aunt uttered a loud shriek, and became senseless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A glass of water,&rsquo; said the humane Mr. Pickwick, summoning the landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A glass of water!&rsquo; said the passionate Wardle. &lsquo;Bring a bucket, and throw
      it all over her; it&rsquo;ll do her good, and she richly deserves it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ugh, you brute!&rsquo; ejaculated the kind-hearted landlady. &lsquo;Poor dear.&rsquo; And
      with sundry ejaculations of &lsquo;Come now, there&rsquo;s a dear&mdash;drink a little
      of this&mdash;it&rsquo;ll do you good&mdash;don&rsquo;t give way so&mdash;there&rsquo;s a
      love,&rsquo; etc. etc., the landlady, assisted by a chambermaid, proceeded to
      vinegar the forehead, beat the hands, titillate the nose, and unlace the
      stays of the spinster aunt, and to administer such other restoratives as
      are usually applied by compassionate females to ladies who are
      endeavouring to ferment themselves into hysterics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Coach is ready, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam, appearing at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come along,&rsquo; cried Wardle. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll carry her downstairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this proposition, the hysterics came on with redoubled violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady was about to enter a very violent protest against this
      proceeding, and had already given vent to an indignant inquiry whether Mr.
      Wardle considered himself a lord of the creation, when Mr. Jingle
      interposed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Boots,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;get me an officer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay, stay,&rsquo; said little Mr. Perker. &lsquo;Consider, Sir, consider.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not consider,&rsquo; replied Jingle. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s her own mistress&mdash;see who
      dares to take her away&mdash;unless she wishes it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> be taken away,&rsquo; murmured the spinster aunt. &lsquo;I <i>don&rsquo;t</i>
      wish it.&rsquo; (Here there was a frightful relapse.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Sir,&rsquo; said the little man, in a low tone, taking Mr. Wardle and
      Mr. Pickwick apart&mdash;&lsquo;my dear Sir, we&rsquo;re in a very awkward situation.
      It&rsquo;s a distressing case&mdash;very; I never knew one more so; but really,
      my dear sir, really we have no power to control this lady&rsquo;s actions. I
      warned you before we came, my dear sir, that there was nothing to look to
      but a compromise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What kind of compromise would you recommend?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, my dear Sir, our friend&rsquo;s in an unpleasant position&mdash;very much
      so. We must be content to suffer some pecuniary loss.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll suffer any, rather than submit to this disgrace, and let her, fool
      as she is, be made miserable for life,&rsquo; said Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I rather think it can be done,&rsquo; said the bustling little man. &lsquo;Mr.
      Jingle, will you step with us into the next room for a moment?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jingle assented, and the quartette walked into an empty apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, sir,&rsquo; said the little man, as he carefully closed the door, &lsquo;is
      there no way of accommodating this matter&mdash;step this way, sir, for a
      moment&mdash;into this window, Sir, where we can be alone&mdash;there,
      sir, there, pray sit down, sir. Now, my dear Sir, between you and I, we
      know very well, my dear Sir, that you have run off with this lady for the
      sake of her money. Don&rsquo;t frown, Sir, don&rsquo;t frown; I say, between you and
      I, <i>we</i> know it. We are both men of the world, and WE know very well
      that our friends here, are not&mdash;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jingle&rsquo;s face gradually relaxed; and something distantly resembling a
      wink quivered for an instant in his left eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good, very good,&rsquo; said the little man, observing the impression he
      had made. &lsquo;Now, the fact is, that beyond a few hundreds, the lady has
      little or nothing till the death of her mother&mdash;fine old lady, my
      dear Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Old</i>,&rsquo; said Mr. Jingle briefly but emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, yes,&rsquo; said the attorney, with a slight cough. &lsquo;You are right, my
      dear Sir, she is rather old. She comes of an old family though, my dear
      Sir; old in every sense of the word. The founder of that family came into
      Kent when Julius Caesar invaded Britain;&mdash;only one member of it,
      since, who hasn&rsquo;t lived to eighty-five, and he was beheaded by one of the
      Henrys. The old lady is not seventy-three now, my dear Sir.&rsquo; The little
      man paused, and took a pinch of snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; cried Mr. Jingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, my dear sir&mdash;you don&rsquo;t take snuff!&mdash;ah! so much the
      better&mdash;expensive habit&mdash;well, my dear Sir, you&rsquo;re a fine young
      man, man of the world&mdash;able to push your fortune, if you had capital,
      eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Jingle again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you comprehend me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not quite.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think&mdash;now, my dear Sir, I put it to you don&rsquo;t you think&mdash;that
      fifty pounds and liberty would be better than Miss Wardle and
      expectation?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t do&mdash;not half enough!&rsquo; said Mr. Jingle, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, nay, my dear Sir,&rsquo; remonstrated the little attorney, seizing him by
      the button. &lsquo;Good round sum&mdash;a man like you could treble it in no
      time&mdash;great deal to be done with fifty pounds, my dear Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More to be done with a hundred and fifty,&rsquo; replied Mr. Jingle coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, my dear Sir, we won&rsquo;t waste time in splitting straws,&rsquo; resumed the
      little man, &lsquo;say&mdash;say&mdash;seventy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Won&rsquo;t do,&rsquo; said Mr. Jingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go away, my dear sir&mdash;pray don&rsquo;t hurry,&rsquo; said the little man.
      &lsquo;Eighty; come: I&rsquo;ll write you a cheque at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t do,&rsquo; said Mr. Jingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, my dear Sir, well,&rsquo; said the little man, still detaining him; &lsquo;just
      tell me what <i>will</i> do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Expensive affair,&rsquo; said Mr. Jingle. &lsquo;Money out of pocket&mdash;posting,
      nine pounds; licence, three&mdash;that&rsquo;s twelve&mdash;compensation, a
      hundred&mdash;hundred and twelve&mdash;breach of honour&mdash;and loss of
      the lady&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my dear Sir, yes,&rsquo; said the little man, with a knowing look, &lsquo;never
      mind the last two items. That&rsquo;s a hundred and twelve&mdash;say a hundred&mdash;come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And twenty,&rsquo; said Mr. Jingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come, I&rsquo;ll write you a cheque,&rsquo; said the little man; and down he
      sat at the table for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make it payable the day after to-morrow,&rsquo; said the little man, with
      a look towards Mr. Wardle; &lsquo;and we can get the lady away, meanwhile.&rsquo; Mr.
      Wardle sullenly nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A hundred,&rsquo; said the little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And twenty,&rsquo; said Mr. Jingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Sir,&rsquo; remonstrated the little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give it him,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Wardle, &lsquo;and let him go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The cheque was written by the little gentleman, and pocketed by Mr.
      Jingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, leave this house instantly!&rsquo; said Wardle, starting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Sir,&rsquo; urged the little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And mind,&rsquo; said Mr. Wardle, &lsquo;that nothing should have induced me to make
      this compromise&mdash;not even a regard for my family&mdash;if I had not
      known that the moment you got any money in that pocket of yours, you&rsquo;d go
      to the devil faster, if possible, than you would without it&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear sir,&rsquo; urged the little man again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be quiet, Perker,&rsquo; resumed Wardle. &lsquo;Leave the room, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Off directly,&rsquo; said the unabashed Jingle. &lsquo;Bye bye, Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      If any dispassionate spectator could have beheld the countenance of the
      illustrious man, whose name forms the leading feature of the title of this
      work, during the latter part of this conversation, he would have been
      almost induced to wonder that the indignant fire which flashed from his
      eyes did not melt the glasses of his spectacles&mdash;so majestic was his
      wrath. His nostrils dilated, and his fists clenched involuntarily, as he
      heard himself addressed by the villain. But he restrained himself again&mdash;he
      did not pulverise him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; continued the hardened traitor, tossing the licence at Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s feet; &lsquo;get the name altered&mdash;take home the lady&mdash;do
      for Tuppy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was a philosopher, but philosophers are only men in armour,
      after all. The shaft had reached him, penetrated through his philosophical
      harness, to his very heart. In the frenzy of his rage, he hurled the
      inkstand madly forward, and followed it up himself. But Mr. Jingle had
      disappeared, and he found himself caught in the arms of Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo,&rsquo; said that eccentric functionary, &lsquo;furniter&rsquo;s cheap where you come
      from, Sir. Self-acting ink, that &lsquo;ere; it&rsquo;s wrote your mark upon the wall,
      old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n. Hold still, Sir; wot&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; runnin&rsquo; arter a man as
      has made his lucky, and got to t&rsquo;other end of the Borough by this time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s mind, like those of all truly great men, was open to
      conviction. He was a quick and powerful reasoner; and a moment&rsquo;s
      reflection sufficed to remind him of the impotency of his rage. It
      subsided as quickly as it had been roused. He panted for breath, and
      looked benignantly round upon his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall we tell the lamentations that ensued when Miss Wardle found herself
      deserted by the faithless Jingle? Shall we extract Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s masterly
      description of that heartrending scene? His note-book, blotted with the
      tears of sympathising humanity, lies open before us; one word, and it is
      in the printer&rsquo;s hands. But, no! we will be resolute! We will not wring
      the public bosom, with the delineation of such suffering!
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and sadly did the two friends and the deserted lady return next day
      in the Muggleton heavy coach. Dimly and darkly had the sombre shadows of a
      summer&rsquo;s night fallen upon all around, when they again reached Dingley
      Dell, and stood within the entrance to Manor Farm.

      CHAPTER XI. INVOLVING ANOTHER JOURNEY, AND AN ANTIQUARIAN DISCOVERY;
      RECORDING MR. PICKWICK&rsquo;S DETERMINATION TO BE PRESENT AT AN ELECTION; AND
      CONTAINING A MANUSCRIPT OF THE OLD CLERGYMAN&rsquo;S
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> night of quiet
      and repose in the profound silence of Dingley Dell, and an hour&rsquo;s
      breathing of its fresh and fragrant air on the ensuing morning, completely
      recovered Mr. Pickwick from the effects of his late fatigue of body and
      anxiety of mind. That illustrious man had been separated from his friends
      and followers for two whole days; and it was with a degree of pleasure and
      delight, which no common imagination can adequately conceive, that he
      stepped forward to greet Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass, as he encountered
      those gentlemen on his return from his early walk. The pleasure was
      mutual; for who could ever gaze on Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s beaming face without
      experiencing the sensation? But still a cloud seemed to hang over his
      companions which that great man could not but be sensible of, and was
      wholly at a loss to account for. There was a mysterious air about them
      both, as unusual as it was alarming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, when he had grasped his followers by the
      hand, and exchanged warm salutations of welcome&mdash;&lsquo;how is Tupman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle, to whom the question was more peculiarly addressed, made no
      reply. He turned away his head, and appeared absorbed in melancholy
      reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Snodgrass,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick earnestly, &lsquo;how is our friend&mdash;he is
      not ill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Mr. Snodgrass; and a tear trembled on his sentimental
      eyelid, like a rain-drop on a window-frame&mdash;&lsquo;no; he is not ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick stopped, and gazed on each of his friends in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Winkle&mdash;Snodgrass,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;what does this mean? Where
      is our friend? What has happened? Speak&mdash;I conjure, I entreat&mdash;nay,
      I command you, speak.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a solemnity&mdash;a dignity&mdash;in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s manner, not
      to be withstood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is gone,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gone!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Gone!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gone,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where!&rsquo; ejaculated Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can only guess, from that communication,&rsquo; replied Mr. Snodgrass,
      taking a letter from his pocket, and placing it in his friend&rsquo;s hand.
      &lsquo;Yesterday morning, when a letter was received from Mr. Wardle, stating
      that you would be home with his sister at night, the melancholy which had
      hung over our friend during the whole of the previous day, was observed to
      increase. He shortly afterwards disappeared: he was missing during the
      whole day, and in the evening this letter was brought by the hostler from
      the Crown, at Muggleton. It had been left in his charge in the morning,
      with a strict injunction that it should not be delivered until night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick opened the epistle. It was in his friend&rsquo;s hand-writing, and
      these were its contents:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MY DEAR PICKWICK,&mdash;<i>You</i>, my dear friend, are placed far beyond
      the reach of many mortal frailties and weaknesses which ordinary people
      cannot overcome. You do not know what it is, at one blow, to be deserted
      by a lovely and fascinating creature, and to fall a victim to the
      artifices of a villain, who had the grin of cunning beneath the mask of
      friendship. I hope you never may.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any letter addressed to me at the Leather Bottle, Cobham, Kent, will be
      forwarded&mdash;supposing I still exist. I hasten from the sight of that
      world, which has become odious to me. Should I hasten from it altogether,
      pity&mdash;forgive me. Life, my dear Pickwick, has become insupportable to
      me. The spirit which burns within us, is a porter&rsquo;s knot, on which to rest
      the heavy load of worldly cares and troubles; and when that spirit fails
      us, the burden is too heavy to be borne. We sink beneath it. You may tell
      Rachael&mdash;Ah, that name!&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                        &lsquo;TRACY TUPMAN.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must leave this place directly,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as he refolded the
      note. &lsquo;It would not have been decent for us to remain here, under any
      circumstances, after what has happened; and now we are bound to follow in
      search of our friend.&rsquo; And so saying, he led the way to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      His intention was rapidly communicated. The entreaties to remain were
      pressing, but Mr. Pickwick was inflexible. Business, he said, required his
      immediate attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old clergyman was present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not really going?&rsquo; said he, taking Mr. Pickwick aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick reiterated his former determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then here,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, &lsquo;is a little manuscript, which I had
      hoped to have the pleasure of reading to you myself. I found it on the
      death of a friend of mine&mdash;a medical man, engaged in our county
      lunatic asylum&mdash;among a variety of papers, which I had the option of
      destroying or preserving, as I thought proper. I can hardly believe that
      the manuscript is genuine, though it certainly is not in my friend&rsquo;s hand.
      However, whether it be the genuine production of a maniac, or founded upon
      the ravings of some unhappy being (which I think more probable), read it,
      and judge for yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick received the manuscript, and parted from the benevolent old
      gentleman with many expressions of good-will and esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a more difficult task to take leave of the inmates of Manor Farm,
      from whom they had received so much hospitality and kindness. Mr. Pickwick
      kissed the young ladies&mdash;we were going to say, as if they were his
      own daughters, only, as he might possibly have infused a little more
      warmth into the salutation, the comparison would not be quite appropriate&mdash;hugged
      the old lady with filial cordiality; and patted the rosy cheeks of the
      female servants in a most patriarchal manner, as he slipped into the hands
      of each some more substantial expression of his approval. The exchange of
      cordialities with their fine old host and Mr. Trundle was even more hearty
      and prolonged; and it was not until Mr. Snodgrass had been several times
      called for, and at last emerged from a dark passage followed soon after by
      Emily (whose bright eyes looked unusually dim), that the three friends
      were enabled to tear themselves from their friendly entertainers. Many a
      backward look they gave at the farm, as they walked slowly away; and many
      a kiss did Mr. Snodgrass waft in the air, in acknowledgment of something
      very like a lady&rsquo;s handkerchief, which was waved from one of the upper
      windows, until a turn of the lane hid the old house from their sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Muggleton they procured a conveyance to Rochester. By the time they
      reached the last-named place, the violence of their grief had sufficiently
      abated to admit of their making a very excellent early dinner; and having
      procured the necessary information relative to the road, the three friends
      set forward again in the afternoon to walk to Cobham.
    </p>
    <p>
      A delightful walk it was; for it was a pleasant afternoon in June, and
      their way lay through a deep and shady wood, cooled by the light wind
      which gently rustled the thick foliage, and enlivened by the songs of the
      birds that perched upon the boughs. The ivy and the moss crept in thick
      clusters over the old trees, and the soft green turf overspread the ground
      like a silken mat. They emerged upon an open park, with an ancient hall,
      displaying the quaint and picturesque architecture of Elizabeth&rsquo;s time.
      Long vistas of stately oaks and elm trees appeared on every side; large
      herds of deer were cropping the fresh grass; and occasionally a startled
      hare scoured along the ground, with the speed of the shadows thrown by the
      light clouds which swept across a sunny landscape like a passing breath of
      summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If this,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking about him&mdash;&lsquo;if this were the
      place to which all who are troubled with our friend&rsquo;s complaint came, I
      fancy their old attachment to this world would very soon return.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think so too,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And really,&rsquo; added Mr. Pickwick, after half an hour&rsquo;s walking had brought
      them to the village, &lsquo;really, for a misanthrope&rsquo;s choice, this is one of
      the prettiest and most desirable places of residence I ever met with.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this opinion also, both Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass expressed their
      concurrence; and having been directed to the Leather Bottle, a clean and
      commodious village ale-house, the three travellers entered, and at once
      inquired for a gentleman of the name of Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Show the gentlemen into the parlour, Tom,&rsquo; said the landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stout country lad opened a door at the end of the passage, and the three
      friends entered a long, low-roofed room, furnished with a large number of
      high-backed leather-cushioned chairs, of fantastic shapes, and embellished
      with a great variety of old portraits and roughly-coloured prints of some
      antiquity. At the upper end of the room was a table, with a white cloth
      upon it, well covered with a roast fowl, bacon, ale, and et ceteras; and
      at the table sat Mr. Tupman, looking as unlike a man who had taken his
      leave of the world, as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the entrance of his friends, that gentleman laid down his knife and
      fork, and with a mournful air advanced to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not expect to see you here,&rsquo; he said, as he grasped Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      hand. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, sitting down, and wiping from his forehead the
      perspiration which the walk had engendered. &lsquo;Finish your dinner, and walk
      out with me. I wish to speak to you alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman did as he was desired; and Mr. Pickwick having refreshed
      himself with a copious draught of ale, waited his friend&rsquo;s leisure. The
      dinner was quickly despatched, and they walked out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      For half an hour, their forms might have been seen pacing the churchyard
      to and fro, while Mr. Pickwick was engaged in combating his companion&rsquo;s
      resolution. Any repetition of his arguments would be useless; for what
      language could convey to them that energy and force which their great
      originator&rsquo;s manner communicated? Whether Mr. Tupman was already tired of
      retirement, or whether he was wholly unable to resist the eloquent appeal
      which was made to him, matters not, he did <i>not </i> resist it at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It mattered little to him,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;where he dragged out the miserable
      remainder of his days; and since his friend laid so much stress upon his
      humble companionship, he was willing to share his adventures.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick smiled; they shook hands, and walked back to rejoin their
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment that Mr. Pickwick made that immortal discovery,
      which has been the pride and boast of his friends, and the envy of every
      antiquarian in this or any other country. They had passed the door of
      their inn, and walked a little way down the village, before they
      recollected the precise spot in which it stood. As they turned back, Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s eye fell upon a small broken stone, partially buried in the
      ground, in front of a cottage door. He paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is very strange,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is strange?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Tupman, staring eagerly at every object
      near him, but the right one. &lsquo;God bless me, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This last was an ejaculation of irrepressible astonishment, occasioned by
      seeing Mr. Pickwick, in his enthusiasm for discovery, fall on his knees
      before the little stone, and commence wiping the dust off it with his
      pocket-handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is an inscription here,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it possible?&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can discern,&rsquo; continued Mr. Pickwick, rubbing away with all his might,
      and gazing intently through his spectacles&mdash;&lsquo;I can discern a cross,
      and a 13, and then a T. This is important,&rsquo; continued Mr. Pickwick,
      starting up. &lsquo;This is some very old inscription, existing perhaps long
      before the ancient alms-houses in this place. It must not be lost.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He tapped at the cottage door. A labouring man opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know how this stone came here, my friend?&rsquo; inquired the benevolent
      Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I doan&rsquo;t, Sir,&rsquo; replied the man civilly. &lsquo;It was here long afore I
      was born, or any on us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick glanced triumphantly at his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;are not particularly attached to it, I dare say,&rsquo; 
      said Mr. Pickwick, trembling with anxiety. &lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t mind selling it,
      now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! but who&rsquo;d buy it?&rsquo; inquired the man, with an expression of face which
      he probably meant to be very cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you ten shillings for it, at once,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;if you
      would take it up for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The astonishment of the village may be easily imagined, when (the little
      stone having been raised with one wrench of a spade) Mr. Pickwick, by dint
      of great personal exertion, bore it with his own hands to the inn, and
      after having carefully washed it, deposited it on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exultation and joy of the Pickwickians knew no bounds, when their
      patience and assiduity, their washing and scraping, were crowned with
      success. The stone was uneven and broken, and the letters were straggling
      and irregular, but the following fragment of an inscription was clearly to
      be deciphered:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          [cross]  B I L S T
                     U M

                    S. M.
                    ARK
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with delight, as he sat and gloated over the
      treasure he had discovered. He had attained one of the greatest objects of
      his ambition. In a county known to abound in the remains of the early
      ages; in a village in which there still existed some memorials of the
      olden time, he&mdash;he, the chairman of the Pickwick Club&mdash;had
      discovered a strange and curious inscription of unquestionable antiquity,
      which had wholly escaped the observation of the many learned men who had
      preceded him. He could hardly trust the evidence of his senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This&mdash;this,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;determines me. We return to town to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow!&rsquo; exclaimed his admiring followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;This treasure must be at once deposited
      where it can be thoroughly investigated and properly understood. I have
      another reason for this step. In a few days, an election is to take place
      for the borough of Eatanswill, at which Mr. Perker, a gentleman whom I
      lately met, is the agent of one of the candidates. We will behold, and
      minutely examine, a scene so interesting to every Englishman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will,&rsquo; was the animated cry of three voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick looked round him. The attachment and fervour of his followers
      lighted up a glow of enthusiasm within him. He was their leader, and he
      felt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us celebrate this happy meeting with a convivial glass,&rsquo; said he.
      This proposition, like the other, was received with unanimous applause.
      Having himself deposited the important stone in a small deal box,
      purchased from the landlady for the purpose, he placed himself in an
      arm-chair, at the head of the table; and the evening was devoted to
      festivity and conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was past eleven o&rsquo;clock&mdash;a late hour for the little village of
      Cobham&mdash;when Mr. Pickwick retired to the bedroom which had been
      prepared for his reception. He threw open the lattice window, and setting
      his light upon the table, fell into a train of meditation on the hurried
      events of the two preceding days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour and the place were both favourable to contemplation; Mr. Pickwick
      was roused by the church clock striking twelve. The first stroke of the
      hour sounded solemnly in his ear, but when the bell ceased the stillness
      seemed insupportable&mdash;he almost felt as if he had lost a companion.
      He was nervous and excited; and hastily undressing himself and placing his
      light in the chimney, got into bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one has experienced that disagreeable state of mind, in which a
      sensation of bodily weariness in vain contends against an inability to
      sleep. It was Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s condition at this moment: he tossed first on
      one side and then on the other; and perseveringly closed his eyes as if to
      coax himself to slumber. It was of no use. Whether it was the unwonted
      exertion he had undergone, or the heat, or the brandy-and-water, or the
      strange bed&mdash;whatever it was, his thoughts kept reverting very
      uncomfortably to the grim pictures downstairs, and the old stories to
      which they had given rise in the course of the evening. After half an
      hour&rsquo;s tumbling about, he came to the unsatisfactory conclusion, that it
      was of no use trying to sleep; so he got up and partially dressed himself.
      Anything, he thought, was better than lying there fancying all kinds of
      horrors. He looked out of the window&mdash;it was very dark. He walked
      about the room&mdash;it was very lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken a few turns from the door to the window, and from the window
      to the door, when the clergyman&rsquo;s manuscript for the first time entered
      his head. It was a good thought. If it failed to interest him, it might
      send him to sleep. He took it from his coat pocket, and drawing a small
      table towards his bedside, trimmed the light, put on his spectacles, and
      composed himself to read. It was a strange handwriting, and the paper was
      much soiled and blotted. The title gave him a sudden start, too; and he
      could not avoid casting a wistful glance round the room. Reflecting on the
      absurdity of giving way to such feelings, however, he trimmed the light
      again, and read as follows:&mdash;
    </p>

  A MADMAN&rsquo;S MANUSCRIPT
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes!&mdash;a madman&rsquo;s! How that word would have struck to my heart, many
      years ago! How it would have roused the terror that used to come upon me
      sometimes, sending the blood hissing and tingling through my veins, till
      the cold dew of fear stood in large drops upon my skin, and my knees
      knocked together with fright! I like it now though. It&rsquo;s a fine name. Show
      me the monarch whose angry frown was ever feared like the glare of a
      madman&rsquo;s eye&mdash;whose cord and axe were ever half so sure as a madman&rsquo;s
      gripe. Ho! ho! It&rsquo;s a grand thing to be mad! to be peeped at like a wild
      lion through the iron bars&mdash;to gnash one&rsquo;s teeth and howl, through
      the long still night, to the merry ring of a heavy chain and to roll and
      twine among the straw, transported with such brave music. Hurrah for the
      madhouse! Oh, it&rsquo;s a rare place!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I remember days when I was afraid of being mad; when I used to start from
      my sleep, and fall upon my knees, and pray to be spared from the curse of
      my race; when I rushed from the sight of merriment or happiness, to hide
      myself in some lonely place, and spend the weary hours in watching the
      progress of the fever that was to consume my brain. I knew that madness
      was mixed up with my very blood, and the marrow of my bones! that one
      generation had passed away without the pestilence appearing among them,
      and that I was the first in whom it would revive. I knew it must be so:
      that so it always had been, and so it ever would be: and when I cowered in
      some obscure corner of a crowded room, and saw men whisper, and point, and
      turn their eyes towards me, I knew they were telling each other of the
      doomed madman; and I slunk away again to mope in solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did this for years; long, long years they were. The nights here are
      long sometimes&mdash;very long; but they are nothing to the restless
      nights, and dreadful dreams I had at that time. It makes me cold to
      remember them. Large dusky forms with sly and jeering faces crouched in
      the corners of the room, and bent over my bed at night, tempting me to
      madness. They told me in low whispers, that the floor of the old house in
      which my father died, was stained with his own blood, shed by his own hand
      in raging madness. I drove my fingers into my ears, but they screamed into
      my head till the room rang with it, that in one generation before him the
      madness slumbered, but that his grandfather had lived for years with his
      hands fettered to the ground, to prevent his tearing himself to pieces. I
      knew they told the truth&mdash;I knew it well. I had found it out years
      before, though they had tried to keep it from me. Ha! ha! I was too
      cunning for them, madman as they thought me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At last it came upon me, and I wondered how I could ever have feared it.
      I could go into the world now, and laugh and shout with the best among
      them. I knew I was mad, but they did not even suspect it. How I used to
      hug myself with delight, when I thought of the fine trick I was playing
      them after their old pointing and leering, when I was not mad, but only
      dreading that I might one day become so! And how I used to laugh for joy,
      when I was alone, and thought how well I kept my secret, and how quickly
      my kind friends would have fallen from me, if they had known the truth. I
      could have screamed with ecstasy when I dined alone with some fine roaring
      fellow, to think how pale he would have turned, and how fast he would have
      run, if he had known that the dear friend who sat close to him, sharpening
      a bright, glittering knife, was a madman with all the power, and half the
      will, to plunge it in his heart. Oh, it was a merry life!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Riches became mine, wealth poured in upon me, and I rioted in pleasures
      enhanced a thousandfold to me by the consciousness of my well-kept secret.
      I inherited an estate. The law&mdash;the eagle-eyed law itself&mdash;had
      been deceived, and had handed over disputed thousands to a madman&rsquo;s hands.
      Where was the wit of the sharp-sighted men of sound mind? Where the
      dexterity of the lawyers, eager to discover a flaw? The madman&rsquo;s cunning
      had overreached them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had money. How I was courted! I spent it profusely. How I was praised!
      How those three proud, overbearing brothers humbled themselves before me!
      The old, white-headed father, too&mdash;such deference&mdash;such respect&mdash;such
      devoted friendship&mdash;he worshipped me! The old man had a daughter, and
      the young men a sister; and all the five were poor. I was rich; and when I
      married the girl, I saw a smile of triumph play upon the faces of her
      needy relatives, as they thought of their well-planned scheme, and their
      fine prize. It was for me to smile. To smile! To laugh outright, and tear
      my hair, and roll upon the ground with shrieks of merriment. They little
      thought they had married her to a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay. If they had known it, would they have saved her? A sister&rsquo;s
      happiness against her husband&rsquo;s gold. The lightest feather I blow into the
      air, against the gay chain that ornaments my body!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In one thing I was deceived with all my cunning. If I had not been mad&mdash;for
      though we madmen are sharp-witted enough, we get bewildered sometimes&mdash;I
      should have known that the girl would rather have been placed, stiff and
      cold in a dull leaden coffin, than borne an envied bride to my rich,
      glittering house. I should have known that her heart was with the
      dark-eyed boy whose name I once heard her breathe in her troubled sleep;
      and that she had been sacrificed to me, to relieve the poverty of the old,
      white-headed man and the haughty brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t remember forms or faces now, but I know the girl was beautiful. I
      know she was; for in the bright moonlight nights, when I start up from my
      sleep, and all is quiet about me, I see, standing still and motionless in
      one corner of this cell, a slight and wasted figure with long black hair,
      which, streaming down her back, stirs with no earthly wind, and eyes that
      fix their gaze on me, and never wink or close. Hush! the blood chills at
      my heart as I write it down&mdash;that form is <i>her&rsquo;s</i>; the face is
      very pale, and the eyes are glassy bright; but I know them well. That
      figure never moves; it never frowns and mouths as others do, that fill
      this place sometimes; but it is much more dreadful to me, even than the
      spirits that tempted me many years ago&mdash;it comes fresh from the
      grave; and is so very death-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For nearly a year I saw that face grow paler; for nearly a year I saw the
      tears steal down the mournful cheeks, and never knew the cause. I found it
      out at last though. They could not keep it from me long. She had never
      liked me; I had never thought she did: she despised my wealth, and hated
      the splendour in which she lived; but I had not expected that. She loved
      another. This I had never thought of. Strange feelings came over me, and
      thoughts, forced upon me by some secret power, whirled round and round my
      brain. I did not hate her, though I hated the boy she still wept for. I
      pitied&mdash;yes, I pitied&mdash;the wretched life to which her cold and
      selfish relations had doomed her. I knew that she could not live long; but
      the thought that before her death she might give birth to some ill-fated
      being, destined to hand down madness to its offspring, determined me. I
      resolved to kill her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For many weeks I thought of poison, and then of drowning, and then of
      fire. A fine sight, the grand house in flames, and the madman&rsquo;s wife
      smouldering away to cinders. Think of the jest of a large reward, too, and
      of some sane man swinging in the wind for a deed he never did, and all
      through a madman&rsquo;s cunning! I thought often of this, but I gave it up at
      last. Oh! the pleasure of stropping the razor day after day, feeling the
      sharp edge, and thinking of the gash one stroke of its thin, bright edge
      would make!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At last the old spirits who had been with me so often before whispered in
      my ear that the time was come, and thrust the open razor into my hand. I
      grasped it firmly, rose softly from the bed, and leaned over my sleeping
      wife. Her face was buried in her hands. I withdrew them softly, and they
      fell listlessly on her bosom. She had been weeping; for the traces of the
      tears were still wet upon her cheek. Her face was calm and placid; and
      even as I looked upon it, a tranquil smile lighted up her pale features. I
      laid my hand softly on her shoulder. She started&mdash;it was only a
      passing dream. I leaned forward again. She screamed, and woke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One motion of my hand, and she would never again have uttered cry or
      sound. But I was startled, and drew back. Her eyes were fixed on mine. I
      knew not how it was, but they cowed and frightened me; and I quailed
      beneath them. She rose from the bed, still gazing fixedly and steadily on
      me. I trembled; the razor was in my hand, but I could not move. She made
      towards the door. As she neared it, she turned, and withdrew her eyes from
      my face. The spell was broken. I bounded forward, and clutched her by the
      arm. Uttering shriek upon shriek, she sank upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I could have killed her without a struggle; but the house was
      alarmed. I heard the tread of footsteps on the stairs. I replaced the
      razor in its usual drawer, unfastened the door, and called loudly for
      assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They came, and raised her, and placed her on the bed. She lay bereft of
      animation for hours; and when life, look, and speech returned, her senses
      had deserted her, and she raved wildly and furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Doctors were called in&mdash;great men who rolled up to my door in easy
      carriages, with fine horses and gaudy servants. They were at her bedside
      for weeks. They had a great meeting and consulted together in low and
      solemn voices in another room. One, the cleverest and most celebrated
      among them, took me aside, and bidding me prepare for the worst, told me&mdash;me,
      the madman!&mdash;that my wife was mad. He stood close beside me at an
      open window, his eyes looking in my face, and his hand laid upon my arm.
      With one effort, I could have hurled him into the street beneath. It would
      have been rare sport to have done it; but my secret was at stake, and I
      let him go. A few days after, they told me I must place her under some
      restraint: I must provide a keeper for her. I! I went into the open fields
      where none could hear me, and laughed till the air resounded with my
      shouts!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She died next day. The white-headed old man followed her to the grave,
      and the proud brothers dropped a tear over the insensible corpse of her
      whose sufferings they had regarded in her lifetime with muscles of iron.
      All this was food for my secret mirth, and I laughed behind the white
      handkerchief which I held up to my face, as we rode home, till the tears
      came into my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But though I had carried my object and killed her, I was restless and
      disturbed, and I felt that before long my secret must be known. I could
      not hide the wild mirth and joy which boiled within me, and made me when I
      was alone, at home, jump up and beat my hands together, and dance round
      and round, and roar aloud. When I went out, and saw the busy crowds
      hurrying about the streets; or to the theatre, and heard the sound of
      music, and beheld the people dancing, I felt such glee, that I could have
      rushed among them, and torn them to pieces limb from limb, and howled in
      transport. But I ground my teeth, and struck my feet upon the floor, and
      drove my sharp nails into my hands. I kept it down; and no one knew I was
      a madman yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I remember&mdash;though it&rsquo;s one of the last things I can remember: for
      now I mix up realities with my dreams, and having so much to do, and being
      always hurried here, have no time to separate the two, from some strange
      confusion in which they get involved&mdash;I remember how I let it out at
      last. Ha! ha! I think I see their frightened looks now, and feel the ease
      with which I flung them from me, and dashed my clenched fist into their
      white faces, and then flew like the wind, and left them screaming and
      shouting far behind. The strength of a giant comes upon me when I think of
      it. There&mdash;see how this iron bar bends beneath my furious wrench. I
      could snap it like a twig, only there are long galleries here with many
      doors&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I could find my way along them; and even if I
      could, I know there are iron gates below which they keep locked and
      barred. They know what a clever madman I have been, and they are proud to
      have me here, to show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me see: yes, I had been out. It was late at night when I reached
      home, and found the proudest of the three proud brothers waiting to see me&mdash;urgent
      business he said: I recollect it well. I hated that man with all a
      madman&rsquo;s hate. Many and many a time had my fingers longed to tear him.
      They told me he was there. I ran swiftly upstairs. He had a word to say to
      me. I dismissed the servants. It was late, and we were alone together&mdash;for
      the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I kept my eyes carefully from him at first, for I knew what he little
      thought&mdash;and I gloried in the knowledge&mdash;that the light of
      madness gleamed from them like fire. We sat in silence for a few minutes.
      He spoke at last. My recent dissipation, and strange remarks, made so soon
      after his sister&rsquo;s death, were an insult to her memory. Coupling together
      many circumstances which had at first escaped his observation, he thought
      I had not treated her well. He wished to know whether he was right in
      inferring that I meant to cast a reproach upon her memory, and a
      disrespect upon her family. It was due to the uniform he wore, to demand
      this explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This man had a commission in the army&mdash;a commission, purchased with
      my money, and his sister&rsquo;s misery! This was the man who had been foremost
      in the plot to ensnare me, and grasp my wealth. This was the man who had
      been the main instrument in forcing his sister to wed me; well knowing
      that her heart was given to that puling boy. Due to his uniform! The
      livery of his degradation! I turned my eyes upon him&mdash;I could not
      help it&mdash;but I spoke not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw the sudden change that came upon him beneath my gaze. He was a bold
      man, but the colour faded from his face, and he drew back his chair. I
      dragged mine nearer to him; and I laughed&mdash;I was very merry then&mdash;I
      saw him shudder. I felt the madness rising within me. He was afraid of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You were very fond of your sister when she was alive,&rdquo; I said.&mdash;&ldquo;Very.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He looked uneasily round him, and I saw his hand grasp the back of his
      chair; but he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You villain,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I found you out: I discovered your hellish plots
      against me; I know her heart was fixed on some one else before you
      compelled her to marry me. I know it&mdash;I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He jumped suddenly from his chair, brandished it aloft, and bid me stand
      back&mdash;for I took care to be getting closer to him all the time I
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I screamed rather than talked, for I felt tumultuous passions eddying
      through my veins, and the old spirits whispering and taunting me to tear
      his heart out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Damn you,&rdquo; said I, starting up, and rushing upon him; &ldquo;I killed her. I
      am a madman. Down with you. Blood, blood! I will have it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I turned aside with one blow the chair he hurled at me in his terror, and
      closed with him; and with a heavy crash we rolled upon the floor together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was a fine struggle that; for he was a tall, strong man, fighting for
      his life; and I, a powerful madman, thirsting to destroy him. I knew no
      strength could equal mine, and I was right. Right again, though a madman!
      His struggles grew fainter. I knelt upon his chest, and clasped his brawny
      throat firmly with both hands. His face grew purple; his eyes were
      starting from his head, and with protruded tongue, he seemed to mock me. I
      squeezed the tighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The door was suddenly burst open with a loud noise, and a crowd of people
      rushed forward, crying aloud to each other to secure the madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My secret was out; and my only struggle now was for liberty and freedom.
      I gained my feet before a hand was on me, threw myself among my
      assailants, and cleared my way with my strong arm, as if I bore a hatchet
      in my hand, and hewed them down before me. I gained the door, dropped over
      the banisters, and in an instant was in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Straight and swift I ran, and no one dared to stop me. I heard the noise
      of the feet behind, and redoubled my speed. It grew fainter and fainter in
      the distance, and at length died away altogether; but on I bounded,
      through marsh and rivulet, over fence and wall, with a wild shout which
      was taken up by the strange beings that flocked around me on every side,
      and swelled the sound, till it pierced the air. I was borne upon the arms
      of demons who swept along upon the wind, and bore down bank and hedge
      before them, and spun me round and round with a rustle and a speed that
      made my head swim, until at last they threw me from them with a violent
      shock, and I fell heavily upon the earth. When I woke I found myself here&mdash;here
      in this gray cell, where the sunlight seldom comes, and the moon steals
      in, in rays which only serve to show the dark shadows about me, and that
      silent figure in its old corner. When I lie awake, I can sometimes hear
      strange shrieks and cries from distant parts of this large place. What
      they are, I know not; but they neither come from that pale form, nor does
      it regard them. For from the first shades of dusk till the earliest light
      of morning, it still stands motionless in the same place, listening to the
      music of my iron chain, and watching my gambols on my straw bed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the manuscript was written, in another hand, this note:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [The unhappy man whose ravings are recorded above, was a melancholy
      instance of the baneful results of energies misdirected in early life, and
      excesses prolonged until their consequences could never be repaired. The
      thoughtless riot, dissipation, and debauchery of his younger days produced
      fever and delirium. The first effects of the latter was the strange
      delusion, founded upon a well-known medical theory, strongly contended for
      by some, and as strongly contested by others, that an hereditary madness
      existed in his family. This produced a settled gloom, which in time
      developed a morbid insanity, and finally terminated in raving madness.
      There is every reason to believe that the events he detailed, though
      distorted in the description by his diseased imagination, really happened.
      It is only matter of wonder to those who were acquainted with the vices of
      his early career, that his passions, when no longer controlled by reason,
      did not lead him to the commission of still more frightful deeds.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s candle was just expiring in the socket, as he concluded the
      perusal of the old clergyman&rsquo;s manuscript; and when the light went
      suddenly out, without any previous flicker by way of warning, it
      communicated a very considerable start to his excited frame. Hastily
      throwing off such articles of clothing as he had put on when he rose from
      his uneasy bed, and casting a fearful glance around, he once more
      scrambled hastily between the sheets, and soon fell fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was shining brilliantly into his chamber, when he awoke, and the
      morning was far advanced. The gloom which had oppressed him on the
      previous night had disappeared with the dark shadows which shrouded the
      landscape, and his thoughts and feelings were as light and gay as the
      morning itself. After a hearty breakfast, the four gentlemen sallied forth
      to walk to Gravesend, followed by a man bearing the stone in its deal box.
      They reached the town about one o&rsquo;clock (their luggage they had directed
      to be forwarded to the city, from Rochester), and being fortunate enough
      to secure places on the outside of a coach, arrived in London in sound
      health and spirits, on that same afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next three or four days were occupied with the preparations which were
      necessary for their journey to the borough of Eatanswill. As any
      references to that most important undertaking demands a separate chapter,
      we may devote the few lines which remain at the close of this, to narrate,
      with great brevity, the history of the antiquarian discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears from the Transactions of the Club, then, that Mr. Pickwick
      lectured upon the discovery at a General Club Meeting, convened on the
      night succeeding their return, and entered into a variety of ingenious and
      erudite speculations on the meaning of the inscription. It also appears
      that a skilful artist executed a faithful delineation of the curiosity,
      which was engraven on stone, and presented to the Royal Antiquarian
      Society, and other learned bodies: that heart-burnings and jealousies
      without number were created by rival controversies which were penned upon
      the subject; and that Mr. Pickwick himself wrote a pamphlet, containing
      ninety-six pages of very small print, and twenty-seven different readings
      of the inscription: that three old gentlemen cut off their eldest sons
      with a shilling a-piece for presuming to doubt the antiquity of the
      fragment; and that one enthusiastic individual cut himself off
      prematurely, in despair at being unable to fathom its meaning: that Mr.
      Pickwick was elected an honorary member of seventeen native and foreign
      societies, for making the discovery: that none of the seventeen could make
      anything of it; but that all the seventeen agreed it was very
      extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blotton, indeed&mdash;and the name will be doomed to the undying
      contempt of those who cultivate the mysterious and the sublime&mdash;Mr.
      Blotton, we say, with the doubt and cavilling peculiar to vulgar minds,
      presumed to state a view of the case, as degrading as ridiculous. Mr.
      Blotton, with a mean desire to tarnish the lustre of the immortal name of
      Pickwick, actually undertook a journey to Cobham in person, and on his
      return, sarcastically observed in an oration at the club, that he had seen
      the man from whom the stone was purchased; that the man presumed the stone
      to be ancient, but solemnly denied the antiquity of the inscription&mdash;inasmuch
      as he represented it to have been rudely carved by himself in an idle
      mood, and to display letters intended to bear neither more or less than
      the simple construction of&mdash;&lsquo;BILL STUMPS, HIS MARK&rsquo;; and that Mr.
      Stumps, being little in the habit of original composition, and more
      accustomed to be guided by the sound of words than by the strict rules of
      orthography, had omitted the concluding &lsquo;L&rsquo; of his Christian name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pickwick Club (as might have been expected from so enlightened an
      institution) received this statement with the contempt it deserved,
      expelled the presumptuous and ill-conditioned Blotton from the society,
      and voted Mr. Pickwick a pair of gold spectacles, in token of their
      confidence and approbation: in return for which, Mr. Pickwick caused a
      portrait of himself to be painted, and hung up in the club room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blotton was ejected but not conquered. He also wrote a pamphlet,
      addressed to the seventeen learned societies, native and foreign,
      containing a repetition of the statement he had already made, and rather
      more than half intimating his opinion that the seventeen learned societies
      were so many &lsquo;humbugs.&rsquo; Hereupon, the virtuous indignation of the
      seventeen learned societies being roused, several fresh pamphlets
      appeared; the foreign learned societies corresponded with the native
      learned societies; the native learned societies translated the pamphlets
      of the foreign learned societies into English; the foreign learned
      societies translated the pamphlets of the native learned societies into
      all sorts of languages; and thus commenced that celebrated scientific
      discussion so well known to all men, as the Pickwick controversy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this base attempt to injure Mr. Pickwick recoiled upon the head of its
      calumnious author. The seventeen learned societies unanimously voted the
      presumptuous Blotton an ignorant meddler, and forthwith set to work upon
      more treatises than ever. And to this day the stone remains, an illegible
      monument of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s greatness, and a lasting trophy to the
      littleness of his enemies.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. DESCRIPTIVE OF A VERY IMPORTANT PROCEEDING ON THE PART OF MR.
      PICKWICK; NO LESS AN EPOCH IN HIS LIFE, THAN IN THIS HISTORY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      apartments in Goswell Street, although on a limited scale, were not only
      of a very neat and comfortable description, but peculiarly adapted for the
      residence of a man of his genius and observation. His sitting-room was the
      first-floor front, his bedroom the second-floor front; and thus, whether
      he were sitting at his desk in his parlour, or standing before the
      dressing-glass in his dormitory, he had an equal opportunity of
      contemplating human nature in all the numerous phases it exhibits, in that
      not more populous than popular thoroughfare. His landlady, Mrs. Bardell&mdash;the
      relict and sole executrix of a deceased custom-house officer&mdash;was a
      comely woman of bustling manners and agreeable appearance, with a natural
      genius for cooking, improved by study and long practice, into an exquisite
      talent. There were no children, no servants, no fowls. The only other
      inmates of the house were a large man and a small boy; the first a lodger,
      the second a production of Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s. The large man was always home
      precisely at ten o&rsquo;clock at night, at which hour he regularly condensed
      himself into the limits of a dwarfish French bedstead in the back parlour;
      and the infantine sports and gymnastic exercises of Master Bardell were
      exclusively confined to the neighbouring pavements and gutters.
      Cleanliness and quiet reigned throughout the house; and in it Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s will was law.
    </p>
    <p>
      To any one acquainted with these points of the domestic economy of the
      establishment, and conversant with the admirable regulation of Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s mind, his appearance and behaviour on the morning previous to
      that which had been fixed upon for the journey to Eatanswill would have
      been most mysterious and unaccountable. He paced the room to and fro with
      hurried steps, popped his head out of the window at intervals of about
      three minutes each, constantly referred to his watch, and exhibited many
      other manifestations of impatience very unusual with him. It was evident
      that something of great importance was in contemplation, but what that
      something was, not even Mrs. Bardell had been enabled to discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Bardell,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, at last, as that amiable female
      approached the termination of a prolonged dusting of the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your little boy is a very long time gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why it&rsquo;s a good long way to the Borough, sir,&rsquo; remonstrated Mrs. Bardell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;very true; so it is.&rsquo; Mr. Pickwick relapsed into
      silence, and Mrs. Bardell resumed her dusting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Bardell,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, at the expiration of a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think it a much greater expense to keep two people, than to keep
      one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;La, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell, colouring up to the very border of
      her cap, as she fancied she observed a species of matrimonial twinkle in
      the eyes of her lodger; &lsquo;La, Mr. Pickwick, what a question!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, but do you?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That depends,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell, approaching the duster very near to Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s elbow which was planted on the table. &lsquo;That depends a good deal
      upon the person, you know, Mr. Pickwick; and whether it&rsquo;s a saving and
      careful person, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s very true,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;but the person I have in my eye
      (here he looked very hard at Mrs. Bardell) I think possesses these
      qualities; and has, moreover, a considerable knowledge of the world, and a
      great deal of sharpness, Mrs. Bardell, which may be of material use to
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;La, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell, the crimson rising to her
      cap-border again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, growing energetic, as was his wont in speaking
      of a subject which interested him&mdash;&lsquo;I do, indeed; and to tell you the
      truth, Mrs. Bardell, I have made up my mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, sir,&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Bardell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll think it very strange now,&rsquo; said the amiable Mr. Pickwick, with a
      good-humoured glance at his companion, &lsquo;that I never consulted you about
      this matter, and never even mentioned it, till I sent your little boy out
      this morning&mdash;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bardell could only reply by a look. She had long worshipped Mr.
      Pickwick at a distance, but here she was, all at once, raised to a
      pinnacle to which her wildest and most extravagant hopes had never dared
      to aspire. Mr. Pickwick was going to propose&mdash;a deliberate plan, too&mdash;sent
      her little boy to the Borough, to get him out of the way&mdash;how
      thoughtful&mdash;how considerate!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;what do you think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell, trembling with agitation, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re
      very kind, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll save you a good deal of trouble, won&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I never thought anything of the trouble, sir,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Bardell;
      &lsquo;and, of course, I should take more trouble to please you then, than ever;
      but it is so kind of you, Mr. Pickwick, to have so much consideration for
      my loneliness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, to be sure,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;I never thought of that. When I am
      in town, you&rsquo;ll always have somebody to sit with you. To be sure, so you
      will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure I ought to be a very happy woman,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And your little boy&mdash;&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless his heart!&rsquo; interposed Mrs. Bardell, with a maternal sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He, too, will have a companion,&rsquo; resumed Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;a lively one,
      who&rsquo;ll teach him, I&rsquo;ll be bound, more tricks in a week than he would ever
      learn in a year.&rsquo; And Mr. Pickwick smiled placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you dear&mdash;&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you kind, good, playful dear,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell; and without more
      ado, she rose from her chair, and flung her arms round Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      neck, with a cataract of tears and a chorus of sobs.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/0238m.jpg" alt="0238m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0238.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless my soul,&rsquo; cried the astonished Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;Mrs. Bardell, my good
      woman&mdash;dear me, what a situation&mdash;pray consider.&mdash;Mrs.
      Bardell, don&rsquo;t&mdash;if anybody should come&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, let them come,&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Bardell frantically; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never leave
      you&mdash;dear, kind, good soul;&rsquo; and, with these words, Mrs. Bardell
      clung the tighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mercy upon me,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, struggling violently, &lsquo;I hear somebody
      coming up the stairs. Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s a good creature, don&rsquo;t.&rsquo; But
      entreaty and remonstrance were alike unavailing; for Mrs. Bardell had
      fainted in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s arms; and before he could gain time to deposit
      her on a chair, Master Bardell entered the room, ushering in Mr. Tupman,
      Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was struck motionless and speechless. He stood with his
      lovely burden in his arms, gazing vacantly on the countenances of his
      friends, without the slightest attempt at recognition or explanation.
      They, in their turn, stared at him; and Master Bardell, in his turn,
      stared at everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      The astonishment of the Pickwickians was so absorbing, and the perplexity
      of Mr. Pickwick was so extreme, that they might have remained in exactly
      the same relative situations until the suspended animation of the lady was
      restored, had it not been for a most beautiful and touching expression of
      filial affection on the part of her youthful son. Clad in a tight suit of
      corduroy, spangled with brass buttons of a very considerable size, he at
      first stood at the door astounded and uncertain; but by degrees, the
      impression that his mother must have suffered some personal damage
      pervaded his partially developed mind, and considering Mr. Pickwick as the
      aggressor, he set up an appalling and semi-earthly kind of howling, and
      butting forward with his head, commenced assailing that immortal gentleman
      about the back and legs, with such blows and pinches as the strength of
      his arm, and the violence of his excitement, allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take this little villain away,&rsquo; said the agonised Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s
      mad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; said the three tongue-tied Pickwickians.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick pettishly. &lsquo;Take away the boy.&rsquo; (Here
      Mr. Winkle carried the interesting boy, screaming and struggling, to the
      farther end of the apartment.) &lsquo;Now help me, lead this woman downstairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I am better now,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me lead you downstairs,&rsquo; said the ever-gallant Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, sir&mdash;thank you;&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Bardell hysterically. And
      downstairs she was led accordingly, accompanied by her affectionate son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot conceive,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick when his friend returned&mdash;&lsquo;I
      cannot conceive what has been the matter with that woman. I had merely
      announced to her my intention of keeping a man-servant, when she fell into
      the extraordinary paroxysm in which you found her. Very extraordinary
      thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very,&rsquo; said his three friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Placed me in such an extremely awkward situation,&rsquo; continued Mr.
      Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very,&rsquo; was the reply of his followers, as they coughed slightly, and
      looked dubiously at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      This behaviour was not lost upon Mr. Pickwick. He remarked their
      incredulity. They evidently suspected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a man in the passage now,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the man I spoke to you about,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;I sent for him to
      the Borough this morning. Have the goodness to call him up, Snodgrass.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Snodgrass did as he was desired; and Mr. Samuel Weller forthwith
      presented himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh&mdash;you remember me, I suppose?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think so,&rsquo; replied Sam, with a patronising wink. &lsquo;Queer start
      that &lsquo;ere, but he was one too many for you, warn&rsquo;t he? Up to snuff and a
      pinch or two over&mdash;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind that matter now,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick hastily; &lsquo;I want to speak
      to you about something else. Sit down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, sir,&rsquo; said Sam. And down he sat without further bidding, having
      previously deposited his old white hat on the landing outside the door.
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t a wery good &lsquo;un to look at,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s an astonishin&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;un to wear; and afore the brim went, it was a wery handsome tile.
      Hows&rsquo;ever it&rsquo;s lighter without it, that&rsquo;s one thing, and every hole lets
      in some air, that&rsquo;s another&mdash;wentilation gossamer I calls it.&rsquo; On the
      delivery of this sentiment, Mr. Weller smiled agreeably upon the assembled
      Pickwickians.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now with regard to the matter on which I, with the concurrence of these
      gentlemen, sent for you,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the pint, sir,&rsquo; interposed Sam; &lsquo;out vith it, as the father said
      to his child, when he swallowed a farden.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We want to know, in the first place,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;whether you
      have any reason to be discontented with your present situation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Afore I answers that &lsquo;ere question, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, &lsquo;I
      should like to know, in the first place, whether you&rsquo;re a-goin&rsquo; to purwide
      me with a better?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A sunbeam of placid benevolence played on Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s features as he
      said, &lsquo;I have half made up my mind to engage you myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you, though?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick nodded in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wages?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twelve pounds a year,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clothes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two suits.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Work?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To attend upon me; and travel about with me and these gentlemen here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take the bill down,&rsquo; said Sam emphatically. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m let to a single
      gentleman, and the terms is agreed upon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You accept the situation?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cert&rsquo;nly,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;If the clothes fits me half as well as the
      place, they&rsquo;ll do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can get a character of course?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ask the landlady o&rsquo; the White Hart about that, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you come this evening?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get into the clothes this minute, if they&rsquo;re here,&rsquo; said Sam, with
      great alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Call at eight this evening,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;and if the inquiries are
      satisfactory, they shall be provided.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With the single exception of one amiable indiscretion, in which an
      assistant housemaid had equally participated, the history of Mr. Weller&rsquo;s
      conduct was so very blameless, that Mr. Pickwick felt fully justified in
      closing the engagement that very evening. With the promptness and energy
      which characterised not only the public proceedings, but all the private
      actions of this extraordinary man, he at once led his new attendant to one
      of those convenient emporiums where gentlemen&rsquo;s new and second-hand
      clothes are provided, and the troublesome and inconvenient formality of
      measurement dispensed with; and before night had closed in, Mr. Weller was
      furnished with a grey coat with the P. C. button, a black hat with a
      cockade to it, a pink striped waistcoat, light breeches and gaiters, and a
      variety of other necessaries, too numerous to recapitulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said that suddenly-transformed individual, as he took his seat on
      the outside of the Eatanswill coach next morning; &lsquo;I wonder whether I&rsquo;m
      meant to be a footman, or a groom, or a gamekeeper, or a seedsman. I looks
      like a sort of compo of every one on &lsquo;em. Never mind; there&rsquo;s a change of
      air, plenty to see, and little to do; and all this suits my complaint
      uncommon; so long life to the Pickvicks, says I!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER XIII. SOME ACCOUNT OF EATANSWILL; OF THE STATE OF PARTIES THEREIN;
      AND OF THE ELECTION OF A MEMBER TO SERVE IN PARLIAMENT FOR THAT ANCIENT,
      LOYAL, AND PATRIOTIC BOROUGH
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e will frankly
      acknowledge that, up to the period of our being first immersed in the
      voluminous papers of the Pickwick Club, we had never heard of Eatanswill;
      we will with equal candour admit that we have in vain searched for proof
      of the actual existence of such a place at the present day. Knowing the
      deep reliance to be placed on every note and statement of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s,
      and not presuming to set up our recollection against the recorded
      declarations of that great man, we have consulted every authority, bearing
      upon the subject, to which we could possibly refer. We have traced every
      name in schedules A and B, without meeting with that of Eatanswill; we
      have minutely examined every corner of the pocket county maps issued for
      the benefit of society by our distinguished publishers, and the same
      result has attended our investigation. We are therefore led to believe
      that Mr. Pickwick, with that anxious desire to abstain from giving offence
      to any, and with those delicate feelings for which all who knew him well
      know he was so eminently remarkable, purposely substituted a fictitious
      designation, for the real name of the place in which his observations were
      made. We are confirmed in this belief by a little circumstance, apparently
      slight and trivial in itself, but when considered in this point of view,
      not undeserving of notice. In Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s note-book, we can just trace
      an entry of the fact, that the places of himself and followers were booked
      by the Norwich coach; but this entry was afterwards lined through, as if
      for the purpose of concealing even the direction in which the borough is
      situated. We will not, therefore, hazard a guess upon the subject, but
      will at once proceed with this history, content with the materials which
      its characters have provided for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears, then, that the Eatanswill people, like the people of many
      other small towns, considered themselves of the utmost and most mighty
      importance, and that every man in Eatanswill, conscious of the weight that
      attached to his example, felt himself bound to unite, heart and soul, with
      one of the two great parties that divided the town&mdash;the Blues and the
      Buffs. Now the Blues lost no opportunity of opposing the Buffs, and the
      Buffs lost no opportunity of opposing the Blues; and the consequence was,
      that whenever the Buffs and Blues met together at public meeting,
      town-hall, fair, or market, disputes and high words arose between them.
      With these dissensions it is almost superfluous to say that everything in
      Eatanswill was made a party question. If the Buffs proposed to new
      skylight the market-place, the Blues got up public meetings, and denounced
      the proceeding; if the Blues proposed the erection of an additional pump
      in the High Street, the Buffs rose as one man and stood aghast at the
      enormity. There were Blue shops and Buff shops, Blue inns and Buff inns&mdash;there
      was a Blue aisle and a Buff aisle in the very church itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it was essentially and indispensably necessary that each of
      these powerful parties should have its chosen organ and representative:
      and, accordingly, there were two newspapers in the town&mdash;the
      Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i> and the Eatanswill <i>Independent</i>; the
      former advocating Blue principles, and the latter conducted on grounds
      decidedly Buff. Fine newspapers they were. Such leading articles, and such
      spirited attacks!&mdash;&lsquo;Our worthless contemporary, the <i>Gazette</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;That
      disgraceful and dastardly journal, the <i>Independent</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;That
      false and scurrilous print, the <i>Independent</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;That vile and
      slanderous calumniator, the <i>Gazette</i>;&rsquo; these, and other
      spirit-stirring denunciations, were strewn plentifully over the columns of
      each, in every number, and excited feelings of the most intense delight
      and indignation in the bosoms of the townspeople.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick, with his usual foresight and sagacity, had chosen a
      peculiarly desirable moment for his visit to the borough. Never was such a
      contest known. The Honourable Samuel Slumkey, of Slumkey Hall, was the
      Blue candidate; and Horatio Fizkin, Esq., of Fizkin Lodge, near
      Eatanswill, had been prevailed upon by his friends to stand forward on the
      Buff interest. The <i>Gazette</i> warned the electors of Eatanswill that
      the eyes not only of England, but of the whole civilised world, were upon
      them; and the <i>Independent</i> imperatively demanded to know, whether
      the constituency of Eatanswill were the grand fellows they had always
      taken them for, or base and servile tools, undeserving alike of the name
      of Englishmen and the blessings of freedom. Never had such a commotion
      agitated the town before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the evening when Mr. Pickwick and his companions, assisted
      by Sam, dismounted from the roof of the Eatanswill coach. Large blue silk
      flags were flying from the windows of the Town Arms Inn, and bills were
      posted in every sash, intimating, in gigantic letters, that the Honourable
      Samuel Slumkey&rsquo;s committee sat there daily. A crowd of idlers were
      assembled in the road, looking at a hoarse man in the balcony, who was
      apparently talking himself very red in the face in Mr. Slumkey&rsquo;s behalf;
      but the force and point of whose arguments were somewhat impaired by the
      perpetual beating of four large drums which Mr. Fizkin&rsquo;s committee had
      stationed at the street corner. There was a busy little man beside him,
      though, who took off his hat at intervals and motioned to the people to
      cheer, which they regularly did, most enthusiastically; and as the
      red-faced gentleman went on talking till he was redder in the face than
      ever, it seemed to answer his purpose quite as well as if anybody had
      heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pickwickians had no sooner dismounted than they were surrounded by a
      branch mob of the honest and independent, who forthwith set up three
      deafening cheers, which being responded to by the main body (for it&rsquo;s not
      at all necessary for a crowd to know what they are cheering about),
      swelled into a tremendous roar of triumph, which stopped even the
      red-faced man in the balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hurrah!&rsquo; shouted the mob, in conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One cheer more,&rsquo; screamed the little fugleman in the balcony, and out
      shouted the mob again, as if lungs were cast-iron, with steel works.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Slumkey for ever!&rsquo; roared the honest and independent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Slumkey for ever!&rsquo; echoed Mr. Pickwick, taking off his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No Fizkin!&rsquo; roared the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not!&rsquo; shouted Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Hurrah!&rsquo; And then there was
      another roaring, like that of a whole menagerie when the elephant has rung
      the bell for the cold meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is Slumkey?&rsquo; whispered Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, in the same tone. &lsquo;Hush. Don&rsquo;t ask
      any questions. It&rsquo;s always best on these occasions to do what the mob do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But suppose there are two mobs?&rsquo; suggested Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shout with the largest,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Volumes could not have said more.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the house, the crowd opening right and left to let them pass,
      and cheering vociferously. The first object of consideration was to secure
      quarters for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can we have beds here?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, summoning the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know, Sir,&rsquo; replied the man; &lsquo;afraid we&rsquo;re full, sir&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      inquire, Sir.&rsquo; Away he went for that purpose, and presently returned, to
      ask whether the gentleman were &lsquo;Blue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As neither Mr. Pickwick nor his companions took any vital interest in the
      cause of either candidate, the question was rather a difficult one to
      answer. In this dilemma Mr. Pickwick bethought himself of his new friend,
      Mr. Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know a gentleman of the name of Perker?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, Sir; Honourable Mr. Samuel Slumkey&rsquo;s agent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is Blue, I think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then <i>we</i> are Blue,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; but observing that the man
      looked rather doubtful at this accommodating announcement, he gave him his
      card, and desired him to present it to Mr. Perker forthwith, if he should
      happen to be in the house. The waiter retired; and reappearing almost
      immediately with a request that Mr. Pickwick would follow him, led the way
      to a large room on the first floor, where, seated at a long table covered
      with books and papers, was Mr. Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah&mdash;ah, my dear Sir,&rsquo; said the little man, advancing to meet him;
      &lsquo;very happy to see you, my dear Sir, very. Pray sit down. So you have
      carried your intention into effect. You have come down here to see an
      election&mdash;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick replied in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Spirited contest, my dear sir,&rsquo; said the little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m delighted to hear it,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, rubbing his hands. &lsquo;I like
      to see sturdy patriotism, on whatever side it is called forth&mdash;and so
      it&rsquo;s a spirited contest?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; said the little man, &lsquo;very much so indeed. We have opened all
      the public-houses in the place, and left our adversary nothing but the
      beer-shops&mdash;masterly stroke of policy that, my dear Sir, eh?&rsquo; The
      little man smiled complacently, and took a large pinch of snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what are the probabilities as to the result of the contest?&rsquo; inquired
      Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, doubtful, my dear Sir; rather doubtful as yet,&rsquo; replied the little
      man. &lsquo;Fizkin&rsquo;s people have got three-and-thirty voters in the lock-up
      coach-house at the White Hart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the coach-house!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, considerably astonished by this
      second stroke of policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They keep &lsquo;em locked up there till they want &lsquo;em,&rsquo; resumed the little
      man. &lsquo;The effect of that is, you see, to prevent our getting at them; and
      even if we could, it would be of no use, for they keep them very drunk on
      purpose. Smart fellow Fizkin&rsquo;s agent&mdash;very smart fellow indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick stared, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are pretty confident, though,&rsquo; said Mr. Perker, sinking his voice
      almost to a whisper. &lsquo;We had a little tea-party here, last night&mdash;five-and-forty
      women, my dear sir&mdash;and gave every one of &lsquo;em a green parasol when
      she went away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A parasol!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fact, my dear Sir, fact. Five-and-forty green parasols, at seven and
      sixpence a-piece. All women like finery&mdash;extraordinary the effect of
      those parasols. Secured all their husbands, and half their brothers&mdash;beats
      stockings, and flannel, and all that sort of thing hollow. My idea, my
      dear Sir, entirely. Hail, rain, or sunshine, you can&rsquo;t walk half a dozen
      yards up the street, without encountering half a dozen green parasols.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the little man indulged in a convulsion of mirth, which was only
      checked by the entrance of a third party.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a tall, thin man, with a sandy-coloured head inclined to
      baldness, and a face in which solemn importance was blended with a look of
      unfathomable profundity. He was dressed in a long brown surtout, with a
      black cloth waistcoat, and drab trousers. A double eyeglass dangled at his
      waistcoat; and on his head he wore a very low-crowned hat with a broad
      brim. The new-comer was introduced to Mr. Pickwick as Mr. Pott, the editor
      of the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i>. After a few preliminary remarks, Mr.
      Pott turned round to Mr. Pickwick, and said with solemnity&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This contest excites great interest in the metropolis, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe it does,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To which I have reason to know,&rsquo; said Pott, looking towards Mr. Perker
      for corroboration&mdash;&lsquo;to which I have reason to know that my article of
      last Saturday in some degree contributed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not the least doubt of it,&rsquo; said the little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The press is a mighty engine, sir,&rsquo; said Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick yielded his fullest assent to the proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I trust, sir,&rsquo; said Pott, &lsquo;that I have never abused the enormous
      power I wield. I trust, sir, that I have never pointed the noble
      instrument which is placed in my hands, against the sacred bosom of
      private life, or the tender breast of individual reputation; I trust, sir,
      that I have devoted my energies to&mdash;to endeavours&mdash;humble they
      may be, humble I know they are&mdash;to instil those principles of&mdash;which&mdash;are&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the editor of the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i>, appearing to ramble, Mr.
      Pickwick came to his relief, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what, Sir,&rsquo; said Pott&mdash;&lsquo;what, Sir, let me ask you as an
      impartial man, is the state of the public mind in London, with reference
      to my contest with the <i>Independent</i>?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Greatly excited, no doubt,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Perker, with a look of slyness
      which was very likely accidental.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The contest,&rsquo; said Pott, &lsquo;shall be prolonged so long as I have health and
      strength, and that portion of talent with which I am gifted. From that
      contest, Sir, although it may unsettle men&rsquo;s minds and excite their
      feelings, and render them incapable for the discharge of the everyday
      duties of ordinary life; from that contest, sir, I will never shrink, till
      I have set my heel upon the Eatanswill <i>Independent</i>. I wish the
      people of London, and the people of this country to know, sir, that they
      may rely upon me&mdash;that I will not desert them, that I am resolved to
      stand by them, Sir, to the last.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Your conduct is most noble, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; and he grasped the
      hand of the magnanimous Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are, sir, I perceive, a man of sense and talent,&rsquo; said Mr. Pott,
      almost breathless with the vehemence of his patriotic declaration. &lsquo;I am
      most happy, sir, to make the acquaintance of such a man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;feel deeply honoured by this expression of
      your opinion. Allow me, sir, to introduce you to my fellow-travellers, the
      other corresponding members of the club I am proud to have founded.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be delighted,&rsquo; said Mr. Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick withdrew, and returning with his friends, presented them in
      due form to the editor of the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, my dear Pott,&rsquo; said little Mr. Perker, &lsquo;the question is, what are we
      to do with our friends here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can stop in this house, I suppose,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a spare bed in the house, my dear sir&mdash;not a single bed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Extremely awkward,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very,&rsquo; said his fellow-voyagers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have an idea upon this subject,&rsquo; said Mr. Pott, &lsquo;which I think may be
      very successfully adopted. They have two beds at the Peacock, and I can
      boldly say, on behalf of Mrs. Pott, that she will be delighted to
      accommodate Mr. Pickwick and any one of his friends, if the other two
      gentlemen and their servant do not object to shifting, as they best can,
      at the Peacock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After repeated pressings on the part of Mr. Pott, and repeated
      protestations on that of Mr. Pickwick that he could not think of
      incommoding or troubling his amiable wife, it was decided that it was the
      only feasible arrangement that could be made. So it <i>was </i>made; and
      after dinner together at the Town Arms, the friends separated, Mr. Tupman
      and Mr. Snodgrass repairing to the Peacock, and Mr. Pickwick and Mr.
      Winkle proceeding to the mansion of Mr. Pott; it having been previously
      arranged that they should all reassemble at the Town Arms in the morning,
      and accompany the Honourable Samuel Slumkey&rsquo;s procession to the place of
      nomination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pott&rsquo;s domestic circle was limited to himself and his wife. All men
      whom mighty genius has raised to a proud eminence in the world, have
      usually some little weakness which appears the more conspicuous from the
      contrast it presents to their general character. If Mr. Pott had a
      weakness, it was, perhaps, that he was rather too submissive to the
      somewhat contemptuous control and sway of his wife. We do not feel
      justified in laying any particular stress upon the fact, because on the
      present occasion all Mrs. Pott&rsquo;s most winning ways were brought into
      requisition to receive the two gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Pott, &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick&mdash;Mr. Pickwick of London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pott received Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s paternal grasp of the hand with
      enchanting sweetness; and Mr. Winkle, who had not been announced at all,
      sidled and bowed, unnoticed, in an obscure corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;P. my dear&rsquo;&mdash;said Mrs. Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My life,&rsquo; said Mr. Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray introduce the other gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg a thousand pardons,&rsquo; said Mr. Pott. &lsquo;Permit me, Mrs. Pott, Mr.&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Winkle,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Winkle,&rsquo; echoed Mr. Pott; and the ceremony of introduction was complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We owe you many apologies, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;for disturbing
      your domestic arrangements at so short a notice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg you won&rsquo;t mention it, sir,&rsquo; replied the feminine Pott, with
      vivacity. &lsquo;It is a high treat to me, I assure you, to see any new faces;
      living as I do, from day to day, and week to week, in this dull place, and
      seeing nobody.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody, my dear!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pott archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody but you,&rsquo; retorted Mrs. Pott, with asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said the host in explanation of his wife&rsquo;s
      lament, &lsquo;that we are in some measure cut off from many enjoyments and
      pleasures of which we might otherwise partake. My public station, as
      editor of the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i>, the position which that paper
      holds in the country, my constant immersion in the vortex of politics&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;P. my dear&mdash;&rsquo; interposed Mrs. Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My life&mdash;&rsquo; said the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish, my dear, you would endeavour to find some topic of conversation
      in which these gentlemen might take some rational interest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, my love,&rsquo; said Mr. Pott, with great humility, &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick does
      take an interest in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s well for him if he can,&rsquo; said Mrs. Pott emphatically; &lsquo;I am wearied
      out of my life with your politics, and quarrels with the <i>Independent</i>,
      and nonsense. I am quite astonished, P., at your making such an exhibition
      of your absurdity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, my dear&mdash;&rsquo; said Mr. Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, nonsense, don&rsquo;t talk to me,&rsquo; said Mrs. Pott. &lsquo;Do you play ecarte,
      Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be very happy to learn under your tuition,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, draw that little table into this window, and let me get out
      of hearing of those prosy politics.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jane,&rsquo; said Mr. Pott, to the servant who brought in candles, &lsquo;go down
      into the office, and bring me up the file of the <i>Gazette</i> for
      eighteen hundred and twenty-six. I&rsquo;ll read you,&rsquo; added the editor, turning
      to Mr. Pickwick&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll just read you a few of the leaders I wrote at
      that time upon the Buff job of appointing a new tollman to the turnpike
      here; I rather think they&rsquo;ll amuse you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to hear them very much indeed,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up came the file, and down sat the editor, with Mr. Pickwick at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have in vain pored over the leaves of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s note-book, in the
      hope of meeting with a general summary of these beautiful compositions. We
      have every reason to believe that he was perfectly enraptured with the
      vigour and freshness of the style; indeed Mr. Winkle has recorded the fact
      that his eyes were closed, as if with excess of pleasure, during the whole
      time of their perusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The announcement of supper put a stop both to the game of ecarte, and the
      recapitulation of the beauties of the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i>. Mrs. Pott
      was in the highest spirits and the most agreeable humour. Mr. Winkle had
      already made considerable progress in her good opinion, and she did not
      hesitate to inform him, confidentially, that Mr. Pickwick was &lsquo;a
      delightful old dear.&rsquo; These terms convey a familiarity of expression, in
      which few of those who were intimately acquainted with that
      colossal-minded man, would have presumed to indulge. We have preserved
      them, nevertheless, as affording at once a touching and a convincing proof
      of the estimation in which he was held by every class of society, and the
      ease with which he made his way to their hearts and feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a late hour of the night&mdash;long after Mr. Tupman and Mr.
      Snodgrass had fallen asleep in the inmost recesses of the Peacock&mdash;when
      the two friends retired to rest. Slumber soon fell upon the senses of Mr.
      Winkle, but his feelings had been excited, and his admiration roused; and
      for many hours after sleep had rendered him insensible to earthly objects,
      the face and figure of the agreeable Mrs. Pott presented themselves again
      and again to his wandering imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise and bustle which ushered in the morning were sufficient to
      dispel from the mind of the most romantic visionary in existence, any
      associations but those which were immediately connected with the
      rapidly-approaching election. The beating of drums, the blowing of horns
      and trumpets, the shouting of men, and tramping of horses, echoed and
      re-echoed through the streets from the earliest dawn of day; and an
      occasional fight between the light skirmishers of either party at once
      enlivened the preparations, and agreeably diversified their character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as his valet appeared at his bedroom door,
      just as he was concluding his toilet; &lsquo;all alive to-day, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Reg&rsquo;lar game, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; &lsquo;our people&rsquo;s a-collecting down
      at the Town Arms, and they&rsquo;re a-hollering themselves hoarse already.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;do they seem devoted to their party, Sam?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never see such dewotion in my life, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Energetic, eh?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncommon,&rsquo; replied Sam; &lsquo;I never see men eat and drink so much afore. I
      wonder they ain&rsquo;t afeer&rsquo;d o&rsquo; bustin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the mistaken kindness of the gentry here,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery likely,&rsquo; replied Sam briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fine, fresh, hearty fellows they seem,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, glancing from
      the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery fresh,&rsquo; replied Sam; &lsquo;me and the two waiters at the Peacock has been
      a-pumpin&rsquo; over the independent woters as supped there last night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pumping over independent voters!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said his attendant, &lsquo;every man slept vere he fell down; we dragged
      &lsquo;em out, one by one, this mornin&rsquo;, and put &lsquo;em under the pump, and they&rsquo;re
      in reg&rsquo;lar fine order now. Shillin&rsquo; a head the committee paid for that
      &lsquo;ere job.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can such things be!&rsquo; exclaimed the astonished Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord bless your heart, sir,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;why where was you half baptised?&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      nothin&rsquo;, that ain&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothin&rsquo; at all, Sir,&rsquo; replied his attendant. &lsquo;The night afore the last
      day o&rsquo; the last election here, the opposite party bribed the barmaid at
      the Town Arms, to hocus the brandy-and-water of fourteen unpolled electors
      as was a-stoppin&rsquo; in the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by &ldquo;hocussing&rdquo; brandy-and-water?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Puttin&rsquo; laud&rsquo;num in it,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;Blessed if she didn&rsquo;t send &lsquo;em all
      to sleep till twelve hours arter the election was over. They took one man
      up to the booth, in a truck, fast asleep, by way of experiment, but it was
      no go&mdash;they wouldn&rsquo;t poll him; so they brought him back, and put him
      to bed again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange practices, these,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; half speaking to himself and
      half addressing Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not half so strange as a miraculous circumstance as happened to my own
      father, at an election time, in this wery place, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What was that?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, he drove a coach down here once,&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;&rsquo;lection time came on,
      and he was engaged by vun party to bring down woters from London. Night
      afore he was going to drive up, committee on t&rsquo; other side sends for him
      quietly, and away he goes vith the messenger, who shows him in;&mdash;large
      room&mdash;lots of gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n&mdash;heaps of papers, pens and ink, and all
      that &lsquo;ere. &ldquo;Ah, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; says the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n in the chair, &ldquo;glad to see
      you, sir; how are you?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Wery well, thank &lsquo;ee, Sir,&rdquo; says my father;
      &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re pretty middlin,&rdquo; says he.&mdash;&ldquo;Pretty well, thank&rsquo;ee,
      Sir,&rdquo; says the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n; &ldquo;sit down, Mr. Weller&mdash;pray sit down, sir.&rdquo;
       So my father sits down, and he and the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n looks wery hard at each
      other. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember me?&rdquo; said the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n.&mdash;&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I
      do,&rdquo; says my father.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, I know you,&rdquo; says the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n: &ldquo;know&rsquo;d
      you when you was a boy,&rdquo; says he.&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t remember you,&rdquo; says
      my father.&mdash;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wery odd,&rdquo; says the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Wery,&rdquo;
       says my father.&mdash;&ldquo;You must have a bad mem&rsquo;ry, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; says the
      gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n.&mdash;&ldquo;Well, it is a wery bad &lsquo;un,&rdquo; says my father.&mdash;&ldquo;I
      thought so,&rdquo; says the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n. So then they pours him out a glass of
      wine, and gammons him about his driving, and gets him into a reg&rsquo;lar good
      humour, and at last shoves a twenty-pound note into his hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wery
      bad road between this and London,&rdquo; says the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n.&mdash;&ldquo;Here and
      there it is a heavy road,&rdquo; says my father.&mdash;&rdquo; &lsquo;Specially near the
      canal, I think,&rdquo; says the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n.&mdash;&ldquo;Nasty bit that &lsquo;ere,&rdquo; says my
      father.&mdash;&ldquo;Well, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; says the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a wery good
      whip, and can do what you like with your horses, we know. We&rsquo;re all wery
      fond o&rsquo; you, Mr. Weller, so in case you should have an accident when
      you&rsquo;re bringing these here woters down, and should tip &lsquo;em over into the
      canal vithout hurtin&rsquo; of &lsquo;em, this is for yourself,&rdquo; says he.&mdash;&ldquo;Gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n,
      you&rsquo;re wery kind,&rdquo; says my father, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll drink your health in another
      glass of wine,&rdquo; says he; vich he did, and then buttons up the money, and
      bows himself out. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe, sir,&rsquo; continued Sam, with a look
      of inexpressible impudence at his master, &lsquo;that on the wery day as he came
      down with them woters, his coach <i>was </i>upset on that &lsquo;ere wery spot,
      and ev&rsquo;ry man on &lsquo;em was turned into the canal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And got out again?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; replied Sam very slowly, &lsquo;I rather think one old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n was
      missin&rsquo;; I know his hat was found, but I ain&rsquo;t quite certain whether his
      head was in it or not. But what I look at is the hex-traordinary and
      wonderful coincidence, that arter what that gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n said, my father&rsquo;s
      coach should be upset in that wery place, and on that wery day!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is, no doubt, a very extraordinary circumstance indeed,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Pickwick. &lsquo;But brush my hat, Sam, for I hear Mr. Winkle calling me to
      breakfast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words Mr. Pickwick descended to the parlour, where he found
      breakfast laid, and the family already assembled. The meal was hastily
      despatched; each of the gentlemen&rsquo;s hats was decorated with an enormous
      blue favour, made up by the fair hands of Mrs. Pott herself; and as Mr.
      Winkle had undertaken to escort that lady to a house-top, in the immediate
      vicinity of the hustings, Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Pott repaired alone to the
      Town Arms, from the back window of which, one of Mr. Slumkey&rsquo;s committee
      was addressing six small boys and one girl, whom he dignified, at every
      second sentence, with the imposing title of &lsquo;Men of Eatanswill,&rsquo; whereat
      the six small boys aforesaid cheered prodigiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stable-yard exhibited unequivocal symptoms of the glory and strength
      of the Eatanswill Blues. There was a regular army of blue flags, some with
      one handle, and some with two, exhibiting appropriate devices, in golden
      characters four feet high, and stout in proportion. There was a grand band
      of trumpets, bassoons, and drums, marshalled four abreast, and earning
      their money, if ever men did, especially the drum-beaters, who were very
      muscular. There were bodies of constables with blue staves, twenty
      committee-men with blue scarfs, and a mob of voters with blue cockades.
      There were electors on horseback and electors afoot. There was an open
      carriage-and-four, for the Honourable Samuel Slumkey; and there were four
      carriage-and-pair, for his friends and supporters; and the flags were
      rustling, and the band was playing, and the constables were swearing, and
      the twenty committee-men were squabbling, and the mob were shouting, and
      the horses were backing, and the post-boys perspiring; and everybody, and
      everything, then and there assembled, was for the special use, behoof,
      honour, and renown, of the Honourable Samuel Slumkey, of Slumkey Hall, one
      of the candidates for the representation of the borough of Eatanswill, in
      the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loud and long were the cheers, and mighty was the rustling of one of the
      blue flags, with &lsquo;Liberty of the Press&rsquo; inscribed thereon, when the sandy
      head of Mr. Pott was discerned in one of the windows, by the mob beneath;
      and tremendous was the enthusiasm when the Honourable Samuel Slumkey
      himself, in top-boots, and a blue neckerchief, advanced and seized the
      hand of the said Pott, and melodramatically testified by gestures to the
      crowd, his ineffaceable obligations to the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is everything ready?&rsquo; said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey to Mr. Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everything, my dear Sir,&rsquo; was the little man&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing has been omitted, I hope?&rsquo; said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing has been left undone, my dear sir&mdash;nothing whatever. There
      are twenty washed men at the street door for you to shake hands with; and
      six children in arms that you&rsquo;re to pat on the head, and inquire the age
      of; be particular about the children, my dear sir&mdash;it has always a
      great effect, that sort of thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take care,&rsquo; said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And, perhaps, my dear Sir,&rsquo; said the cautious little man, &lsquo;perhaps if you
      could&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean to say it&rsquo;s indispensable&mdash;but if you could
      manage to kiss one of &lsquo;em, it would produce a very great impression on the
      crowd.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it have as good an effect if the proposer or seconder did that?&rsquo; 
      said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I am afraid it wouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied the agent; &lsquo;if it were done by
      yourself, my dear Sir, I think it would make you very popular.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey, with a resigned air,
      &lsquo;then it must be done. That&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arrange the procession,&rsquo; cried the twenty committee-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst the cheers of the assembled throng, the band, and the constables,
      and the committee-men, and the voters, and the horsemen, and the
      carriages, took their places&mdash;each of the two-horse vehicles being
      closely packed with as many gentlemen as could manage to stand upright in
      it; and that assigned to Mr. Perker, containing Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Tupman,
      Mr. Snodgrass, and about half a dozen of the committee besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of awful suspense as the procession waited for the
      Honourable Samuel Slumkey to step into his carriage. Suddenly the crowd
      set up a great cheering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has come out,&rsquo; said little Mr. Perker, greatly excited; the more so as
      their position did not enable them to see what was going forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another cheer, much louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has shaken hands with the men,&rsquo; cried the little agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another cheer, far more vehement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has patted the babies on the head,&rsquo; said Mr. Perker, trembling with
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      A roar of applause that rent the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has kissed one of &lsquo;em!&rsquo; exclaimed the delighted little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has kissed another,&rsquo; gasped the excited manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s kissing &lsquo;em all!&rsquo; screamed the enthusiastic little gentleman, and
      hailed by the deafening shouts of the multitude, the procession moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      How or by what means it became mixed up with the other procession, and how
      it was ever extricated from the confusion consequent thereupon, is more
      than we can undertake to describe, inasmuch as Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s hat was
      knocked over his eyes, nose, and mouth, by one poke of a Buff flag-staff,
      very early in the proceedings. He describes himself as being surrounded on
      every side, when he could catch a glimpse of the scene, by angry and
      ferocious countenances, by a vast cloud of dust, and by a dense crowd of
      combatants. He represents himself as being forced from the carriage by
      some unseen power, and being personally engaged in a pugilistic encounter;
      but with whom, or how, or why, he is wholly unable to state. He then felt
      himself forced up some wooden steps by the persons from behind; and on
      removing his hat, found himself surrounded by his friends, in the very
      front of the left hand side of the hustings. The right was reserved for
      the Buff party, and the centre for the mayor and his officers; one of whom&mdash;the
      fat crier of Eatanswill&mdash;was ringing an enormous bell, by way of
      commanding silence, while Mr. Horatio Fizkin, and the Honourable Samuel
      Slumkey, with their hands upon their hearts, were bowing with the utmost
      affability to the troubled sea of heads that inundated the open space in
      front; and from whence arose a storm of groans, and shouts, and yells, and
      hootings, that would have done honour to an earthquake.

    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s Winkle,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, pulling his friend by the sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, putting on his spectacles, which he had
      fortunately kept in his pocket hitherto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, &lsquo;on the top of that house.&rsquo; And there, sure
      enough, in the leaden gutter of a tiled roof, were Mr. Winkle and Mrs.
      Pott, comfortably seated in a couple of chairs, waving their handkerchiefs
      in token of recognition&mdash;a compliment which Mr. Pickwick returned by
      kissing his hand to the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proceedings had not yet commenced; and as an inactive crowd is
      generally disposed to be jocose, this very innocent action was sufficient
      to awaken their facetiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you wicked old rascal,&rsquo; cried one voice, &lsquo;looking arter the girls,
      are you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you wenerable sinner,&rsquo; cried another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Putting on his spectacles to look at a married &lsquo;ooman!&rsquo; said a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see him a-winkin&rsquo; at her, with his wicked old eye,&rsquo; shouted a fourth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look arter your wife, Pott,&rsquo; bellowed a fifth&mdash;and then there was a
      roar of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As these taunts were accompanied with invidious comparisons between Mr.
      Pickwick and an aged ram, and several witticisms of the like nature; and
      as they moreover rather tended to convey reflections upon the honour of an
      innocent lady, Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s indignation was excessive; but as silence
      was proclaimed at the moment, he contented himself by scorching the mob
      with a look of pity for their misguided minds, at which they laughed more
      boisterously than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silence!&rsquo; roared the mayor&rsquo;s attendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whiffin, proclaim silence,&rsquo; said the mayor, with an air of pomp befitting
      his lofty station. In obedience to this command the crier performed
      another concerto on the bell, whereupon a gentleman in the crowd called
      out &lsquo;Muffins&rsquo;; which occasioned another laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; said the mayor, at as loud a pitch as he could possibly force
      his voice to&mdash;&lsquo;gentlemen. Brother electors of the borough of
      Eatanswill. We are met here to-day for the purpose of choosing a
      representative in the room of our late&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the mayor was interrupted by a voice in the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suc-cess to the mayor!&rsquo; cried the voice, &lsquo;and may he never desert the
      nail and sarspan business, as he got his money by.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This allusion to the professional pursuits of the orator was received with
      a storm of delight, which, with a bell-accompaniment, rendered the
      remainder of his speech inaudible, with the exception of the concluding
      sentence, in which he thanked the meeting for the patient attention with
      which they heard him throughout&mdash;an expression of gratitude which
      elicited another burst of mirth, of about a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, a tall, thin gentleman, in a very stiff white neckerchief, after
      being repeatedly desired by the crowd to &lsquo;send a boy home, to ask whether
      he hadn&rsquo;t left his voice under the pillow,&rsquo; begged to nominate a fit and
      proper person to represent them in Parliament. And when he said it was
      Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, of Fizkin Lodge, near Eatanswill, the Fizkinites
      applauded, and the Slumkeyites groaned, so long, and so loudly, that both
      he and the seconder might have sung comic songs in lieu of speaking,
      without anybody&rsquo;s being a bit the wiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friends of Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, having had their innings, a little
      choleric, pink-faced man stood forward to propose another fit and proper
      person to represent the electors of Eatanswill in Parliament; and very
      swimmingly the pink-faced gentleman would have got on, if he had not been
      rather too choleric to entertain a sufficient perception of the fun of the
      crowd. But after a very few sentences of figurative eloquence, the
      pink-faced gentleman got from denouncing those who interrupted him in the
      mob, to exchanging defiances with the gentlemen on the hustings; whereupon
      arose an uproar which reduced him to the necessity of expressing his
      feelings by serious pantomime, which he did, and then left the stage to
      his seconder, who delivered a written speech of half an hour&rsquo;s length, and
      wouldn&rsquo;t be stopped, because he had sent it all to the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i>,
      and the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i> had already printed it, every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, of Fizkin Lodge, near Eatanswill, presented
      himself for the purpose of addressing the electors; which he no sooner
      did, than the band employed by the Honourable Samuel Slumkey, commenced
      performing with a power to which their strength in the morning was a
      trifle; in return for which, the Buff crowd belaboured the heads and
      shoulders of the Blue crowd; on which the Blue crowd endeavoured to
      dispossess themselves of their very unpleasant neighbours the Buff crowd;
      and a scene of struggling, and pushing, and fighting, succeeded, to which
      we can no more do justice than the mayor could, although he issued
      imperative orders to twelve constables to seize the ringleaders, who might
      amount in number to two hundred and fifty, or thereabouts. At all these
      encounters, Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, of Fizkin Lodge, and his friends,
      waxed fierce and furious; until at last Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, of Fizkin
      Lodge, begged to ask his opponent, the Honourable Samuel Slumkey, of
      Slumkey Hall, whether that band played by his consent; which question the
      Honourable Samuel Slumkey declining to answer, Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, of
      Fizkin Lodge, shook his fist in the countenance of the Honourable Samuel
      Slumkey, of Slumkey Hall; upon which the Honourable Samuel Slumkey, his
      blood being up, defied Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, to mortal combat. At this
      violation of all known rules and precedents of order, the mayor commanded
      another fantasia on the bell, and declared that he would bring before
      himself, both Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, of Fizkin Lodge, and the Honourable
      Samuel Slumkey, of Slumkey Hall, and bind them over to keep the peace.
      Upon this terrific denunciation, the supporters of the two candidates
      interfered, and after the friends of each party had quarrelled in pairs,
      for three-quarters of an hour, Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, touched his hat to
      the Honourable Samuel Slumkey; the Honourable Samuel Slumkey touched his
      to Horatio Fizkin, Esquire; the band was stopped; the crowd were partially
      quieted; and Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, was permitted to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speeches of the two candidates, though differing in every other
      respect, afforded a beautiful tribute to the merit and high worth of the
      electors of Eatanswill. Both expressed their opinion that a more
      independent, a more enlightened, a more public-spirited, a more
      noble-minded, a more disinterested set of men than those who had promised
      to vote for him, never existed on earth; each darkly hinted his suspicions
      that the electors in the opposite interest had certain swinish and
      besotted infirmities which rendered them unfit for the exercise of the
      important duties they were called upon to discharge. Fizkin expressed his
      readiness to do anything he was wanted: Slumkey, his determination to do
      nothing that was asked of him. Both said that the trade, the manufactures,
      the commerce, the prosperity of Eatanswill, would ever be dearer to their
      hearts than any earthly object; and each had it in his power to state,
      with the utmost confidence, that he was the man who would eventually be
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a show of hands; the mayor decided in favour of the Honourable
      Samuel Slumkey, of Slumkey Hall. Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, of Fizkin Lodge,
      demanded a poll, and a poll was fixed accordingly. Then a vote of thanks
      was moved to the mayor for his able conduct in the chair; and the mayor,
      devoutly wishing that he had had a chair to display his able conduct in
      (for he had been standing during the whole proceedings), returned thanks.
      The processions reformed, the carriages rolled slowly through the crowd,
      and its members screeched and shouted after them as their feelings or
      caprice dictated.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the whole time of the polling, the town was in a perpetual fever of
      excitement. Everything was conducted on the most liberal and delightful
      scale. Excisable articles were remarkably cheap at all the public-houses;
      and spring vans paraded the streets for the accommodation of voters who
      were seized with any temporary dizziness in the head&mdash;an epidemic
      which prevailed among the electors, during the contest, to a most alarming
      extent, and under the influence of which they might frequently be seen
      lying on the pavements in a state of utter insensibility. A small body of
      electors remained unpolled on the very last day. They were calculating and
      reflecting persons, who had not yet been convinced by the arguments of
      either party, although they had frequent conferences with each. One hour
      before the close of the poll, Mr. Perker solicited the honour of a private
      interview with these intelligent, these noble, these patriotic men. It was
      granted. His arguments were brief but satisfactory. They went in a body to
      the poll; and when they returned, the Honourable Samuel Slumkey, of
      Slumkey Hall, was returned also.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. COMPRISING A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AT THE PEACOCK
      ASSEMBLED; AND A TALE TOLD BY A BAGMAN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is pleasant to
      turn from contemplating the strife and turmoil of political existence, to
      the peaceful repose of private life. Although in reality no great partisan
      of either side, Mr. Pickwick was sufficiently fired with Mr. Pott&rsquo;s
      enthusiasm, to apply his whole time and attention to the proceedings, of
      which the last chapter affords a description compiled from his own
      memoranda. Nor while he was thus occupied was Mr. Winkle idle, his whole
      time being devoted to pleasant walks and short country excursions with
      Mrs. Pott, who never failed, when such an opportunity presented itself, to
      seek some relief from the tedious monotony she so constantly complained
      of. The two gentlemen being thus completely domesticated in the editor&rsquo;s
      house, Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass were in a great measure cast upon
      their own resources. Taking but little interest in public affairs, they
      beguiled their time chiefly with such amusements as the Peacock afforded,
      which were limited to a bagatelle-board in the first floor, and a
      sequestered skittle-ground in the back yard. In the science and nicety of
      both these recreations, which are far more abstruse than ordinary men
      suppose, they were gradually initiated by Mr. Weller, who possessed a
      perfect knowledge of such pastimes. Thus, notwithstanding that they were
      in a great measure deprived of the comfort and advantage of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      society, they were still enabled to beguile the time, and to prevent its
      hanging heavily on their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the evening, however, that the Peacock presented attractions
      which enabled the two friends to resist even the invitations of the
      gifted, though prosy, Pott. It was in the evening that the &lsquo;commercial
      room&rsquo; was filled with a social circle, whose characters and manners it was
      the delight of Mr. Tupman to observe; whose sayings and doings it was the
      habit of Mr. Snodgrass to note down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people know what sort of places commercial rooms usually are. That of
      the Peacock differed in no material respect from the generality of such
      apartments; that is to say, it was a large, bare-looking room, the
      furniture of which had no doubt been better when it was newer, with a
      spacious table in the centre, and a variety of smaller dittos in the
      corners; an extensive assortment of variously shaped chairs, and an old
      Turkey carpet, bearing about the same relative proportion to the size of
      the room, as a lady&rsquo;s pocket-handkerchief might to the floor of a
      watch-box. The walls were garnished with one or two large maps; and
      several weather-beaten rough greatcoats, with complicated capes, dangled
      from a long row of pegs in one corner. The mantel-shelf was ornamented
      with a wooden inkstand, containing one stump of a pen and half a wafer; a
      road-book and directory; a county history minus the cover; and the mortal
      remains of a trout in a glass coffin. The atmosphere was redolent of
      tobacco-smoke, the fumes of which had communicated a rather dingy hue to
      the whole room, and more especially to the dusty red curtains which shaded
      the windows. On the sideboard a variety of miscellaneous articles were
      huddled together, the most conspicuous of which were some very cloudy
      fish-sauce cruets, a couple of driving-boxes, two or three whips, and as
      many travelling shawls, a tray of knives and forks, and the mustard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here it was that Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass were seated on the evening
      after the conclusion of the election, with several other temporary inmates
      of the house, smoking and drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, gents,&rsquo; said a stout, hale personage of about forty, with only one
      eye&mdash;a very bright black eye, which twinkled with a roguish
      expression of fun and good-humour, &lsquo;our noble selves, gents. I always
      propose that toast to the company, and drink Mary to myself. Eh, Mary!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get along with you, you wretch,&rsquo; said the hand-maiden, obviously not
      ill-pleased with the compliment, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go away, Mary,&rsquo; said the black-eyed man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me alone, imperence,&rsquo; said the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said the one-eyed man, calling after the girl as she left
      the room. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll step out by and by, Mary. Keep your spirits up, dear.&rsquo; 
      Here he went through the not very difficult process of winking upon the
      company with his solitary eye, to the enthusiastic delight of an elderly
      personage with a dirty face and a clay pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rum creeters is women,&rsquo; said the dirty-faced man, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! no mistake about that,&rsquo; said a very red-faced man, behind a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this little bit of philosophy there was another pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s rummer things than women in this world though, mind you,&rsquo; said
      the man with the black eye, slowly filling a large Dutch pipe, with a most
      capacious bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you married?&rsquo; inquired the dirty-faced man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought not.&rsquo; Here the dirty-faced man fell into ecstasies of mirth at
      his own retort, in which he was joined by a man of bland voice and placid
      countenance, who always made it a point to agree with everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Women, after all, gentlemen,&rsquo; said the enthusiastic Mr. Snodgrass, &lsquo;are
      the great props and comforts of our existence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So they are,&rsquo; said the placid gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When they&rsquo;re in a good humour,&rsquo; interposed the dirty-faced man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that&rsquo;s very true,&rsquo; said the placid one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I repudiate that qualification,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass, whose thoughts were
      fast reverting to Emily Wardle. &lsquo;I repudiate it with disdain&mdash;with
      indignation. Show me the man who says anything against women, as women,
      and I boldly declare he is not a man.&rsquo; And Mr. Snodgrass took his cigar
      from his mouth, and struck the table violently with his clenched fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s good sound argument,&rsquo; said the placid man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Containing a position which I deny,&rsquo; interrupted he of the dirty
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And there&rsquo;s certainly a very great deal of truth in what you observe too,
      Sir,&rsquo; said the placid gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your health, Sir,&rsquo; said the bagman with the lonely eye, bestowing an
      approving nod on Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Snodgrass acknowledged the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I always like to hear a good argument,&rsquo; continued the bagman, &lsquo;a sharp
      one, like this: it&rsquo;s very improving; but this little argument about women
      brought to my mind a story I have heard an old uncle of mine tell, the
      recollection of which, just now, made me say there were rummer things than
      women to be met with, sometimes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to hear that same story,&rsquo; said the red-faced man with the
      cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Should you?&rsquo; was the only reply of the bagman, who continued to smoke
      with great vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So should I,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, speaking for the first time. He was always
      anxious to increase his stock of experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Should <i>you</i>? Well then, I&rsquo;ll tell it. No, I won&rsquo;t. I know you won&rsquo;t
      believe it,&rsquo; said the man with the roguish eye, making that organ look
      more roguish than ever. &lsquo;If you say it&rsquo;s true, of course I shall,&rsquo; said
      Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, upon that understanding I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rsquo; replied the traveller. &lsquo;Did
      you ever hear of the great commercial house of Bilson &amp; Slum? But it
      doesn&rsquo;t matter though, whether you did or not, because they retired from
      business long since. It&rsquo;s eighty years ago, since the circumstance
      happened to a traveller for that house, but he was a particular friend of
      my uncle&rsquo;s; and my uncle told the story to me. It&rsquo;s a queer name; but he
      used to call it
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  THE BAGMAN&rsquo;S STORY
</pre>
    <p>
      and he used to tell it, something in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One winter&rsquo;s evening, about five o&rsquo;clock, just as it began to grow dusk,
      a man in a gig might have been seen urging his tired horse along the road
      which leads across Marlborough Downs, in the direction of Bristol. I say
      he might have been seen, and I have no doubt he would have been, if
      anybody but a blind man had happened to pass that way; but the weather was
      so bad, and the night so cold and wet, that nothing was out but the water,
      and so the traveller jogged along in the middle of the road, lonesome and
      dreary enough. If any bagman of that day could have caught sight of the
      little neck-or-nothing sort of gig, with a clay-coloured body and red
      wheels, and the vixenish, ill tempered, fast-going bay mare, that looked
      like a cross between a butcher&rsquo;s horse and a twopenny post-office pony, he
      would have known at once, that this traveller could have been no other
      than Tom Smart, of the great house of Bilson and Slum, Cateaton Street,
      City. However, as there was no bagman to look on, nobody knew anything at
      all about the matter; and so Tom Smart and his clay-coloured gig with the
      red wheels, and the vixenish mare with the fast pace, went on together,
      keeping the secret among them, and nobody was a bit the wiser.
    </p>

      &lsquo;There are many pleasanter places even in this dreary world, than
      Marlborough Downs when it blows hard; and if you throw in beside, a gloomy
      winter&rsquo;s evening, a miry and sloppy road, and a pelting fall of heavy
      rain, and try the effect, by way of experiment, in your own proper person,
      you will experience the full force of this observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wind blew&mdash;not up the road or down it, though that&rsquo;s bad enough,
      but sheer across it, sending the rain slanting down like the lines they
      used to rule in the copy-books at school, to make the boys slope well. For
      a moment it would die away, and the traveller would begin to delude
      himself into the belief that, exhausted with its previous fury, it had
      quietly laid itself down to rest, when, whoo! he could hear it growling
      and whistling in the distance, and on it would come rushing over the
      hill-tops, and sweeping along the plain, gathering sound and strength as
      it drew nearer, until it dashed with a heavy gust against horse and man,
      driving the sharp rain into their ears, and its cold damp breath into
      their very bones; and past them it would scour, far, far away, with a
      stunning roar, as if in ridicule of their weakness, and triumphant in the
      consciousness of its own strength and power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The bay mare splashed away, through the mud and water, with drooping
      ears; now and then tossing her head as if to express her disgust at this
      very ungentlemanly behaviour of the elements, but keeping a good pace
      notwithstanding, until a gust of wind, more furious than any that had yet
      assailed them, caused her to stop suddenly and plant her four feet firmly
      against the ground, to prevent her being blown over. It&rsquo;s a special mercy
      that she did this, for if she <i>had </i>been blown over, the vixenish
      mare was so light, and the gig was so light, and Tom Smart such a light
      weight into the bargain, that they must infallibly have all gone rolling
      over and over together, until they reached the confines of earth, or until
      the wind fell; and in either case the probability is, that neither the
      vixenish mare, nor the clay-coloured gig with the red wheels, nor Tom
      Smart, would ever have been fit for service again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Well, damn my straps and whiskers,&rdquo; says Tom Smart (Tom sometimes had an
      unpleasant knack of swearing)&mdash;&ldquo;damn my straps and whiskers,&rdquo; says
      Tom, &ldquo;if this ain&rsquo;t pleasant, blow me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll very likely ask me why, as Tom Smart had been pretty well blown
      already, he expressed this wish to be submitted to the same process again.
      I can&rsquo;t say&mdash;all I know is, that Tom Smart said so&mdash;or at least
      he always told my uncle he said so, and it&rsquo;s just the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Blow me,&rdquo; says Tom Smart; and the mare neighed as if she were precisely
      of the same opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cheer up, old girl,&rdquo; said Tom, patting the bay mare on the neck with the
      end of his whip. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do pushing on, such a night as this; the first
      house we come to we&rsquo;ll put up at, so the faster you go the sooner it&rsquo;s
      over. Soho, old girl&mdash;gently&mdash;gently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whether the vixenish mare was sufficiently well acquainted with the tones
      of Tom&rsquo;s voice to comprehend his meaning, or whether she found it colder
      standing still than moving on, of course I can&rsquo;t say. But I can say that
      Tom had no sooner finished speaking, than she pricked up her ears, and
      started forward at a speed which made the clay-coloured gig rattle until
      you would have supposed every one of the red spokes were going to fly out
      on the turf of Marlborough Downs; and even Tom, whip as he was, couldn&rsquo;t
      stop or check her pace, until she drew up of her own accord, before a
      roadside inn on the right-hand side of the way, about half a quarter of a
      mile from the end of the Downs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tom cast a hasty glance at the upper part of the house as he threw the
      reins to the hostler, and stuck the whip in the box. It was a strange old
      place, built of a kind of shingle, inlaid, as it were, with cross-beams,
      with gabled-topped windows projecting completely over the pathway, and a
      low door with a dark porch, and a couple of steep steps leading down into
      the house, instead of the modern fashion of half a dozen shallow ones
      leading up to it. It was a comfortable-looking place though, for there was
      a strong, cheerful light in the bar window, which shed a bright ray across
      the road, and even lighted up the hedge on the other side; and there was a
      red flickering light in the opposite window, one moment but faintly
      discernible, and the next gleaming strongly through the drawn curtains,
      which intimated that a rousing fire was blazing within. Marking these
      little evidences with the eye of an experienced traveller, Tom dismounted
      with as much agility as his half-frozen limbs would permit, and entered
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In less than five minutes&rsquo; time, Tom was ensconced in the room opposite
      the bar&mdash;the very room where he had imagined the fire blazing&mdash;before
      a substantial, matter-of-fact, roaring fire, composed of something short
      of a bushel of coals, and wood enough to make half a dozen decent
      gooseberry bushes, piled half-way up the chimney, and roaring and
      crackling with a sound that of itself would have warmed the heart of any
      reasonable man. This was comfortable, but this was not all; for a
      smartly-dressed girl, with a bright eye and a neat ankle, was laying a
      very clean white cloth on the table; and as Tom sat with his slippered
      feet on the fender, and his back to the open door, he saw a charming
      prospect of the bar reflected in the glass over the chimney-piece, with
      delightful rows of green bottles and gold labels, together with jars of
      pickles and preserves, and cheeses and boiled hams, and rounds of beef,
      arranged on shelves in the most tempting and delicious array. Well, this
      was comfortable too; but even this was not all&mdash;for in the bar,
      seated at tea at the nicest possible little table, drawn close up before
      the brightest possible little fire, was a buxom widow of somewhere about
      eight-and-forty or thereabouts, with a face as comfortable as the bar, who
      was evidently the landlady of the house, and the supreme ruler over all
      these agreeable possessions. There was only one drawback to the beauty of
      the whole picture, and that was a tall man&mdash;a very tall man&mdash;in
      a brown coat and bright basket buttons, and black whiskers and wavy black
      hair, who was seated at tea with the widow, and who it required no great
      penetration to discover was in a fair way of persuading her to be a widow
      no longer, but to confer upon him the privilege of sitting down in that
      bar, for and during the whole remainder of the term of his natural life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tom Smart was by no means of an irritable or envious disposition, but
      somehow or other the tall man with the brown coat and the bright basket
      buttons did rouse what little gall he had in his composition, and did make
      him feel extremely indignant, the more especially as he could now and then
      observe, from his seat before the glass, certain little affectionate
      familiarities passing between the tall man and the widow, which
      sufficiently denoted that the tall man was as high in favour as he was in
      size. Tom was fond of hot punch&mdash;I may venture to say he was <i>very</i>
      fond of hot punch&mdash;and after he had seen the vixenish mare well fed
      and well littered down, and had eaten every bit of the nice little hot
      dinner which the widow tossed up for him with her own hands, he just
      ordered a tumbler of it by way of experiment. Now, if there was one thing
      in the whole range of domestic art, which the widow could manufacture
      better than another, it was this identical article; and the first tumbler
      was adapted to Tom Smart&rsquo;s taste with such peculiar nicety, that he
      ordered a second with the least possible delay. Hot punch is a pleasant
      thing, gentlemen&mdash;an extremely pleasant thing under any circumstances&mdash;but
      in that snug old parlour, before the roaring fire, with the wind blowing
      outside till every timber in the old house creaked again, Tom Smart found
      it perfectly delightful. He ordered another tumbler, and then another&mdash;I
      am not quite certain whether he didn&rsquo;t order another after that&mdash;but
      the more he drank of the hot punch, the more he thought of the tall man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Confound his impudence!&rdquo; said Tom to himself, &ldquo;what business has he in
      that snug bar? Such an ugly villain too!&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;If the widow had any
      taste, she might surely pick up some better fellow than that.&rdquo; Here Tom&rsquo;s
      eye wandered from the glass on the chimney-piece to the glass on the
      table; and as he felt himself becoming gradually sentimental, he emptied
      the fourth tumbler of punch and ordered a fifth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tom Smart, gentlemen, had always been very much attached to the public
      line. It had been long his ambition to stand in a bar of his own, in a
      green coat, knee-cords, and tops. He had a great notion of taking the
      chair at convivial dinners, and he had often thought how well he could
      preside in a room of his own in the talking way, and what a capital
      example he could set to his customers in the drinking department. All
      these things passed rapidly through Tom&rsquo;s mind as he sat drinking the hot
      punch by the roaring fire, and he felt very justly and properly indignant
      that the tall man should be in a fair way of keeping such an excellent
      house, while he, Tom Smart, was as far off from it as ever. So, after
      deliberating over the two last tumblers, whether he hadn&rsquo;t a perfect right
      to pick a quarrel with the tall man for having contrived to get into the
      good graces of the buxom widow, Tom Smart at last arrived at the
      satisfactory conclusion that he was a very ill-used and persecuted
      individual, and had better go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Up a wide and ancient staircase the smart girl preceded Tom, shading the
      chamber candle with her hand, to protect it from the currents of air which
      in such a rambling old place might have found plenty of room to disport
      themselves in, without blowing the candle out, but which did blow it out
      nevertheless&mdash;thus affording Tom&rsquo;s enemies an opportunity of
      asserting that it was he, and not the wind, who extinguished the candle,
      and that while he pretended to be blowing it alight again, he was in fact
      kissing the girl. Be this as it may, another light was obtained, and Tom
      was conducted through a maze of rooms, and a labyrinth of passages, to the
      apartment which had been prepared for his reception, where the girl bade
      him good-night and left him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was a good large room with big closets, and a bed which might have
      served for a whole boarding-school, to say nothing of a couple of oaken
      presses that would have held the baggage of a small army; but what struck
      Tom&rsquo;s fancy most was a strange, grim-looking, high backed chair, carved in
      the most fantastic manner, with a flowered damask cushion, and the round
      knobs at the bottom of the legs carefully tied up in red cloth, as if it
      had got the gout in its toes. Of any other queer chair, Tom would only
      have thought it was a queer chair, and there would have been an end of the
      matter; but there was something about this particular chair, and yet he
      couldn&rsquo;t tell what it was, so odd and so unlike any other piece of
      furniture he had ever seen, that it seemed to fascinate him. He sat down
      before the fire, and stared at the old chair for half an hour.&mdash;Damn
      the chair, it was such a strange old thing, he couldn&rsquo;t take his eyes off
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, slowly undressing himself, and staring at the old chair
      all the while, which stood with a mysterious aspect by the bedside, &ldquo;I
      never saw such a rum concern as that in my days. Very odd,&rdquo; said Tom, who
      had got rather sage with the hot punch&mdash;&ldquo;very odd.&rdquo; Tom shook his
      head with an air of profound wisdom, and looked at the chair again. He
      couldn&rsquo;t make anything of it though, so he got into bed, covered himself
      up warm, and fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In about half an hour, Tom woke up with a start, from a confused dream of
      tall men and tumblers of punch; and the first object that presented itself
      to his waking imagination was the queer chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t look at it any more,&rdquo; said Tom to himself, and he squeezed his
      eyelids together, and tried to persuade himself he was going to sleep
      again. No use; nothing but queer chairs danced before his eyes, kicking up
      their legs, jumping over each other&rsquo;s backs, and playing all kinds of
      antics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I may as well see one real chair, as two or three complete sets of false
      ones,&rdquo; said Tom, bringing out his head from under the bedclothes. There it
      was, plainly discernible by the light of the fire, looking as provoking as
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tom gazed at the chair; and, suddenly as he looked at it, a most
      extraordinary change seemed to come over it. The carving of the back
      gradually assumed the lineaments and expression of an old, shrivelled
      human face; the damask cushion became an antique, flapped waistcoat; the
      round knobs grew into a couple of feet, encased in red cloth slippers; and
      the whole chair looked like a very ugly old man, of the previous century,
      with his arms akimbo. Tom sat up in bed, and rubbed his eyes to dispel the
      illusion. No. The chair was an ugly old gentleman; and what was more, he
      was winking at Tom Smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tom was naturally a headlong, careless sort of dog, and he had had five
      tumblers of hot punch into the bargain; so, although he was a little
      startled at first, he began to grow rather indignant when he saw the old
      gentleman winking and leering at him with such an impudent air. At length
      he resolved that he wouldn&rsquo;t stand it; and as the old face still kept
      winking away as fast as ever, Tom said, in a very angry tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What the devil are you winking at me for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Because I like it, Tom Smart,&rdquo; said the chair; or the old gentleman,
      whichever you like to call him. He stopped winking though, when Tom spoke,
      and began grinning like a superannuated monkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;How do you know my name, old nut-cracker face?&rdquo; inquired Tom Smart,
      rather staggered; though he pretended to carry it off so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Come, come, Tom,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not the way to address
      solid Spanish mahogany. Damme, you couldn&rsquo;t treat me with less respect if
      I was veneered.&rdquo; When the old gentleman said this, he looked so fierce
      that Tom began to grow frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to treat you with any disrespect, Sir,&rdquo; said Tom, in a
      much humbler tone than he had spoken in at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the old fellow, &ldquo;perhaps not&mdash;perhaps not. Tom&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I know everything about you, Tom; everything. You&rsquo;re very poor, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I certainly am,&rdquo; said Tom Smart. &ldquo;But how came you to know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; said the old gentleman; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re much too fond of
      punch, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tom Smart was just on the point of protesting that he hadn&rsquo;t tasted a
      drop since his last birthday, but when his eye encountered that of the old
      gentleman he looked so knowing that Tom blushed, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, &ldquo;the widow&rsquo;s a fine woman&mdash;remarkably
      fine woman&mdash;eh, Tom?&rdquo; Here the old fellow screwed up his eyes, cocked
      up one of his wasted little legs, and looked altogether so unpleasantly
      amorous, that Tom was quite disgusted with the levity of his behaviour&mdash;at
      his time of life, too!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I am her guardian, Tom,&rdquo; said the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; inquired Tom Smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I knew her mother, Tom,&rdquo; said the old fellow: &ldquo;and her grandmother. She
      was very fond of me&mdash;made me this waistcoat, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Did she?&rdquo; said Tom Smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;And these shoes,&rdquo; said the old fellow, lifting up one of the red cloth
      mufflers; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t mention it, Tom. I shouldn&rsquo;t like to have it known
      that she was so much attached to me. It might occasion some unpleasantness
      in the family.&rdquo; When the old rascal said this, he looked so extremely
      impertinent, that, as Tom Smart afterwards declared, he could have sat
      upon him without remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I have been a great favourite among the women in my time, Tom,&rdquo; said the
      profligate old debauchee; &ldquo;hundreds of fine women have sat in my lap for
      hours together. What do you think of that, you dog, eh!&rdquo; The old gentleman
      was proceeding to recount some other exploits of his youth, when he was
      seized with such a violent fit of creaking that he was unable to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Just serves you right, old boy,&rdquo; thought Tom Smart; but he didn&rsquo;t say
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the old fellow, &ldquo;I am a good deal troubled with this now. I am
      getting old, Tom, and have lost nearly all my nails. I have had an
      operation performed, too&mdash;a small piece let into my back&mdash;and I
      found it a severe trial, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I dare say you did, Sir,&rdquo; said Tom Smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;However,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not the point. Tom! I want you
      to marry the widow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Me, Sir!&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You,&rdquo; said the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Bless your reverend locks,&rdquo; said Tom (he had a few scattered horse-hairs
      left)&mdash;&ldquo;bless your reverend locks, she wouldn&rsquo;t have me.&rdquo; And Tom
      sighed involuntarily, as he thought of the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; said the old gentleman firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s somebody else in the wind. A tall man&mdash;a
      confoundedly tall man&mdash;with black whiskers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said the old gentleman; &ldquo;she will never have him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;If you stood in the bar, old gentleman, you&rsquo;d
      tell another story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Pooh, pooh,&rdquo; said the old gentleman. &ldquo;I know all about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;The kissing behind the door, and all that sort of thing, Tom,&rdquo; said the
      old gentleman. And here he gave another impudent look, which made Tom very
      wroth, because as you all know, gentlemen, to hear an old fellow, who
      ought to know better, talking about these things, is very unpleasant&mdash;nothing
      more so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I know all about that, Tom,&rdquo; said the old gentleman. &ldquo;I have seen it
      done very often in my time, Tom, between more people than I should like to
      mention to you; but it never came to anything after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You must have seen some queer things,&rdquo; said Tom, with an inquisitive
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You may say that, Tom,&rdquo; replied the old fellow, with a very complicated
      wink. &ldquo;I am the last of my family, Tom,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, with a
      melancholy sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Was it a large one?&rdquo; inquired Tom Smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;There were twelve of us, Tom,&rdquo; said the old gentleman; &ldquo;fine,
      straight-backed, handsome fellows as you&rsquo;d wish to see. None of your
      modern abortions&mdash;all with arms, and with a degree of polish, though
      I say it that should not, which it would have done your heart good to
      behold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s become of the others, Sir?&rdquo; asked Tom Smart&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old gentleman applied his elbow to his eye as he replied, &ldquo;Gone, Tom,
      gone. We had hard service, Tom, and they hadn&rsquo;t all my constitution. They
      got rheumatic about the legs and arms, and went into kitchens and other
      hospitals; and one of &lsquo;em, with long service and hard usage, positively
      lost his senses&mdash;he got so crazy that he was obliged to be burnt.
      Shocking thing that, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Dreadful!&rdquo; said Tom Smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old fellow paused for a few minutes, apparently struggling with his
      feelings of emotion, and then said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;However, Tom, I am wandering from the point. This tall man, Tom, is a
      rascally adventurer. The moment he married the widow, he would sell off
      all the furniture, and run away. What would be the consequence? She would
      be deserted and reduced to ruin, and I should catch my death of cold in
      some broker&rsquo;s shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me,&rdquo; said the old gentleman. &ldquo;Of you, Tom, I entertain a
      very different opinion; for I well know that if you once settled yourself
      in a public-house, you would never leave it, as long as there was anything
      to drink within its walls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I am very much obliged to you for your good opinion, Sir,&rdquo; said Tom
      Smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; resumed the old gentleman, in a dictatorial tone, &ldquo;you shall
      have her, and he shall not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What is to prevent it?&rdquo; said Tom Smart eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;This disclosure,&rdquo; replied the old gentleman; &ldquo;he is already married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;How can I prove it?&rdquo; said Tom, starting half out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old gentleman untucked his arm from his side, and having pointed to
      one of the oaken presses, immediately replaced it, in its old position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;He little thinks,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, &ldquo;that in the right-hand
      pocket of a pair of trousers in that press, he has left a letter,
      entreating him to return to his disconsolate wife, with six&mdash;mark me,
      Tom&mdash;six babes, and all of them small ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As the old gentleman solemnly uttered these words, his features grew less
      and less distinct, and his figure more shadowy. A film came over Tom
      Smart&rsquo;s eyes. The old man seemed gradually blending into the chair, the
      damask waistcoat to resolve into a cushion, the red slippers to shrink
      into little red cloth bags. The light faded gently away, and Tom Smart
      fell back on his pillow, and dropped asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Morning aroused Tom from the lethargic slumber, into which he had fallen
      on the disappearance of the old man. He sat up in bed, and for some
      minutes vainly endeavoured to recall the events of the preceding night.
      Suddenly they rushed upon him. He looked at the chair; it was a fantastic
      and grim-looking piece of furniture, certainly, but it must have been a
      remarkably ingenious and lively imagination, that could have discovered
      any resemblance between it and an old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;How are you, old boy?&rdquo; said Tom. He was bolder in the daylight&mdash;most
      men are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The chair remained motionless, and spoke not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Miserable morning,&rdquo; said Tom. No. The chair would not be drawn into
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Which press did you point to?&mdash;you can tell me that,&rdquo; said Tom.
      Devil a word, gentlemen, the chair would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much trouble to open it, anyhow,&rdquo; said Tom, getting out of bed
      very deliberately. He walked up to one of the presses. The key was in the
      lock; he turned it, and opened the door. There was a pair of trousers
      there. He put his hand into the pocket, and drew forth the identical
      letter the old gentleman had described!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Queer sort of thing, this,&rdquo; said Tom Smart, looking first at the chair
      and then at the press, and then at the letter, and then at the chair
      again. &ldquo;Very queer,&rdquo; said Tom. But, as there was nothing in either, to
      lessen the queerness, he thought he might as well dress himself, and
      settle the tall man&rsquo;s business at once&mdash;just to put him out of his
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tom surveyed the rooms he passed through, on his way downstairs, with the
      scrutinising eye of a landlord; thinking it not impossible, that before
      long, they and their contents would be his property. The tall man was
      standing in the snug little bar, with his hands behind him, quite at home.
      He grinned vacantly at Tom. A casual observer might have supposed he did
      it, only to show his white teeth; but Tom Smart thought that a
      consciousness of triumph was passing through the place where the tall
      man&rsquo;s mind would have been, if he had had any. Tom laughed in his face;
      and summoned the landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Good-morning ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Tom Smart, closing the door of the little
      parlour as the widow entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Good-morning, Sir,&rdquo; said the widow. &ldquo;What will you take for breakfast,
      sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tom was thinking how he should open the case, so he made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a very nice ham,&rdquo; said the widow, &ldquo;and a beautiful cold larded
      fowl. Shall I send &lsquo;em in, Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These words roused Tom from his reflections. His admiration of the widow
      increased as she spoke. Thoughtful creature! Comfortable provider!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Who is that gentleman in the bar, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; inquired Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;His name is Jinkins, Sir,&rdquo; said the widow, slightly blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a tall man,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;He is a very fine man, Sir,&rdquo; replied the widow, &ldquo;and a very nice
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Is there anything more you want, Sir?&rdquo; inquired the widow, rather
      puzzled by Tom&rsquo;s manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;My dear ma&rsquo;am, will you have the kindness to sit
      down for one moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The widow looked much amazed, but she sat down, and Tom sat down too,
      close beside her. I don&rsquo;t know how it happened, gentlemen&mdash;indeed my
      uncle used to tell me that Tom Smart said he didn&rsquo;t know how it happened
      either&mdash;but somehow or other the palm of Tom&rsquo;s hand fell upon the
      back of the widow&rsquo;s hand, and remained there while he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;My dear ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Tom Smart&mdash;he had always a great notion of
      committing the amiable&mdash;&ldquo;my dear ma&rsquo;am, you deserve a very excellent
      husband&mdash;you do indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Lor, Sir!&rdquo; said the widow&mdash;as well she might; Tom&rsquo;s mode of
      commencing the conversation being rather unusual, not to say startling;
      the fact of his never having set eyes upon her before the previous night
      being taken into consideration. &ldquo;Lor, Sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I scorn to flatter, my dear ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Tom Smart. &ldquo;You deserve a very
      admirable husband, and whoever he is, he&rsquo;ll be a very lucky man.&rdquo; As Tom
      said this, his eye involuntarily wandered from the widow&rsquo;s face to the
      comfort around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The widow looked more puzzled than ever, and made an effort to rise. Tom
      gently pressed her hand, as if to detain her, and she kept her seat.
      Widows, gentlemen, are not usually timorous, as my uncle used to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I am sure I am very much obliged to you, Sir, for your good opinion,&rdquo;
       said the buxom landlady, half laughing; &ldquo;and if ever I marry again&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;<i>If</i>,&rdquo; said Tom Smart, looking very shrewdly out of the right-hand
      corner of his left eye. &ldquo;<i>If</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the widow, laughing outright this time, &ldquo;<i>when </i>I do, I
      hope I shall have as good a husband as you describe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Jinkins, to wit,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Lor, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;I know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I am sure nobody who knows him, knows anything bad of him,&rdquo; said the
      widow, bridling up at the mysterious air with which Tom had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; said Tom Smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The widow began to think it was high time to cry, so she took out her
      handkerchief, and inquired whether Tom wished to insult her, whether he
      thought it like a gentleman to take away the character of another
      gentleman behind his back, why, if he had got anything to say, he didn&rsquo;t
      say it to the man, like a man, instead of terrifying a poor weak woman in
      that way; and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it to him fast enough,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;only I want you to hear it
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired the widow, looking intently in Tom&rsquo;s countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll astonish you,&rdquo; said Tom, putting his hand in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;If it is, that he wants money,&rdquo; said the widow, &ldquo;I know that already,
      and you needn&rsquo;t trouble yourself.&rdquo; &lsquo;&ldquo;Pooh, nonsense, that&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said
      Tom Smart, &ldquo;I want money. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, dear, what can it be?&rdquo; exclaimed the poor widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; said Tom Smart. He slowly drew forth the letter,
      and unfolded it. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t scream?&rdquo; said Tom doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied the widow; &ldquo;let me see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go fainting away, or any of that nonsense?&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; returned the widow hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t run out, and blow him up,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;because I&rsquo;ll do all that
      for you. You had better not exert yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the widow, &ldquo;let me see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied Tom Smart; and, with these words, he placed the letter
      in the widow&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen, I have heard my uncle say, that Tom Smart said the widow&rsquo;s
      lamentations when she heard the disclosure would have pierced a heart of
      stone. Tom was certainly very tender-hearted, but they pierced his, to the
      very core. The widow rocked herself to and fro, and wrung her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, the deception and villainy of the man!&rdquo; said the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Frightful, my dear ma&rsquo;am; but compose yourself,&rdquo; said Tom Smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t compose myself,&rdquo; shrieked the widow. &ldquo;I shall never find
      anyone else I can love so much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, yes you will, my dear soul,&rdquo; said Tom Smart, letting fall a shower
      of the largest-sized tears, in pity for the widow&rsquo;s misfortunes. Tom
      Smart, in the energy of his compassion, had put his arm round the widow&rsquo;s
      waist; and the widow, in a passion of grief, had clasped Tom&rsquo;s hand. She
      looked up in Tom&rsquo;s face, and smiled through her tears. Tom looked down in
      hers, and smiled through his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never could find out, gentlemen, whether Tom did or did not kiss the
      widow at that particular moment. He used to tell my uncle he didn&rsquo;t, but I
      have my doubts about it. Between ourselves, gentlemen, I rather think he
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At all events, Tom kicked the very tall man out at the front door half an
      hour later, and married the widow a month after. And he used to drive
      about the country, with the clay-coloured gig with the red wheels, and the
      vixenish mare with the fast pace, till he gave up business many years
      afterwards, and went to France with his wife; and then the old house was
      pulled down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you allow me to ask you,&rsquo; said the inquisitive old gentleman, &lsquo;what
      became of the chair?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; replied the one-eyed bagman, &lsquo;it was observed to creak very much on
      the day of the wedding; but Tom Smart couldn&rsquo;t say for certain whether it
      was with pleasure or bodily infirmity. He rather thought it was the
      latter, though, for it never spoke afterwards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everybody believed the story, didn&rsquo;t they?&rsquo; said the dirty-faced man,
      refilling his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Except Tom&rsquo;s enemies,&rsquo; replied the bagman. &lsquo;Some of &lsquo;em said Tom invented
      it altogether; and others said he was drunk and fancied it, and got hold
      of the wrong trousers by mistake before he went to bed. But nobody ever
      minded what <i>they </i>said.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tom Smart said it was all true?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every word.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And your uncle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every letter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They must have been very nice men, both of &lsquo;em,&rsquo; said the dirty-faced
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, they were,&rsquo; replied the bagman; &lsquo;very nice men indeed!&rsquo;

      conscience had been somewhat reproaching him for his recent neglect of his
      friends at the Peacock; and he was just on the point of walking forth in
      quest of them, on the third morning after the election had terminated,
      when his faithful valet put into his hand a card, on which was engraved
      the following inscription:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Mrs. Leo Hunter
     THE DEN. EATANSWILL.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Person&rsquo;s a-waitin&rsquo;,&rsquo; said Sam, epigrammatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does the person want me, Sam?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He wants you partickler; and no one else &lsquo;ll do, as the devil&rsquo;s private
      secretary said ven he fetched avay Doctor Faustus,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>He</i>. Is it a gentleman?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A wery good imitation o&rsquo; one, if it ain&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But this is a lady&rsquo;s card,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Given me by a gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, howsoever,&rsquo; replied Sam, &lsquo;and he&rsquo;s a-waitin&rsquo; in
      the drawing-room&mdash;said he&rsquo;d rather wait all day, than not see you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick, on hearing this determination, descended to the
      drawing-room, where sat a grave man, who started up on his entrance, and
      said, with an air of profound respect:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick, I presume?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The same.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Allow me, Sir, the honour of grasping your hand. Permit me, Sir, to shake
      it,&rsquo; said the grave man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. The stranger shook the extended hand, and
      then continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have heard of your fame, sir. The noise of your antiquarian discussion
      has reached the ears of Mrs. Leo Hunter&mdash;my wife, sir; I am Mr. Leo
      Hunter&rsquo;&mdash;the stranger paused, as if he expected that Mr. Pickwick
      would be overcome by the disclosure; but seeing that he remained perfectly
      calm, proceeded&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My wife, sir&mdash;Mrs. Leo Hunter&mdash;is proud to number among her
      acquaintance all those who have rendered themselves celebrated by their
      works and talents. Permit me, sir, to place in a conspicuous part of the
      list the name of Mr. Pickwick, and his brother-members of the club that
      derives its name from him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be extremely happy to make the acquaintance of such a lady, sir,&rsquo; 
      replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You <i>shall </i>make it, sir,&rsquo; said the grave man. &lsquo;To-morrow morning,
      sir, we give a public breakfast&mdash;a <i>fete champetre</i>&mdash;to a
      great number of those who have rendered themselves celebrated by their
      works and talents. Permit Mrs. Leo Hunter, Sir, to have the gratification
      of seeing you at the Den.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With great pleasure,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Leo Hunter has many of these breakfasts, Sir,&rsquo; resumed the new
      acquaintance&mdash;&lsquo;"feasts of reason,&rdquo; sir, &ldquo;and flows of soul,&rdquo; as
      somebody who wrote a sonnet to Mrs. Leo Hunter on her breakfasts,
      feelingly and originally observed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was <i>he</i> celebrated for his works and talents?&rsquo; inquired Mr.
      Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was Sir,&rsquo; replied the grave man, &lsquo;all Mrs. Leo Hunter&rsquo;s acquaintances
      are; it is her ambition, sir, to have no other acquaintance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a very noble ambition,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I inform Mrs. Leo Hunter, that that remark fell from your lips, sir,
      she will indeed be proud,&rsquo; said the grave man. &lsquo;You have a gentleman in
      your train, who has produced some beautiful little poems, I think, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friend Mr. Snodgrass has a great taste for poetry,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So has Mrs. Leo Hunter, Sir. She dotes on poetry, sir. She adores it; I
      may say that her whole soul and mind are wound up, and entwined with it.
      She has produced some delightful pieces, herself, sir. You may have met
      with her &ldquo;Ode to an Expiring Frog,&rdquo; sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You astonish me, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Leo Hunter. &lsquo;It created an immense
      sensation. It was signed with an &ldquo;L&rdquo; and eight stars, and appeared
      originally in a lady&rsquo;s magazine. It commenced&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;&ldquo;Can I view thee panting, lying
     On thy stomach, without sighing;
     Can I unmoved see thee dying
       On a log
       Expiring frog!&rdquo;&rsquo; 

</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beautiful!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fine,&rsquo; said Mr. Leo Hunter; &lsquo;so simple.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The next verse is still more touching. Shall I repeat it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you please,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It runs thus,&rsquo; said the grave man, still more gravely.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;&ldquo;Say, have fiends in shape of boys,
     With wild halloo, and brutal noise,
     Hunted thee from marshy joys,
       With a dog,
       Expiring frog!&rdquo;&rsquo; 

</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Finely expressed,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All point, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Leo Hunter; &lsquo;but you shall hear Mrs. Leo Hunter
      repeat it. She can do justice to it, Sir. She will repeat it, in
      character, Sir, to-morrow morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In character!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As Minerva. But I forgot&mdash;it&rsquo;s a fancy-dress <i>dejeune</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, glancing at his own figure&mdash;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
      possibly&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t, sir; can&rsquo;t!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Leo Hunter. &lsquo;Solomon Lucas, the Jew in
      the High Street, has thousands of fancy-dresses. Consider, Sir, how many
      appropriate characters are open for your selection. Plato, Zeno, Epicurus,
      Pythagoras&mdash;all founders of clubs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know that,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;but as I cannot put myself in
      competition with those great men, I cannot presume to wear their dresses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The grave man considered deeply, for a few seconds, and then said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On reflection, Sir, I don&rsquo;t know whether it would not afford Mrs. Leo
      Hunter greater pleasure, if her guests saw a gentleman of your celebrity
      in his own costume, rather than in an assumed one. I may venture to
      promise an exception in your case, sir&mdash;yes, I am quite certain that,
      on behalf of Mrs. Leo Hunter, I may venture to do so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that case,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I shall have great pleasure in
      coming.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I waste your time, Sir,&rsquo; said the grave man, as if suddenly
      recollecting himself. &lsquo;I know its value, sir. I will not detain you. I may
      tell Mrs. Leo Hunter, then, that she may confidently expect you and your
      distinguished friends? Good-morning, Sir, I am proud to have beheld so
      eminent a personage&mdash;not a step sir; not a word.&rsquo; And without giving
      Mr. Pickwick time to offer remonstrance or denial, Mr. Leo Hunter stalked
      gravely away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick took up his hat, and repaired to the Peacock, but Mr. Winkle
      had conveyed the intelligence of the fancy-ball there, before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Pott&rsquo;s going,&rsquo; were the first words with which he saluted his
      leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As Apollo,&rsquo; replied Winkle. &lsquo;Only Pott objects to the tunic.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is right. He is quite right,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; so she&rsquo;s going to wear a white satin gown with gold spangles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll hardly know what she&rsquo;s meant for; will they?&rsquo; inquired Mr.
      Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course they will,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle indignantly. &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll see her
      lyre, won&rsquo;t they?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True; I forgot that,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall go as a bandit,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with a sudden start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As a bandit,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Tupman, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, gazing with solemn sternness
      at his friend&mdash;&lsquo;you don&rsquo;t mean to say, Mr. Tupman, that it is your
      intention to put yourself into a green velvet jacket, with a two-inch
      tail?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such <i>is</i> my intention, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Tupman warmly. &lsquo;And why
      not, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, considerably excited&mdash;&lsquo;because you
      are too old, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too old!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if any further ground of objection be wanting,&rsquo; continued Mr.
      Pickwick, &lsquo;you are too fat, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, his face suffused with a crimson glow, &lsquo;this is an
      insult.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, in the same tone, &lsquo;it is not half the insult
      to you, that your appearance in my presence in a green velvet jacket, with
      a two-inch tail, would be to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a fellow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re another!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman advanced a step or two, and glared at Mr. Pickwick. Mr.
      Pickwick returned the glare, concentrated into a focus by means of his
      spectacles, and breathed a bold defiance. Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle
      looked on, petrified at beholding such a scene between two such men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, after a short pause, speaking in a low, deep
      voice, &lsquo;you have called me old.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And fat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I reiterate the charge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a fellow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fearful pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My attachment to your person, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, speaking in a voice
      tremulous with emotion, and tucking up his wristbands meanwhile, &lsquo;is great&mdash;very
      great&mdash;but upon that person, I must take summary vengeance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come on, Sir!&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. Stimulated by the exciting nature of
      the dialogue, the heroic man actually threw himself into a paralytic
      attitude, confidently supposed by the two bystanders to have been intended
      as a posture of defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass, suddenly recovering the power of speech,
      of which intense astonishment had previously bereft him, and rushing
      between the two, at the imminent hazard of receiving an application on the
      temple from each&mdash;&lsquo;what! Mr. Pickwick, with the eyes of the world
      upon you! Mr. Tupman! who, in common with us all, derives a lustre from
      his undying name! For shame, gentlemen; for shame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The unwonted lines which momentary passion had ruled in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      clear and open brow, gradually melted away, as his young friend spoke,
      like the marks of a black-lead pencil beneath the softening influence of
      india-rubber. His countenance had resumed its usual benign expression, ere
      he concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been hasty,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;very hasty. Tupman; your hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark shadow passed from Mr. Tupman&rsquo;s face, as he warmly grasped the
      hand of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been hasty, too,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; interrupted Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;the fault was mine. You will wear the
      green velvet jacket?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; replied Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To oblige me, you will,&rsquo; resumed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, I will,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/0294m.jpg" alt="0294m " /><br />

      <a href="images/0294.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      It was accordingly settled that Mr. Tupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass,
      should all wear fancy-dresses. Thus Mr. Pickwick was led by the very
      warmth of his own good feelings to give his consent to a proceeding from
      which his better judgment would have recoiled&mdash;a more striking
      illustration of his amiable character could hardly have been conceived,
      even if the events recorded in these pages had been wholly imaginary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Leo Hunter had not exaggerated the resources of Mr. Solomon Lucas. His
      wardrobe was extensive&mdash;very extensive&mdash;not strictly classical
      perhaps, not quite new, nor did it contain any one garment made precisely
      after the fashion of any age or time, but everything was more or less
      spangled; and what can be prettier than spangles! It may be objected that
      they are not adapted to the daylight, but everybody knows that they would
      glitter if there were lamps; and nothing can be clearer than that if
      people give fancy-balls in the day-time, and the dresses do not show quite
      as well as they would by night, the fault lies solely with the people who
      give the fancy-balls, and is in no wise chargeable on the spangles. Such
      was the convincing reasoning of Mr. Solomon Lucas; and influenced by such
      arguments did Mr. Tupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass engage to array
      themselves in costumes which his taste and experience induced him to
      recommend as admirably suited to the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A carriage was hired from the Town Arms, for the accommodation of the
      Pickwickians, and a chariot was ordered from the same repository, for the
      purpose of conveying Mr. and Mrs. Pott to Mrs. Leo Hunter&rsquo;s grounds, which
      Mr. Pott, as a delicate acknowledgment of having received an invitation,
      had already confidently predicted in the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i> &lsquo;would
      present a scene of varied and delicious enchantment&mdash;a bewildering
      coruscation of beauty and talent&mdash;a lavish and prodigal display of
      hospitality&mdash;above all, a degree of splendour softened by the most
      exquisite taste; and adornment refined with perfect harmony and the
      chastest good keeping&mdash;compared with which, the fabled gorgeousness
      of Eastern fairyland itself would appear to be clothed in as many dark and
      murky colours, as must be the mind of the splenetic and unmanly being who
      could presume to taint with the venom of his envy, the preparations made
      by the virtuous and highly distinguished lady at whose shrine this humble
      tribute of admiration was offered.&rsquo; This last was a piece of biting
      sarcasm against the <i>Independent</i>, who, in consequence of not having
      been invited at all, had been, through four numbers, affecting to sneer at
      the whole affair, in his very largest type, with all the adjectives in
      capital letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning came: it was a pleasant sight to behold Mr. Tupman in full
      brigand&rsquo;s costume, with a very tight jacket, sitting like a pincushion
      over his back and shoulders, the upper portion of his legs incased in the
      velvet shorts, and the lower part thereof swathed in the complicated
      bandages to which all brigands are peculiarly attached. It was pleasing to
      see his open and ingenuous countenance, well mustachioed and corked,
      looking out from an open shirt collar; and to contemplate the sugar-loaf
      hat, decorated with ribbons of all colours, which he was compelled to
      carry on his knee, inasmuch as no known conveyance with a top to it, would
      admit of any man&rsquo;s carrying it between his head and the roof. Equally
      humorous and agreeable was the appearance of Mr. Snodgrass in blue satin
      trunks and cloak, white silk tights and shoes, and Grecian helmet, which
      everybody knows (and if they do not, Mr. Solomon Lucas did) to have been
      the regular, authentic, everyday costume of a troubadour, from the
      earliest ages down to the time of their final disappearance from the face
      of the earth. All this was pleasant, but this was as nothing compared with
      the shouting of the populace when the carriage drew up, behind Mr. Pott&rsquo;s
      chariot, which chariot itself drew up at Mr. Pott&rsquo;s door, which door
      itself opened, and displayed the great Pott accoutred as a Russian officer
      of justice, with a tremendous knout in his hand&mdash;tastefully typical
      of the stern and mighty power of the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i>, and the
      fearful lashings it bestowed on public offenders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bravo!&rsquo; shouted Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass from the passage, when they
      beheld the walking allegory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bravo!&rsquo; Mr. Pickwick was heard to exclaim, from the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hoo-roar Pott!&rsquo; shouted the populace. Amid these salutations, Mr. Pott,
      smiling with that kind of bland dignity which sufficiently testified that
      he felt his power, and knew how to exert it, got into the chariot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there emerged from the house, Mrs. Pott, who would have looked very
      like Apollo if she hadn&rsquo;t had a gown on, conducted by Mr. Winkle, who, in
      his light-red coat could not possibly have been mistaken for anything but
      a sportsman, if he had not borne an equal resemblance to a general
      postman. Last of all came Mr. Pickwick, whom the boys applauded as loud as
      anybody, probably under the impression that his tights and gaiters were
      some remnants of the dark ages; and then the two vehicles proceeded
      towards Mrs. Leo Hunter&rsquo;s; Mr. Weller (who was to assist in waiting) being
      stationed on the box of that in which his master was seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one of the men, women, boys, girls, and babies, who were assembled
      to see the visitors in their fancy-dresses, screamed with delight and
      ecstasy, when Mr. Pickwick, with the brigand on one arm, and the
      troubadour on the other, walked solemnly up the entrance. Never were such
      shouts heard as those which greeted Mr. Tupman&rsquo;s efforts to fix the
      sugar-loaf hat on his head, by way of entering the garden in style.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preparations were on the most delightful scale; fully realising the
      prophetic Pott&rsquo;s anticipations about the gorgeousness of Eastern
      fairyland, and at once affording a sufficient contradiction to the
      malignant statements of the reptile <i>Independent</i>. The grounds were
      more than an acre and a quarter in extent, and they were filled with
      people! Never was such a blaze of beauty, and fashion, and literature.
      There was the young lady who &lsquo;did&rsquo; the poetry in the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i>,
      in the garb of a sultana, leaning upon the arm of the young gentleman who
      &lsquo;did&rsquo; the review department, and who was appropriately habited in a
      field-marshal&rsquo;s uniform&mdash;the boots excepted. There were hosts of
      these geniuses, and any reasonable person would have thought it honour
      enough to meet them. But more than these, there were half a dozen lions
      from London&mdash;authors, real authors, who had written whole books, and
      printed them afterwards&mdash;and here you might see &lsquo;em, walking about,
      like ordinary men, smiling, and talking&mdash;aye, and talking pretty
      considerable nonsense too, no doubt with the benign intention of rendering
      themselves intelligible to the common people about them. Moreover, there
      was a band of music in pasteboard caps; four something-ean singers in the
      costume of their country, and a dozen hired waiters in the costume of <i>their
      </i>country&mdash;and very dirty costume too. And above all, there was
      Mrs. Leo Hunter in the character of Minerva, receiving the company, and
      overflowing with pride and gratification at the notion of having called
      such distinguished individuals together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said a servant, as that gentleman approached the
      presiding goddess, with his hat in his hand, and the brigand and
      troubadour on either arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! Where!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Leo Hunter, starting up, in an affected
      rapture of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it possible that I have really the gratification of beholding Mr.
      Pickwick himself!&rsquo; ejaculated Mrs. Leo Hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No other, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, bowing very low. &lsquo;Permit me to
      introduce my friends&mdash;Mr. Tupman&mdash;Mr. Winkle&mdash;Mr. Snodgrass&mdash;to
      the authoress of &ldquo;The Expiring Frog.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Very few people but those who have tried it, know what a difficult process
      it is to bow in green velvet smalls, and a tight jacket, and high-crowned
      hat; or in blue satin trunks and white silks, or knee-cords and top-boots
      that were never made for the wearer, and have been fixed upon him without
      the remotest reference to the comparative dimensions of himself and the
      suit. Never were such distortions as Mr. Tupman&rsquo;s frame underwent in his
      efforts to appear easy and graceful&mdash;never was such ingenious
      posturing, as his fancy-dressed friends exhibited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Mrs. Leo Hunter, &lsquo;I must make you promise not to stir
      from my side the whole day. There are hundreds of people here, that I must
      positively introduce you to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are very kind, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the first place, here are my little girls; I had almost forgotten
      them,&rsquo; said Minerva, carelessly pointing towards a couple of full-grown
      young ladies, of whom one might be about twenty, and the other a year or
      two older, and who were dressed in very juvenile costumes&mdash;whether to
      make them look young, or their mamma younger, Mr. Pickwick does not
      distinctly inform us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are very beautiful,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as the juveniles turned
      away, after being presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are very like their mamma, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pott, majestically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you naughty man,&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Leo Hunter, playfully tapping the
      editor&rsquo;s arm with her fan (Minerva with a fan!).
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why now, my dear Mrs. Hunter,&rsquo; said Mr. Pott, who was trumpeter in
      ordinary at the Den, &lsquo;you know that when your picture was in the
      exhibition of the Royal Academy, last year, everybody inquired whether it
      was intended for you, or your youngest daughter; for you were so much
      alike that there was no telling the difference between you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and if they did, why need you repeat it, before strangers?&rsquo; said
      Mrs. Leo Hunter, bestowing another tap on the slumbering lion of the
      Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Count, count,&rsquo; screamed Mrs. Leo Hunter to a well-whiskered individual in
      a foreign uniform, who was passing by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you want me?&rsquo; said the count, turning back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to introduce two very clever people to each other,&rsquo; said Mrs. Leo
      Hunter. &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick, I have great pleasure in introducing you to Count
      Smorltork.&rsquo; She added in a hurried whisper to Mr. Pickwick&mdash;&lsquo;The
      famous foreigner&mdash;gathering materials for his great work on England&mdash;hem!&mdash;Count
      Smorltork, Mr. Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick saluted the count with all the reverence due to so great a
      man, and the count drew forth a set of tablets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What you say, Mrs. Hunt?&rsquo; inquired the count, smiling graciously on the
      gratified Mrs. Leo Hunter, &lsquo;Pig Vig or Big Vig&mdash;what you call&mdash;lawyer&mdash;eh?
      I see&mdash;that is it. Big Vig&rsquo;&mdash;and the count was proceeding to
      enter Mr. Pickwick in his tablets, as a gentleman of the long robe, who
      derived his name from the profession to which he belonged, when Mrs. Leo
      Hunter interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, count,&rsquo; said the lady, &lsquo;Pick-wick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, ah, I see,&rsquo; replied the count. &lsquo;Peek&mdash;christian name; Weeks&mdash;surname;
      good, ver good. Peek Weeks. How you do, Weeks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite well, I thank you,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, with all his usual
      affability. &lsquo;Have you been long in England?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Long&mdash;ver long time&mdash;fortnight&mdash;more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you stay here long?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One week.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will have enough to do,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick smiling, &lsquo;to gather all
      the materials you want in that time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh, they are gathered,&rsquo; said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are here,&rsquo; added the count, tapping his forehead significantly.
      &lsquo;Large book at home&mdash;full of notes&mdash;music, picture, science,
      potry, poltic; all tings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The word politics, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;comprises in itself, a
      difficult study of no inconsiderable magnitude.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the count, drawing out the tablets again, &lsquo;ver good&mdash;fine
      words to begin a chapter. Chapter forty-seven. Poltics. The word poltic
      surprises by himself&mdash;&rsquo; And down went Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s remark, in Count
      Smorltork&rsquo;s tablets, with such variations and additions as the count&rsquo;s
      exuberant fancy suggested, or his imperfect knowledge of the language
      occasioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Count,&rsquo; said Mrs. Leo Hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Hunt,&rsquo; replied the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is Mr. Snodgrass, a friend of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s, and a poet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop,&rsquo; exclaimed the count, bringing out the tablets once more. &lsquo;Head,
      potry&mdash;chapter, literary friends&mdash;name, Snowgrass; ver good.
      Introduced to Snowgrass&mdash;great poet, friend of Peek Weeks&mdash;by
      Mrs. Hunt, which wrote other sweet poem&mdash;what is that name?&mdash;Fog&mdash;Perspiring
      Fog&mdash;ver good&mdash;ver good indeed.&rsquo; And the count put up his
      tablets, and with sundry bows and acknowledgments walked away, thoroughly
      satisfied that he had made the most important and valuable additions to
      his stock of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wonderful man, Count Smorltork,&rsquo; said Mrs. Leo Hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sound philosopher,&rsquo; said Mr. Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clear-headed, strong-minded person,&rsquo; added Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chorus of bystanders took up the shout of Count Smorltork&rsquo;s praise,
      shook their heads sagely, and unanimously cried, &lsquo;Very!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the enthusiasm in Count Smorltork&rsquo;s favour ran very high, his praises
      might have been sung until the end of the festivities, if the four
      something-ean singers had not ranged themselves in front of a small
      apple-tree, to look picturesque, and commenced singing their national
      songs, which appeared by no means difficult of execution, inasmuch as the
      grand secret seemed to be, that three of the something-ean singers should
      grunt, while the fourth howled. This interesting performance having
      concluded amidst the loud plaudits of the whole company, a boy forthwith
      proceeded to entangle himself with the rails of a chair, and to jump over
      it, and crawl under it, and fall down with it, and do everything but sit
      upon it, and then to make a cravat of his legs, and tie them round his
      neck, and then to illustrate the ease with which a human being can be made
      to look like a magnified toad&mdash;all which feats yielded high delight
      and satisfaction to the assembled spectators. After which, the voice of
      Mrs. Pott was heard to chirp faintly forth, something which courtesy
      interpreted into a song, which was all very classical, and strictly in
      character, because Apollo was himself a composer, and composers can very
      seldom sing their own music or anybody else&rsquo;s, either. This was succeeded
      by Mrs. Leo Hunter&rsquo;s recitation of her far-famed &lsquo;Ode to an Expiring
      Frog,&rsquo; which was encored once, and would have been encored twice, if the
      major part of the guests, who thought it was high time to get something to
      eat, had not said that it was perfectly shameful to take advantage of Mrs.
      Hunter&rsquo;s good nature. So although Mrs. Leo Hunter professed her perfect
      willingness to recite the ode again, her kind and considerate friends
      wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it on any account; and the refreshment room being thrown
      open, all the people who had ever been there before, scrambled in with all
      possible despatch&mdash;Mrs. Leo Hunter&rsquo;s usual course of proceedings
      being, to issue cards for a hundred, and breakfast for fifty, or in other
      words to feed only the very particular lions, and let the smaller animals
      take care of themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is Mr. Pott?&rsquo; said Mrs. Leo Hunter, as she placed the aforesaid
      lions around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here I am,&rsquo; said the editor, from the remotest end of the room; far
      beyond all hope of food, unless something was done for him by the hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you come up here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, pray don&rsquo;t mind him,&rsquo; said Mrs. Pott, in the most obliging voice&mdash;&lsquo;you
      give yourself a great deal of unnecessary trouble, Mrs. Hunter. You&rsquo;ll do
      very well there, won&rsquo;t you&mdash;dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly&mdash;love,&rsquo; replied the unhappy Pott, with a grim smile. Alas
      for the knout! The nervous arm that wielded it, with such a gigantic force
      on public characters, was paralysed beneath the glance of the imperious
      Mrs. Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Leo Hunter looked round her in triumph. Count Smorltork was busily
      engaged in taking notes of the contents of the dishes; Mr. Tupman was
      doing the honours of the lobster salad to several lionesses, with a degree
      of grace which no brigand ever exhibited before; Mr. Snodgrass having cut
      out the young gentleman who cut up the books for the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i>,
      was engaged in an impassioned argument with the young lady who did the
      poetry; and Mr. Pickwick was making himself universally agreeable. Nothing
      seemed wanting to render the select circle complete, when Mr. Leo Hunter&mdash;whose
      department on these occasions, was to stand about in doorways, and talk to
      the less important people&mdash;suddenly called out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear; here&rsquo;s Mr. Charles Fitz-Marshall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear,&rsquo; said Mrs. Leo Hunter, &lsquo;how anxiously I have been expecting him.
      Pray make room, to let Mr. Fitz-Marshall pass. Tell Mr. Fitz-Marshall, my
      dear, to come up to me directly, to be scolded for coming so late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Coming, my dear ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; cried a voice, &lsquo;as quick as I can&mdash;crowds of
      people&mdash;full room&mdash;hard work&mdash;very.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s knife and fork fell from his hand. He stared across the
      table at Mr. Tupman, who had dropped his knife and fork, and was looking
      as if he were about to sink into the ground without further notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried the voice, as its owner pushed his way among the last
      five-and-twenty Turks, officers, cavaliers, and Charles the Seconds, that
      remained between him and the table, &lsquo;regular mangle&mdash;Baker&rsquo;s patent&mdash;not
      a crease in my coat, after all this squeezing&mdash;might have &ldquo;got up my
      linen&rdquo; as I came along&mdash;ha! ha! not a bad idea, that&mdash;queer
      thing to have it mangled when it&rsquo;s upon one, though&mdash;trying process&mdash;very.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these broken words, a young man dressed as a naval officer made his
      way up to the table, and presented to the astonished Pickwickians the
      identical form and features of Mr. Alfred Jingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The offender had barely time to take Mrs. Leo Hunter&rsquo;s proffered hand,
      when his eyes encountered the indignant orbs of Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo!&rsquo; said Jingle. &lsquo;Quite forgot&mdash;no directions to postillion&mdash;give
      &lsquo;em at once&mdash;back in a minute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The servant, or Mr. Hunter will do it in a moment, Mr. Fitz-Marshall,&rsquo; 
      said Mrs. Leo Hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;shan&rsquo;t be long&mdash;back in no time,&rsquo; 
      replied Jingle. With these words he disappeared among the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you allow me to ask you, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the excited Mr. Pickwick,
      rising from his seat, &lsquo;who that young man is, and where he resides?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a gentleman of fortune, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Mrs. Leo Hunter, &lsquo;to
      whom I very much want to introduce you. The count will be delighted with
      him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick hastily. &lsquo;His residence&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is at present at the Angel at Bury.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At Bury?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At Bury St. Edmunds, not many miles from here. But dear me, Mr. Pickwick,
      you are not going to leave us; surely Mr. Pickwick you cannot think of
      going so soon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But long before Mrs. Leo Hunter had finished speaking, Mr. Pickwick had
      plunged through the throng, and reached the garden, whither he was shortly
      afterwards joined by Mr. Tupman, who had followed his friend closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s of no use,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman. &lsquo;He has gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;and I will follow him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Follow him! Where?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the Angel at Bury,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, speaking very quickly. &lsquo;How
      do we know whom he is deceiving there? He deceived a worthy man once, and
      we were the innocent cause. He shall not do it again, if I can help it;
      I&rsquo;ll expose him! Sam! Where&rsquo;s my servant?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here you are, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, emerging from a sequestered spot,
      where he had been engaged in discussing a bottle of Madeira, which he had
      abstracted from the breakfast-table an hour or two before. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s your
      servant, Sir. Proud o&rsquo; the title, as the living skellinton said, ven they
      show&rsquo;d him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Follow me instantly,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Tupman, if I stay at Bury, you
      can join me there, when I write. Till then, good-bye!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Remonstrances were useless. Mr. Pickwick was roused, and his mind was made
      up. Mr. Tupman returned to his companions; and in another hour had drowned
      all present recollection of Mr. Alfred Jingle, or Mr. Charles
      Fitz-Marshall, in an exhilarating quadrille and a bottle of champagne. By
      that time, Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller, perched on the outside of a
      stage-coach, were every succeeding minute placing a less and less distance
      between themselves and the good old town of Bury St. Edmunds.

      CHAPTER XVI. TOO FULL OF ADVENTURE TO BE BRIEFLY DESCRIBED
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here is no month
      in the whole year in which nature wears a more beautiful appearance than
      in the month of August. Spring has many beauties, and May is a fresh and
      blooming month, but the charms of this time of year are enhanced by their
      contrast with the winter season. August has no such advantage. It comes
      when we remember nothing but clear skies, green fields, and sweet-smelling
      flowers&mdash;when the recollection of snow, and ice, and bleak winds, has
      faded from our minds as completely as they have disappeared from the earth&mdash;and
      yet what a pleasant time it is! Orchards and cornfields ring with the hum
      of labour; trees bend beneath the thick clusters of rich fruit which bow
      their branches to the ground; and the corn, piled in graceful sheaves, or
      waving in every light breath that sweeps above it, as if it wooed the
      sickle, tinges the landscape with a golden hue. A mellow softness appears
      to hang over the whole earth; the influence of the season seems to extend
      itself to the very wagon, whose slow motion across the well-reaped field
      is perceptible only to the eye, but strikes with no harsh sound upon the
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the coach rolls swiftly past the fields and orchards which skirt the
      road, groups of women and children, piling the fruit in sieves, or
      gathering the scattered ears of corn, pause for an instant from their
      labour, and shading the sun-burned face with a still browner hand, gaze
      upon the passengers with curious eyes, while some stout urchin, too small
      to work, but too mischievous to be left at home, scrambles over the side
      of the basket in which he has been deposited for security, and kicks and
      screams with delight. The reaper stops in his work, and stands with folded
      arms, looking at the vehicle as it whirls past; and the rough cart-horses
      bestow a sleepy glance upon the smart coach team, which says as plainly as
      a horse&rsquo;s glance can, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all very fine to look at, but slow going, over
      a heavy field, is better than warm work like that, upon a dusty road,
      after all.&rsquo; You cast a look behind you, as you turn a corner of the road.
      The women and children have resumed their labour; the reaper once more
      stoops to his work; the cart-horses have moved on; and all are again in
      motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The influence of a scene like this, was not lost upon the well-regulated
      mind of Mr. Pickwick. Intent upon the resolution he had formed, of
      exposing the real character of the nefarious Jingle, in any quarter in
      which he might be pursuing his fraudulent designs, he sat at first
      taciturn and contemplative, brooding over the means by which his purpose
      could be best attained. By degrees his attention grew more and more
      attracted by the objects around him; and at last he derived as much
      enjoyment from the ride, as if it had been undertaken for the pleasantest
      reason in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Delightful prospect, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beats the chimbley-pots, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, touching his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose you have hardly seen anything but chimney-pots and bricks and
      mortar all your life, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I worn&rsquo;t always a boots, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, with a shake of the head.
      &lsquo;I wos a vaginer&rsquo;s boy, once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When was that?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I wos first pitched neck and crop into the world, to play at
      leap-frog with its troubles,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;I wos a carrier&rsquo;s boy at
      startin&rsquo;; then a vaginer&rsquo;s, then a helper, then a boots. Now I&rsquo;m a
      gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n&rsquo;s servant. I shall be a gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n myself one of these days,
      perhaps, with a pipe in my mouth, and a summer-house in the back-garden.
      Who knows? I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised for one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are quite a philosopher, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It runs in the family, I b&rsquo;lieve, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller. &lsquo;My father&rsquo;s
      wery much in that line now. If my mother-in-law blows him up, he whistles.
      She flies in a passion, and breaks his pipe; he steps out, and gets
      another. Then she screams wery loud, and falls into &lsquo;sterics; and he
      smokes wery comfortably till she comes to agin. That&rsquo;s philosophy, Sir,
      ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A very good substitute for it, at all events,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick,
      laughing. &lsquo;It must have been of great service to you, in the course of
      your rambling life, Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Service, sir,&rsquo; exclaimed Sam. &lsquo;You may say that. Arter I run away from
      the carrier, and afore I took up with the vaginer, I had unfurnished
      lodgin&rsquo;s for a fortnight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unfurnished lodgings?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;the dry arches of Waterloo Bridge. Fine sleeping-place&mdash;vithin
      ten minutes&rsquo; walk of all the public offices&mdash;only if there is any
      objection to it, it is that the sitivation&rsquo;s rayther too airy. I see some
      queer sights there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, I suppose you did,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with an air of considerable
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sights, sir,&rsquo; resumed Mr. Weller, &lsquo;as &lsquo;ud penetrate your benevolent
      heart, and come out on the other side. You don&rsquo;t see the reg&rsquo;lar wagrants
      there; trust &lsquo;em, they knows better than that. Young beggars, male and
      female, as hasn&rsquo;t made a rise in their profession, takes up their quarters
      there sometimes; but it&rsquo;s generally the worn-out, starving, houseless
      creeturs as roll themselves in the dark corners o&rsquo; them lonesome places&mdash;poor
      creeturs as ain&rsquo;t up to the twopenny rope.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And pray, Sam, what is the twopenny rope?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The twopenny rope, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, &lsquo;is just a cheap lodgin&rsquo; 
      house, where the beds is twopence a night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do they call a bed a rope for?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless your innocence, sir, that ain&rsquo;t it,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;Ven the lady and
      gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n as keeps the hot-el first begun business, they used to make the
      beds on the floor; but this wouldn&rsquo;t do at no price, &lsquo;cos instead o&rsquo; 
      taking a moderate twopenn&rsquo;orth o&rsquo; sleep, the lodgers used to lie there
      half the day. So now they has two ropes, &lsquo;bout six foot apart, and three
      from the floor, which goes right down the room; and the beds are made of
      slips of coarse sacking, stretched across &lsquo;em.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, &lsquo;the adwantage o&rsquo; the plan&rsquo;s hobvious. At six
      o&rsquo;clock every mornin&rsquo; they let&rsquo;s go the ropes at one end, and down falls
      the lodgers. Consequence is, that being thoroughly waked, they get up wery
      quietly, and walk away!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beg your pardon, sir,&rsquo; said Sam, suddenly breaking off in his loquacious
      discourse. &lsquo;Is this Bury St. Edmunds?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coach rattled through the well-paved streets of a handsome little
      town, of thriving and cleanly appearance, and stopped before a large inn
      situated in a wide open street, nearly facing the old abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And this,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking up. &lsquo;Is the Angel! We alight here,
      Sam. But some caution is necessary. Order a private room, and do not
      mention my name. You understand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Right as a trivet, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, with a wink of intelligence;
      and having dragged Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s portmanteau from the hind boot, into
      which it had been hastily thrown when they joined the coach at Eatanswill,
      Mr. Weller disappeared on his errand. A private room was speedily engaged;
      and into it Mr. Pickwick was ushered without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;the first thing to be done is to&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Order dinner, Sir,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Weller. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s wery late, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, so it is,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking at his watch. &lsquo;You are right,
      Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if I might adwise, Sir,&rsquo; added Mr. Weller, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d just have a good
      night&rsquo;s rest arterwards, and not begin inquiring arter this here deep &lsquo;un
      till the mornin&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; so refreshen&rsquo; as sleep, sir, as the
      servant girl said afore she drank the egg-cupful of laudanum.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you are right, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;But I must first
      ascertain that he is in the house, and not likely to go away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave that to me, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;Let me order you a snug little dinner,
      and make my inquiries below while it&rsquo;s a-getting ready; I could worm ev&rsquo;ry
      secret out O&rsquo; the boots&rsquo;s heart, in five minutes, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Do so,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; and Mr. Weller at once retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour, Mr. Pickwick was seated at a very satisfactory dinner;
      and in three-quarters Mr. Weller returned with the intelligence that Mr.
      Charles Fitz-Marshall had ordered his private room to be retained for him,
      until further notice. He was going to spend the evening at some private
      house in the neighbourhood, had ordered the boots to sit up until his
      return, and had taken his servant with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, sir,&rsquo; argued Mr. Weller, when he had concluded his report, &lsquo;if I can
      get a talk with this here servant in the mornin&rsquo;, he&rsquo;ll tell me all his
      master&rsquo;s concerns.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know that?&rsquo; interposed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless your heart, sir, servants always do,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, ah, I forgot that,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you can arrange what&rsquo;s best to be done, sir, and we can act
      accordingly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As it appeared that this was the best arrangement that could be made, it
      was finally agreed upon. Mr. Weller, by his master&rsquo;s permission, retired
      to spend the evening in his own way; and was shortly afterwards elected,
      by the unanimous voice of the assembled company, into the taproom chair,
      in which honourable post he acquitted himself so much to the satisfaction
      of the gentlemen-frequenters, that their roars of laughter and approbation
      penetrated to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s bedroom, and shortened the term of his
      natural rest by at least three hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on the ensuing morning, Mr. Weller was dispelling all the feverish
      remains of the previous evening&rsquo;s conviviality, through the
      instrumentality of a halfpenny shower-bath (having induced a young
      gentleman attached to the stable department, by the offer of that coin, to
      pump over his head and face, until he was perfectly restored), when he was
      attracted by the appearance of a young fellow in mulberry-coloured livery,
      who was sitting on a bench in the yard, reading what appeared to be a
      hymn-book, with an air of deep abstraction, but who occasionally stole a
      glance at the individual under the pump, as if he took some interest in
      his proceedings, nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a rum &lsquo;un to look at, you are!&rsquo; thought Mr. Weller, the first time
      his eyes encountered the glance of the stranger in the mulberry suit, who
      had a large, sallow, ugly face, very sunken eyes, and a gigantic head,
      from which depended a quantity of lank black hair. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a rum &lsquo;un!&rsquo; 
      thought Mr. Weller; and thinking this, he went on washing himself, and
      thought no more about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the man kept glancing from his hymn-book to Sam, and from Sam to his
      hymn-book, as if he wanted to open a conversation. So at last, Sam, by way
      of giving him an opportunity, said with a familiar nod&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How are you, governor?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am happy to say, I am pretty well, Sir,&rsquo; said the man, speaking with
      great deliberation, and closing the book. &lsquo;I hope you are the same, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, if I felt less like a walking brandy-bottle I shouldn&rsquo;t be quite so
      staggery this mornin&rsquo;,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;Are you stoppin&rsquo; in this house, old
      &lsquo;un?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mulberry man replied in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How was it you worn&rsquo;t one of us, last night?&rsquo; inquired Sam, scrubbing his
      face with the towel. &lsquo;You seem one of the jolly sort&mdash;looks as
      conwivial as a live trout in a lime basket,&rsquo; added Mr. Weller, in an
      undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was out last night with my master,&rsquo; replied the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller, colouring up very red with sudden
      excitement, and the friction of the towel combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fitz-Marshall,&rsquo; said the mulberry man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give us your hand,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, advancing; &lsquo;I should like to know
      you. I like your appearance, old fellow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that is very strange,&rsquo; said the mulberry man, with great simplicity
      of manner. &lsquo;I like yours so much, that I wanted to speak to you, from the
      very first moment I saw you under the pump.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you though?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word. Now, isn&rsquo;t that curious?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery sing&rsquo;ler,&rsquo; said Sam, inwardly congratulating himself upon the
      softness of the stranger. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your name, my patriarch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Job.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a wery good name it is; only one I know that ain&rsquo;t got a nickname to
      it. What&rsquo;s the other name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trotter,&rsquo; said the stranger. &lsquo;What is yours?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam bore in mind his master&rsquo;s caution, and replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name&rsquo;s Walker; my master&rsquo;s name&rsquo;s Wilkins. Will you take a drop o&rsquo; 
      somethin&rsquo; this mornin&rsquo;, Mr. Trotter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Trotter acquiesced in this agreeable proposal; and having deposited
      his book in his coat pocket, accompanied Mr. Weller to the tap, where they
      were soon occupied in discussing an exhilarating compound, formed by
      mixing together, in a pewter vessel, certain quantities of British
      Hollands and the fragrant essence of the clove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what sort of a place have you got?&rsquo; inquired Sam, as he filled his
      companion&rsquo;s glass, for the second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bad,&rsquo; said Job, smacking his lips, &lsquo;very bad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do, indeed. Worse than that, my master&rsquo;s going to be married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; and worse than that, too, he&rsquo;s going to run away with an immense
      rich heiress, from boarding-school.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a dragon!&rsquo; said Sam, refilling his companion&rsquo;s glass. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s some
      boarding-school in this town, I suppose, ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; Now, although this
      question was put in the most careless tone imaginable, Mr. Job Trotter
      plainly showed by gestures that he perceived his new friend&rsquo;s anxiety to
      draw forth an answer to it. He emptied his glass, looked mysteriously at
      his companion, winked both of his small eyes, one after the other, and
      finally made a motion with his arm, as if he were working an imaginary
      pump-handle; thereby intimating that he (Mr. Trotter) considered himself
      as undergoing the process of being pumped by Mr. Samuel Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Mr. Trotter, in conclusion, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s not to be told to
      everybody. That is a secret&mdash;a great secret, Mr. Walker.&rsquo; As the
      mulberry man said this, he turned his glass upside down, by way of
      reminding his companion that he had nothing left wherewith to slake his
      thirst. Sam observed the hint; and feeling the delicate manner in which it
      was conveyed, ordered the pewter vessel to be refilled, whereat the small
      eyes of the mulberry man glistened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so it&rsquo;s a secret?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should rather suspect it was,&rsquo; said the mulberry man, sipping his
      liquor, with a complacent face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose your mas&rsquo;r&rsquo;s wery rich?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Trotter smiled, and holding his glass in his left hand, gave four
      distinct slaps on the pockets of his mulberry indescribables with his
      right, as if to intimate that his master might have done the same without
      alarming anybody much by the chinking of coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the game, is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mulberry man nodded significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and don&rsquo;t you think, old feller,&rsquo; remonstrated Mr. Weller, &lsquo;that if
      you let your master take in this here young lady, you&rsquo;re a precious
      rascal?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know that,&rsquo; said Job Trotter, turning upon his companion a countenance
      of deep contrition, and groaning slightly, &lsquo;I know that, and that&rsquo;s what
      it is that preys upon my mind. But what am I to do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do!&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;di-wulge to the missis, and give up your master.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;d believe me?&rsquo; replied Job Trotter. &lsquo;The young lady&rsquo;s considered the
      very picture of innocence and discretion. She&rsquo;d deny it, and so would my
      master. Who&rsquo;d believe me? I should lose my place, and get indicted for a
      conspiracy, or some such thing; that&rsquo;s all I should take by my motion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; in that,&rsquo; said Sam, ruminating; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; in
      that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I knew any respectable gentleman who would take the matter up,&rsquo; 
      continued Mr. Trotter. &lsquo;I might have some hope of preventing the
      elopement; but there&rsquo;s the same difficulty, Mr. Walker, just the same. I
      know no gentleman in this strange place; and ten to one if I did, whether
      he would believe my story.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come this way,&rsquo; said Sam, suddenly jumping up, and grasping the mulberry
      man by the arm. &lsquo;My mas&rsquo;r&rsquo;s the man you want, I see.&rsquo; And after a slight
      resistance on the part of Job Trotter, Sam led his newly-found friend to
      the apartment of Mr. Pickwick, to whom he presented him, together with a
      brief summary of the dialogue we have just repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very sorry to betray my master, sir,&rsquo; said Job Trotter, applying to
      his eyes a pink checked pocket-handkerchief about six inches square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The feeling does you a great deal of honour,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;but
      it is your duty, nevertheless.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it is my duty, Sir,&rsquo; replied Job, with great emotion. &lsquo;We should
      all try to discharge our duty, Sir, and I humbly endeavour to discharge
      mine, Sir; but it is a hard trial to betray a master, Sir, whose clothes
      you wear, and whose bread you eat, even though he is a scoundrel, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a very good fellow,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, much affected; &lsquo;an honest
      fellow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; interposed Sam, who had witnessed Mr. Trotter&rsquo;s tears with
      considerable impatience, &lsquo;blow this &lsquo;ere water-cart bis&rsquo;ness. It won&rsquo;t do
      no good, this won&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick reproachfully. &lsquo;I am sorry to find that you have
      so little respect for this young man&rsquo;s feelings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His feelin&rsquo;s is all wery well, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; &lsquo;and as they&rsquo;re
      so wery fine, and it&rsquo;s a pity he should lose &lsquo;em, I think he&rsquo;d better keep
      &lsquo;em in his own buzzum, than let &lsquo;em ewaporate in hot water, &lsquo;specially as
      they do no good. Tears never yet wound up a clock, or worked a steam
      ingin&rsquo;. The next time you go out to a smoking party, young fellow, fill
      your pipe with that &lsquo;ere reflection; and for the present just put that bit
      of pink gingham into your pocket. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t so handsome that you need keep
      waving it about, as if you was a tight-rope dancer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My man is in the right,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, accosting Job, &lsquo;although his
      mode of expressing his opinion is somewhat homely, and occasionally
      incomprehensible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is, sir, very right,&rsquo; said Mr. Trotter, &lsquo;and I will give way no
      longer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Very well,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Now, where is this boarding-school?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a large, old, red brick house, just outside the town, Sir,&rsquo; replied
      Job Trotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And when,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick&mdash;&lsquo;when is this villainous design to be
      carried into execution&mdash;when is this elopement to take place?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-night, Sir,&rsquo; replied Job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-night!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This very night, sir,&rsquo; replied Job Trotter. &lsquo;That is what alarms me so
      much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Instant measures must be taken,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;I will see the lady
      who keeps the establishment immediately.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, Sir,&rsquo; said Job, &lsquo;but that course of proceeding will
      never do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My master, sir, is a very artful man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know he is,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he has so wound himself round the old lady&rsquo;s heart, Sir,&rsquo; resumed
      Job, &lsquo;that she would believe nothing to his prejudice, if you went down on
      your bare knees, and swore it; especially as you have no proof but the
      word of a servant, who, for anything she knows (and my master would be
      sure to say so), was discharged for some fault, and does this in revenge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What had better be done, then?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing but taking him in the very act of eloping, will convince the old
      lady, sir,&rsquo; replied Job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All them old cats <i>will </i>run their heads agin milestones,&rsquo; observed
      Mr. Weller, in a parenthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But this taking him in the very act of elopement, would be a very
      difficult thing to accomplish, I fear,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Trotter, after a few moments&rsquo; reflection. &lsquo;I
      think it might be very easily done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How?&rsquo; was Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; replied Mr. Trotter, &lsquo;my master and I, being in the confidence of
      the two servants, will be secreted in the kitchen at ten o&rsquo;clock. When the
      family have retired to rest, we shall come out of the kitchen, and the
      young lady out of her bedroom. A post-chaise will be waiting, and away we
      go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir, I have been thinking that if you were in waiting in the garden
      behind, alone&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alone,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Why alone?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought it very natural,&rsquo; replied Job, &lsquo;that the old lady wouldn&rsquo;t like
      such an unpleasant discovery to be made before more persons than can
      possibly be helped. The young lady, too, sir&mdash;consider her feelings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are very right,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;The consideration evinces your
      delicacy of feeling. Go on; you are very right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir, I have been thinking that if you were waiting in the back
      garden alone, and I was to let you in, at the door which opens into it,
      from the end of the passage, at exactly half-past eleven o&rsquo;clock, you
      would be just in the very moment of time to assist me in frustrating the
      designs of this bad man, by whom I have been unfortunately ensnared.&rsquo; Here
      Mr. Trotter sighed deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t distress yourself on that account,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;if he had
      one grain of the delicacy of feeling which distinguishes you, humble as
      your station is, I should have some hopes of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Job Trotter bowed low; and in spite of Mr. Weller&rsquo;s previous remonstrance,
      the tears again rose to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never see such a feller,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;Blessed if I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s got
      a main in his head as is always turned on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with great severity, &lsquo;hold your tongue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery well, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like this plan,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, after deep meditation. &lsquo;Why
      cannot I communicate with the young lady&rsquo;s friends?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because they live one hundred miles from here, sir,&rsquo; responded Job
      Trotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a clincher,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then this garden,&rsquo; resumed Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;How am I to get into it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wall is very low, sir, and your servant will give you a leg up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My servant will give me a leg up,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Pickwick mechanically.
      &lsquo;You will be sure to be near this door that you speak of?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You cannot mistake it, Sir; it&rsquo;s the only one that opens into the garden.
      Tap at it when you hear the clock strike, and I will open it instantly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like the plan,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;but as I see no other, and as
      the happiness of this young lady&rsquo;s whole life is at stake, I adopt it. I
      shall be sure to be there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, for the second time, did Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s innate good-feeling involve
      him in an enterprise from which he would most willingly have stood aloof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the name of the house?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Westgate House, Sir. You turn a little to the right when you get to the
      end of the town; it stands by itself, some little distance off the high
      road, with the name on a brass plate on the gate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;I observed it once before, when I was in
      this town. You may depend upon me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Trotter made another bow, and turned to depart, when Mr. Pickwick
      thrust a guinea into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a fine fellow,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;and I admire your goodness of
      heart. No thanks. Remember&mdash;eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no fear of my forgetting it, sir,&rsquo; replied Job Trotter. With
      these words he left the room, followed by Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; said the latter, &lsquo;not a bad notion that &lsquo;ere crying. I&rsquo;d cry like
      a rain-water spout in a shower on such good terms. How do you do it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It comes from the heart, Mr. Walker,&rsquo; replied Job solemnly.
      &lsquo;Good-morning, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a soft customer, you are; we&rsquo;ve got it all out o&rsquo; you, anyhow,&rsquo; 
      thought Mr. Weller, as Job walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot state the precise nature of the thoughts which passed through
      Mr. Trotter&rsquo;s mind, because we don&rsquo;t know what they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day wore on, evening came, and at a little before ten o&rsquo;clock Sam
      Weller reported that Mr. Jingle and Job had gone out together, that their
      luggage was packed up, and that they had ordered a chaise. The plot was
      evidently in execution, as Mr. Trotter had foretold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-past ten o&rsquo;clock arrived, and it was time for Mr. Pickwick to issue
      forth on his delicate errand. Resisting Sam&rsquo;s tender of his greatcoat, in
      order that he might have no encumbrance in scaling the wall, he set forth,
      followed by his attendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a bright moon, but it was behind the clouds. It was a fine dry
      night, but it was most uncommonly dark. Paths, hedges, fields, houses, and
      trees, were enveloped in one deep shade. The atmosphere was hot and
      sultry, the summer lightning quivered faintly on the verge of the horizon,
      and was the only sight that varied the dull gloom in which everything was
      wrapped&mdash;sound there was none, except the distant barking of some
      restless house-dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found the house, read the brass plate, walked round the wall, and
      stopped at that portion of it which divided them from the bottom of the
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will return to the inn, Sam, when you have assisted me over,&rsquo; said
      Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery well, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you will sit up, till I return.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cert&rsquo;nly, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take hold of my leg; and, when I say &ldquo;Over,&rdquo; raise me gently.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having settled these preliminaries, Mr. Pickwick grasped the top of the
      wall, and gave the word &lsquo;Over,&rsquo; which was literally obeyed. Whether his
      body partook in some degree of the elasticity of his mind, or whether Mr.
      Weller&rsquo;s notions of a gentle push were of a somewhat rougher description
      than Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s, the immediate effect of his assistance was to jerk
      that immortal gentleman completely over the wall on to the bed beneath,
      where, after crushing three gooseberry-bushes and a rose-tree, he finally
      alighted at full length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hurt yourself, I hope, Sir?&rsquo; said Sam, in a loud whisper, as
      soon as he had recovered from the surprise consequent upon the mysterious
      disappearance of his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not hurt <i>myself</i>, Sam, certainly,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick,
      from the other side of the wall, &lsquo;but I rather think that <i>you </i>have
      hurt me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope not, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, rising, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s nothing but a few
      scratches. Go away, or we shall be overheard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With stealthy steps Sam Weller departed, leaving Mr. Pickwick alone in the
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lights occasionally appeared in the different windows of the house, or
      glanced from the staircases, as if the inmates were retiring to rest. Not
      caring to go too near the door, until the appointed time, Mr. Pickwick
      crouched into an angle of the wall, and awaited its arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a situation which might well have depressed the spirits of many a
      man. Mr. Pickwick, however, felt neither depression nor misgiving. He knew
      that his purpose was in the main a good one, and he placed implicit
      reliance on the high-minded Job. It was dull, certainly; not to say
      dreary; but a contemplative man can always employ himself in meditation.
      Mr. Pickwick had meditated himself into a doze, when he was roused by the
      chimes of the neighbouring church ringing out the hour&mdash;half-past
      eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the time,&rsquo; thought Mr. Pickwick, getting cautiously on his feet.
      He looked up at the house. The lights had disappeared, and the shutters
      were closed&mdash;all in bed, no doubt. He walked on tiptoe to the door,
      and gave a gentle tap. Two or three minutes passing without any reply, he
      gave another tap rather louder, and then another rather louder than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the sound of feet was audible upon the stairs, and then the
      light of a candle shone through the keyhole of the door. There was a good
      deal of unchaining and unbolting, and the door was slowly opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the door opened outwards; and as the door opened wider and wider, Mr.
      Pickwick receded behind it, more and more. What was his astonishment when
      he just peeped out, by way of caution, to see that the person who had
      opened it was&mdash;not Job Trotter, but a servant-girl with a candle in
      her hand! Mr. Pickwick drew in his head again, with the swiftness
      displayed by that admirable melodramatic performer, Punch, when he lies in
      wait for the flat-headed comedian with the tin box of music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must have been the cat, Sarah,&rsquo; said the girl, addressing herself to
      some one in the house. &lsquo;Puss, puss, puss,&mdash;tit, tit, tit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But no animal being decoyed by these blandishments, the girl slowly closed
      the door, and re-fastened it; leaving Mr. Pickwick drawn up straight
      against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is very curious,&rsquo; thought Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;They are sitting up beyond
      their usual hour, I suppose. Extremely unfortunate, that they should have
      chosen this night, of all others, for such a purpose&mdash;exceedingly.&rsquo; 
      And with these thoughts, Mr. Pickwick cautiously retired to the angle of
      the wall in which he had been before ensconced; waiting until such time as
      he might deem it safe to repeat the signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been here five minutes, when a vivid flash of lightning was
      followed by a loud peal of thunder that crashed and rolled away in the
      distance with a terrific noise&mdash;then came another flash of lightning,
      brighter than the other, and a second peal of thunder louder than the
      first; and then down came the rain, with a force and fury that swept
      everything before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was perfectly aware that a tree is a very dangerous neighbour
      in a thunderstorm. He had a tree on his right, a tree on his left, a third
      before him, and a fourth behind. If he remained where he was, he might
      fall the victim of an accident; if he showed himself in the centre of the
      garden, he might be consigned to a constable. Once or twice he tried to
      scale the wall, but having no other legs this time, than those with which
      Nature had furnished him, the only effect of his struggles was to inflict
      a variety of very unpleasant gratings on his knees and shins, and to throw
      him into a state of the most profuse perspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a dreadful situation,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, pausing to wipe his brow
      after this exercise. He looked up at the house&mdash;all was dark. They
      must be gone to bed now. He would try the signal again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on tiptoe across the moist gravel, and tapped at the door. He
      held his breath, and listened at the key-hole. No reply: very odd. Another
      knock. He listened again. There was a low whispering inside, and then a
      voice cried&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not Job,&rsquo; thought Mr. Pickwick, hastily drawing himself straight
      up against the wall again. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely had time to form this conclusion, when a window above
      stairs was thrown up, and three or four female voices repeated the query&mdash;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s
      there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick dared not move hand or foot. It was clear that the whole
      establishment was roused. He made up his mind to remain where he was,
      until the alarm had subsided; and then by a supernatural effort, to get
      over the wall, or perish in the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s determinations, this was the best that could be
      made under the circumstances; but, unfortunately, it was founded upon the
      assumption that they would not venture to open the door again. What was
      his discomfiture, when he heard the chain and bolts withdrawn, and saw the
      door slowly opening, wider and wider! He retreated into the corner, step
      by step; but do what he would, the interposition of his own person,
      prevented its being opened to its utmost width.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; screamed a numerous chorus of treble voices from the
      staircase inside, consisting of the spinster lady of the establishment,
      three teachers, five female servants, and thirty boarders, all
      half-dressed and in a forest of curl-papers.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/0324m.jpg" alt="0324m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0324.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Of course Mr. Pickwick didn&rsquo;t say who was there: and then the burden of
      the chorus changed into&mdash;&lsquo;Lor! I am so frightened.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cook,&rsquo; said the lady abbess, who took care to be on the top stair, the
      very last of the group&mdash;&lsquo;cook, why don&rsquo;t you go a little way into the
      garden?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Please, ma&rsquo;am, I don&rsquo;t like,&rsquo; responded the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor, what a stupid thing that cook is!&rsquo; said the thirty boarders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cook,&rsquo; said the lady abbess, with great dignity; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t answer me, if you
      please. I insist upon your looking into the garden immediately.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the cook began to cry, and the housemaid said it was &lsquo;a shame!&rsquo; for
      which partisanship she received a month&rsquo;s warning on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you hear, cook?&rsquo; said the lady abbess, stamping her foot impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear your missis, cook?&rsquo; said the three teachers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What an impudent thing that cook is!&rsquo; said the thirty boarders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate cook, thus strongly urged, advanced a step or two, and
      holding her candle just where it prevented her from seeing at all,
      declared there was nothing there, and it must have been the wind. The door
      was just going to be closed in consequence, when an inquisitive boarder,
      who had been peeping between the hinges, set up a fearful screaming, which
      called back the cook and housemaid, and all the more adventurous, in no
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter with Miss Smithers?&rsquo; said the lady abbess, as the
      aforesaid Miss Smithers proceeded to go into hysterics of four young lady
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor, Miss Smithers, dear,&rsquo; said the other nine-and-twenty boarders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the man&mdash;the man&mdash;behind the door!&rsquo; screamed Miss Smithers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady abbess no sooner heard this appalling cry, than she retreated to
      her own bedroom, double-locked the door, and fainted away comfortably. The
      boarders, and the teachers, and the servants, fell back upon the stairs,
      and upon each other; and never was such a screaming, and fainting, and
      struggling beheld. In the midst of the tumult, Mr. Pickwick emerged from
      his concealment, and presented himself amongst them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ladies&mdash;dear ladies,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh. he says we&rsquo;re dear,&rsquo; cried the oldest and ugliest teacher. &lsquo;Oh, the
      wretch!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ladies,&rsquo; roared Mr. Pickwick, rendered desperate by the danger of his
      situation. &lsquo;Hear me. I am no robber. I want the lady of the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, what a ferocious monster!&rsquo; screamed another teacher. &lsquo;He wants Miss
      Tomkins.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there was a general scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ring the alarm bell, somebody!&rsquo; cried a dozen voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; shouted Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Look at me. Do I look like a
      robber! My dear ladies&mdash;you may bind me hand and leg, or lock me up
      in a closet, if you like. Only hear what I have got to say&mdash;only hear
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did you come in our garden?&rsquo; faltered the housemaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Call the lady of the house, and I&rsquo;ll tell her everything,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Pickwick, exerting his lungs to the utmost pitch. &lsquo;Call her&mdash;only be
      quiet, and call her, and you shall hear everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s appearance, or it might have been his
      manner, or it might have been the temptation&mdash;irresistible to a
      female mind&mdash;of hearing something at present enveloped in mystery,
      that reduced the more reasonable portion of the establishment (some four
      individuals) to a state of comparative quiet. By them it was proposed, as
      a test of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s sincerity, that he should immediately submit to
      personal restraint; and that gentleman having consented to hold a
      conference with Miss Tomkins, from the interior of a closet in which the
      day boarders hung their bonnets and sandwich-bags, he at once stepped into
      it, of his own accord, and was securely locked in. This revived the
      others; and Miss Tomkins having been brought to, and brought down, the
      conference began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you do in my garden, man?&rsquo; said Miss Tomkins, in a faint voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came to warn you that one of your young ladies was going to elope
      to-night,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, from the interior of the closet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elope!&rsquo; exclaimed Miss Tomkins, the three teachers, the thirty boarders,
      and the five servants. &lsquo;Who with?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Your friend, Mr. Charles Fitz-Marshall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>My</i> friend! I don&rsquo;t know any such person.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Mr. Jingle, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never heard the name in my life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, I have been deceived, and deluded,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;I have been
      the victim of a conspiracy&mdash;a foul and base conspiracy. Send to the
      Angel, my dear ma&rsquo;am, if you don&rsquo;t believe me. Send to the Angel for Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s manservant, I implore you, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must be respectable&mdash;he keeps a manservant,&rsquo; said Miss Tomkins to
      the writing and ciphering governess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion, Miss Tomkins,&rsquo; said the writing and ciphering governess,
      &lsquo;that his manservant keeps him, I think he&rsquo;s a madman, Miss Tomkins, and
      the other&rsquo;s his keeper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you are very right, Miss Gwynn,&rsquo; responded Miss Tomkins. &lsquo;Let two
      of the servants repair to the Angel, and let the others remain here, to
      protect us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So two of the servants were despatched to the Angel in search of Mr.
      Samuel Weller; and the remaining three stopped behind to protect Miss
      Tomkins, and the three teachers, and the thirty boarders. And Mr. Pickwick
      sat down in the closet, beneath a grove of sandwich-bags, and awaited the
      return of the messengers, with all the philosophy and fortitude he could
      summon to his aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour and a half elapsed before they came back, and when they did come,
      Mr. Pickwick recognised, in addition to the voice of Mr. Samuel Weller,
      two other voices, the tones of which struck familiarly on his ear; but
      whose they were, he could not for the life of him call to mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very brief conversation ensued. The door was unlocked. Mr. Pickwick
      stepped out of the closet, and found himself in the presence of the whole
      establishment of Westgate House, Mr Samuel Weller, and&mdash;old Wardle,
      and his destined son-in-law, Mr. Trundle!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear friend,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, running forward and grasping Wardle&rsquo;s
      hand, &lsquo;my dear friend, pray, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, explain to this lady the
      unfortunate and dreadful situation in which I am placed. You must have
      heard it from my servant; say, at all events, my dear fellow, that I am
      neither a robber nor a madman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have said so, my dear friend. I have said so already,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Wardle, shaking the right hand of his friend, while Mr. Trundle shook the
      left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And whoever says, or has said, he is,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Weller, stepping
      forward, &lsquo;says that which is not the truth, but so far from it, on the
      contrary, quite the rewerse. And if there&rsquo;s any number o&rsquo; men on these
      here premises as has said so, I shall be wery happy to give &lsquo;em all a wery
      convincing proof o&rsquo; their being mistaken, in this here wery room, if these
      wery respectable ladies &lsquo;ll have the goodness to retire, and order &lsquo;em up,
      one at a time.&rsquo; Having delivered this defiance with great volubility, Mr.
      Weller struck his open palm emphatically with his clenched fist, and
      winked pleasantly on Miss Tomkins, the intensity of whose horror at his
      supposing it within the bounds of possibility that there could be any men
      on the premises of Westgate House Establishment for Young Ladies, it is
      impossible to describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s explanation having already been partially made, was soon
      concluded. But neither in the course of his walk home with his friends,
      nor afterwards when seated before a blazing fire at the supper he so much
      needed, could a single observation be drawn from him. He seemed bewildered
      and amazed. Once, and only once, he turned round to Mr. Wardle, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did you come here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trundle and I came down here, for some good shooting on the first,&rsquo; 
      replied Wardle. &lsquo;We arrived to-night, and were astonished to hear from
      your servant that you were here too. But I am glad you are,&rsquo; said the old
      fellow, slapping him on the back&mdash;&lsquo;I am glad you are. We shall have a
      jovial party on the first, and we&rsquo;ll give Winkle another chance&mdash;eh,
      old boy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick made no reply, he did not even ask after his friends at
      Dingley Dell, and shortly afterwards retired for the night, desiring Sam
      to fetch his candle when he rung.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell did ring in due course, and Mr. Weller presented himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking out from under the bed-clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick paused, and Mr. Weller snuffed the candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick again, as if with a desperate effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is that Trotter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Job, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gone, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With his master, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friend or master, or whatever he is, he&rsquo;s gone with him,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Weller. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a pair on &lsquo;em, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jingle suspected my design, and set that fellow on you, with this story,
      I suppose?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, half choking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just that, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was all false, of course?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Reg&rsquo;lar do, sir; artful dodge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll escape us quite so easily the next time, Sam!&rsquo; said
      Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think he will, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whenever I meet that Jingle again, wherever it is,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
      raising himself in bed, and indenting his pillow with a tremendous blow,
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll inflict personal chastisement on him, in addition to the exposure he
      so richly merits. I will, or my name is not Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And venever I catches hold o&rsquo; that there melan-cholly chap with the black
      hair,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;if I don&rsquo;t bring some real water into his eyes, for once
      in a way, my name ain&rsquo;t Weller. Good-night, Sir!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER XVII. SHOWING THAT AN ATTACK OF RHEUMATISM, IN SOME CASES, ACTS AS
      A QUICKENER TO INVENTIVE GENIUS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he constitution of
      Mr. Pickwick, though able to sustain a very considerable amount of
      exertion and fatigue, was not proof against such a combination of attacks
      as he had undergone on the memorable night, recorded in the last chapter.
      The process of being washed in the night air, and rough-dried in a closet,
      is as dangerous as it is peculiar. Mr. Pickwick was laid up with an attack
      of rheumatism.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although the bodily powers of the great man were thus impaired, his
      mental energies retained their pristine vigour. His spirits were elastic;
      his good-humour was restored. Even the vexation consequent upon his recent
      adventure had vanished from his mind; and he could join in the hearty
      laughter, which any allusion to it excited in Mr. Wardle, without anger
      and without embarrassment. Nay, more. During the two days Mr. Pickwick was
      confined to bed, Sam was his constant attendant. On the first, he
      endeavoured to amuse his master by anecdote and conversation; on the
      second, Mr. Pickwick demanded his writing-desk, and pen and ink, and was
      deeply engaged during the whole day. On the third, being able to sit up in
      his bedchamber, he despatched his valet with a message to Mr. Wardle and
      Mr. Trundle, intimating that if they would take their wine there, that
      evening, they would greatly oblige him. The invitation was most willingly
      accepted; and when they were seated over their wine, Mr. Pickwick, with
      sundry blushes, produced the following little tale, as having been
      &lsquo;edited&rsquo; by himself, during his recent indisposition, from his notes of
      Mr. Weller&rsquo;s unsophisticated recital.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  THE PARISH CLERK
  A TALE OF TRUE LOVE
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Once upon a time, in a very small country town, at a considerable
      distance from London, there lived a little man named Nathaniel Pipkin, who
      was the parish clerk of the little town, and lived in a little house in
      the little High Street, within ten minutes&rsquo; walk from the little church;
      and who was to be found every day, from nine till four, teaching a little
      learning to the little boys. Nathaniel Pipkin was a harmless, inoffensive,
      good-natured being, with a turned-up nose, and rather turned-in legs, a
      cast in his eye, and a halt in his gait; and he divided his time between
      the church and his school, verily believing that there existed not, on the
      face of the earth, so clever a man as the curate, so imposing an apartment
      as the vestry-room, or so well-ordered a seminary as his own. Once, and
      only once, in his life, Nathaniel Pipkin had seen a bishop&mdash;a real
      bishop, with his arms in lawn sleeves, and his head in a wig. He had seen
      him walk, and heard him talk, at a confirmation, on which momentous
      occasion Nathaniel Pipkin was so overcome with reverence and awe, when the
      aforesaid bishop laid his hand on his head, that he fainted right clean
      away, and was borne out of church in the arms of the beadle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This was a great event, a tremendous era, in Nathaniel Pipkin&rsquo;s life, and
      it was the only one that had ever occurred to ruffle the smooth current of
      his quiet existence, when happening one fine afternoon, in a fit of mental
      abstraction, to raise his eyes from the slate on which he was devising
      some tremendous problem in compound addition for an offending urchin to
      solve, they suddenly rested on the blooming countenance of Maria Lobbs,
      the only daughter of old Lobbs, the great saddler over the way. Now, the
      eyes of Mr. Pipkin had rested on the pretty face of Maria Lobbs many a
      time and oft before, at church and elsewhere; but the eyes of Maria Lobbs
      had never looked so bright, the cheeks of Maria Lobbs had never looked so
      ruddy, as upon this particular occasion. No wonder then, that Nathaniel
      Pipkin was unable to take his eyes from the countenance of Miss Lobbs; no
      wonder that Miss Lobbs, finding herself stared at by a young man, withdrew
      her head from the window out of which she had been peeping, and shut the
      casement and pulled down the blind; no wonder that Nathaniel Pipkin,
      immediately thereafter, fell upon the young urchin who had previously
      offended, and cuffed and knocked him about to his heart&rsquo;s content. All
      this was very natural, and there&rsquo;s nothing at all to wonder at about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It <i>is</i> matter of wonder, though, that anyone of Mr. Nathaniel
      Pipkin&rsquo;s retiring disposition, nervous temperament, and most particularly
      diminutive income, should from this day forth, have dared to aspire to the
      hand and heart of the only daughter of the fiery old Lobbs&mdash;of old
      Lobbs, the great saddler, who could have bought up the whole village at
      one stroke of his pen, and never felt the outlay&mdash;old Lobbs, who was
      well known to have heaps of money, invested in the bank at the nearest
      market town&mdash;who was reported to have countless and inexhaustible
      treasures hoarded up in the little iron safe with the big keyhole, over
      the chimney-piece in the back parlour&mdash;and who, it was well known, on
      festive occasions garnished his board with a real silver teapot,
      cream-ewer, and sugar-basin, which he was wont, in the pride of his heart,
      to boast should be his daughter&rsquo;s property when she found a man to her
      mind. I repeat it, to be matter of profound astonishment and intense
      wonder, that Nathaniel Pipkin should have had the temerity to cast his
      eyes in this direction. But love is blind; and Nathaniel had a cast in his
      eye; and perhaps these two circumstances, taken together, prevented his
      seeing the matter in its proper light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, if old Lobbs had entertained the most remote or distant idea of the
      state of the affections of Nathaniel Pipkin, he would just have razed the
      school-room to the ground, or exterminated its master from the surface of
      the earth, or committed some other outrage and atrocity of an equally
      ferocious and violent description; for he was a terrible old fellow, was
      Lobbs, when his pride was injured, or his blood was up. Swear! Such trains
      of oaths would come rolling and pealing over the way, sometimes, when he
      was denouncing the idleness of the bony apprentice with the thin legs,
      that Nathaniel Pipkin would shake in his shoes with horror, and the hair
      of the pupils&rsquo; heads would stand on end with fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! Day after day, when school was over, and the pupils gone, did
      Nathaniel Pipkin sit himself down at the front window, and, while he
      feigned to be reading a book, throw sidelong glances over the way in
      search of the bright eyes of Maria Lobbs; and he hadn&rsquo;t sat there many
      days, before the bright eyes appeared at an upper window, apparently
      deeply engaged in reading too. This was delightful, and gladdening to the
      heart of Nathaniel Pipkin. It was something to sit there for hours
      together, and look upon that pretty face when the eyes were cast down; but
      when Maria Lobbs began to raise her eyes from her book, and dart their
      rays in the direction of Nathaniel Pipkin, his delight and admiration were
      perfectly boundless. At last, one day when he knew old Lobbs was out,
      Nathaniel Pipkin had the temerity to kiss his hand to Maria Lobbs; and
      Maria Lobbs, instead of shutting the window, and pulling down the blind,
      kissed <i>hers </i>to him, and smiled. Upon which Nathaniel Pipkin
      determined, that, come what might, he would develop the state of his
      feelings, without further delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A prettier foot, a gayer heart, a more dimpled face, or a smarter form,
      never bounded so lightly over the earth they graced, as did those of Maria
      Lobbs, the old saddler&rsquo;s daughter. There was a roguish twinkle in her
      sparkling eyes, that would have made its way to far less susceptible
      bosoms than that of Nathaniel Pipkin; and there was such a joyous sound in
      her merry laugh, that the sternest misanthrope must have smiled to hear
      it. Even old Lobbs himself, in the very height of his ferocity, couldn&rsquo;t
      resist the coaxing of his pretty daughter; and when she, and her cousin
      Kate&mdash;an arch, impudent-looking, bewitching little person&mdash;made
      a dead set upon the old man together, as, to say the truth, they very
      often did, he could have refused them nothing, even had they asked for a
      portion of the countless and inexhaustible treasures, which were hidden
      from the light, in the iron safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nathaniel Pipkin&rsquo;s heart beat high within him, when he saw this enticing
      little couple some hundred yards before him one summer&rsquo;s evening, in the
      very field in which he had many a time strolled about till night-time, and
      pondered on the beauty of Maria Lobbs. But though he had often thought
      then, how briskly he would walk up to Maria Lobbs and tell her of his
      passion if he could only meet her, he felt, now that she was unexpectedly
      before him, all the blood in his body mounting to his face, manifestly to
      the great detriment of his legs, which, deprived of their usual portion,
      trembled beneath him. When they stopped to gather a hedge flower, or
      listen to a bird, Nathaniel Pipkin stopped too, and pretended to be
      absorbed in meditation, as indeed he really was; for he was thinking what
      on earth he should ever do, when they turned back, as they inevitably must
      in time, and meet him face to face. But though he was afraid to make up to
      them, he couldn&rsquo;t bear to lose sight of them; so when they walked faster
      he walked faster, when they lingered he lingered, and when they stopped he
      stopped; and so they might have gone on, until the darkness prevented
      them, if Kate had not looked slyly back, and encouragingly beckoned
      Nathaniel to advance. There was something in Kate&rsquo;s manner that was not to
      be resisted, and so Nathaniel Pipkin complied with the invitation; and
      after a great deal of blushing on his part, and immoderate laughter on
      that of the wicked little cousin, Nathaniel Pipkin went down on his knees
      on the dewy grass, and declared his resolution to remain there for ever,
      unless he were permitted to rise the accepted lover of Maria Lobbs. Upon
      this, the merry laughter of Miss Lobbs rang through the calm evening air&mdash;without
      seeming to disturb it, though; it had such a pleasant sound&mdash;and the
      wicked little cousin laughed more immoderately than before, and Nathaniel
      Pipkin blushed deeper than ever. At length, Maria Lobbs being more
      strenuously urged by the love-worn little man, turned away her head, and
      whispered her cousin to say, or at all events Kate did say, that she felt
      much honoured by Mr. Pipkin&rsquo;s addresses; that her hand and heart were at
      her father&rsquo;s disposal; but that nobody could be insensible to Mr. Pipkin&rsquo;s
      merits. As all this was said with much gravity, and as Nathaniel Pipkin
      walked home with Maria Lobbs, and struggled for a kiss at parting, he went
      to bed a happy man, and dreamed all night long, of softening old Lobbs,
      opening the strong box, and marrying Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, Nathaniel Pipkin saw old Lobbs go out upon his old gray
      pony, and after a great many signs at the window from the wicked little
      cousin, the object and meaning of which he could by no means understand,
      the bony apprentice with the thin legs came over to say that his master
      wasn&rsquo;t coming home all night, and that the ladies expected Mr. Pipkin to
      tea, at six o&rsquo;clock precisely. How the lessons were got through that day,
      neither Nathaniel Pipkin nor his pupils knew any more than you do; but
      they were got through somehow, and, after the boys had gone, Nathaniel
      Pipkin took till full six o&rsquo;clock to dress himself to his satisfaction.
      Not that it took long to select the garments he should wear, inasmuch as
      he had no choice about the matter; but the putting of them on to the best
      advantage, and the touching of them up previously, was a task of no
      inconsiderable difficulty or importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was a very snug little party, consisting of Maria Lobbs and her
      cousin Kate, and three or four romping, good-humoured, rosy-cheeked girls.
      Nathaniel Pipkin had ocular demonstration of the fact, that the rumours of
      old Lobbs&rsquo;s treasures were not exaggerated. There were the real solid
      silver teapot, cream-ewer, and sugar-basin, on the table, and real silver
      spoons to stir the tea with, and real china cups to drink it out of, and
      plates of the same, to hold the cakes and toast in. The only eye-sore in
      the whole place was another cousin of Maria Lobbs&rsquo;s, and a brother of
      Kate, whom Maria Lobbs called &ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; and who seemed to keep Maria Lobbs
      all to himself, up in one corner of the table. It&rsquo;s a delightful thing to
      see affection in families, but it may be carried rather too far, and
      Nathaniel Pipkin could not help thinking that Maria Lobbs must be very
      particularly fond of her relations, if she paid as much attention to all
      of them as to this individual cousin. After tea, too, when the wicked
      little cousin proposed a game at blind man&rsquo;s buff, it somehow or other
      happened that Nathaniel Pipkin was nearly always blind, and whenever he
      laid his hand upon the male cousin, he was sure to find that Maria Lobbs
      was not far off. And though the wicked little cousin and the other girls
      pinched him, and pulled his hair, and pushed chairs in his way, and all
      sorts of things, Maria Lobbs never seemed to come near him at all; and
      once&mdash;once&mdash;Nathaniel Pipkin could have sworn he heard the sound
      of a kiss, followed by a faint remonstrance from Maria Lobbs, and a
      half-suppressed laugh from her female friends. All this was odd&mdash;very
      odd&mdash;and there is no saying what Nathaniel Pipkin might or might not
      have done, in consequence, if his thoughts had not been suddenly directed
      into a new channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The circumstance which directed his thoughts into a new channel was a
      loud knocking at the street door, and the person who made this loud
      knocking at the street door was no other than old Lobbs himself, who had
      unexpectedly returned, and was hammering away, like a coffin-maker; for he
      wanted his supper. The alarming intelligence was no sooner communicated by
      the bony apprentice with the thin legs, than the girls tripped upstairs to
      Maria Lobbs&rsquo;s bedroom, and the male cousin and Nathaniel Pipkin were
      thrust into a couple of closets in the sitting-room, for want of any
      better places of concealment; and when Maria Lobbs and the wicked little
      cousin had stowed them away, and put the room to rights, they opened the
      street door to old Lobbs, who had never left off knocking since he first
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now it did unfortunately happen that old Lobbs being very hungry was
      monstrous cross. Nathaniel Pipkin could hear him growling away like an old
      mastiff with a sore throat; and whenever the unfortunate apprentice with
      the thin legs came into the room, so surely did old Lobbs commence
      swearing at him in a most Saracenic and ferocious manner, though
      apparently with no other end or object than that of easing his bosom by
      the discharge of a few superfluous oaths. At length some supper, which had
      been warming up, was placed on the table, and then old Lobbs fell to, in
      regular style; and having made clear work of it in no time, kissed his
      daughter, and demanded his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nature had placed Nathaniel Pipkin&rsquo;s knees in very close juxtaposition,
      but when he heard old Lobbs demand his pipe, they knocked together, as if
      they were going to reduce each other to powder; for, depending from a
      couple of hooks, in the very closet in which he stood, was a large,
      brown-stemmed, silver-bowled pipe, which pipe he himself had seen in the
      mouth of old Lobbs, regularly every afternoon and evening, for the last
      five years. The two girls went downstairs for the pipe, and upstairs for
      the pipe, and everywhere but where they knew the pipe was, and old Lobbs
      stormed away meanwhile, in the most wonderful manner. At last he thought
      of the closet, and walked up to it. It was of no use a little man like
      Nathaniel Pipkin pulling the door inwards, when a great strong fellow like
      old Lobbs was pulling it outwards. Old Lobbs gave it one tug, and open it
      flew, disclosing Nathaniel Pipkin standing bolt upright inside, and
      shaking with apprehension from head to foot. Bless us! what an appalling
      look old Lobbs gave him, as he dragged him out by the collar, and held him
      at arm&rsquo;s length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Why, what the devil do you want here?&rdquo; said old Lobbs, in a fearful
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nathaniel Pipkin could make no reply, so old Lobbs shook him backwards
      and forwards, for two or three minutes, by way of arranging his ideas for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo; roared Lobbs; &ldquo;I suppose you have come after my
      daughter, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old Lobbs merely said this as a sneer: for he did not believe that mortal
      presumption could have carried Nathaniel Pipkin so far. What was his
      indignation, when that poor man replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, I did, Mr. Lobbs, I did come after your daughter. I love her, Mr.
      Lobbs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Why, you snivelling, wry-faced, puny villain,&rdquo; gasped old Lobbs,
      paralysed by the atrocious confession; &ldquo;what do you mean by that? Say this
      to my face! Damme, I&rsquo;ll throttle you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is by no means improbable that old Lobbs would have carried his threat
      into execution, in the excess of his rage, if his arm had not been stayed
      by a very unexpected apparition: to wit, the male cousin, who, stepping
      out of his closet, and walking up to old Lobbs, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I cannot allow this harmless person, Sir, who has been asked here, in
      some girlish frolic, to take upon himself, in a very noble manner, the
      fault (if fault it is) which I am guilty of, and am ready to avow. I love
      your daughter, sir; and I came here for the purpose of meeting her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old Lobbs opened his eyes very wide at this, but not wider than Nathaniel
      Pipkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; said Lobbs, at last finding breath to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;And I forbade you this house, long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You did, or I should not have been here, clandestinely, to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry to record it of old Lobbs, but I think he would have struck
      the cousin, if his pretty daughter, with her bright eyes swimming in
      tears, had not clung to his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop him, Maria,&rdquo; said the young man; &ldquo;if he has the will to
      strike me, let him. I would not hurt a hair of his gray head, for the
      riches of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old man cast down his eyes at this reproof, and they met those of his
      daughter. I have hinted once or twice before, that they were very bright
      eyes, and, though they were tearful now, their influence was by no means
      lessened. Old Lobbs turned his head away, as if to avoid being persuaded
      by them, when, as fortune would have it, he encountered the face of the
      wicked little cousin, who, half afraid for her brother, and half laughing
      at Nathaniel Pipkin, presented as bewitching an expression of countenance,
      with a touch of slyness in it, too, as any man, old or young, need look
      upon. She drew her arm coaxingly through the old man&rsquo;s, and whispered
      something in his ear; and do what he would, old Lobbs couldn&rsquo;t help
      breaking out into a smile, while a tear stole down his cheek at the same
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Five minutes after this, the girls were brought down from the bedroom
      with a great deal of giggling and modesty; and while the young people were
      making themselves perfectly happy, old Lobbs got down the pipe, and smoked
      it; and it was a remarkable circumstance about that particular pipe of
      tobacco, that it was the most soothing and delightful one he ever smoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nathaniel Pipkin thought it best to keep his own counsel, and by so doing
      gradually rose into high favour with old Lobbs, who taught him to smoke in
      time; and they used to sit out in the garden on the fine evenings, for
      many years afterwards, smoking and drinking in great state. He soon
      recovered the effects of his attachment, for we find his name in the
      parish register, as a witness to the marriage of Maria Lobbs to her
      cousin; and it also appears, by reference to other documents, that on the
      night of the wedding he was incarcerated in the village cage, for having,
      in a state of extreme intoxication, committed sundry excesses in the
      streets, in all of which he was aided and abetted by the bony apprentice
      with the thin legs.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. BRIEFLY ILLUSTRATIVE OF TWO POINTS; FIRST, THE POWER OF
      HYSTERICS, AND, SECONDLY, THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>or two days after
      the <i>dejeune </i>at Mrs. Hunter&rsquo;s, the Pickwickians remained at
      Eatanswill, anxiously awaiting the arrival of some intelligence from their
      revered leader. Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass were once again left to their
      own means of amusement; for Mr. Winkle, in compliance with a most pressing
      invitation, continued to reside at Mr. Pott&rsquo;s house, and to devote his
      time to the companionship of his amiable lady. Nor was the occasional
      society of Mr. Pott himself wanting to complete their felicity. Deeply
      immersed in the intensity of his speculations for the public weal and the
      destruction of the <i>Independent</i>, it was not the habit of that great
      man to descend from his mental pinnacle to the humble level of ordinary
      minds. On this occasion, however, and as if expressly in compliment to any
      follower of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s, he unbent, relaxed, stepped down from his
      pedestal, and walked upon the ground, benignly adapting his remarks to the
      comprehension of the herd, and seeming in outward form, if not in spirit,
      to be one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such having been the demeanour of this celebrated public character towards
      Mr. Winkle, it will be readily imagined that considerable surprise was
      depicted on the countenance of the latter gentleman, when, as he was
      sitting alone in the breakfast-room, the door was hastily thrown open, and
      as hastily closed, on the entrance of Mr. Pott, who, stalking majestically
      towards him, and thrusting aside his proffered hand, ground his teeth, as
      if to put a sharper edge on what he was about to utter, and exclaimed, in
      a saw-like voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serpent!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Winkle, starting from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serpent, Sir,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Pott, raising his voice, and then suddenly
      depressing it: &lsquo;I said, serpent, sir&mdash;make the most of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When you have parted with a man at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, on terms of
      the utmost good-fellowship, and he meets you again, at half-past nine, and
      greets you as a serpent, it is not unreasonable to conclude that something
      of an unpleasant nature has occurred meanwhile. So Mr. Winkle thought. He
      returned Mr. Pott&rsquo;s gaze of stone, and in compliance with that gentleman&rsquo;s
      request, proceeded to make the most he could of the &lsquo;serpent.&rsquo; The most,
      however, was nothing at all; so, after a profound silence of some minutes&rsquo; 
      duration, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serpent, Sir! Serpent, Mr. Pott! What can you mean, Sir?&mdash;this is
      pleasantry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pleasantry, sir!&rsquo; exclaimed Pott, with a motion of the hand, indicative
      of a strong desire to hurl the Britannia metal teapot at the head of the
      visitor. &lsquo;Pleasantry, sir!&mdash;But&mdash;no, I will be calm; I will be
      calm, Sir;&rsquo; in proof of his calmness, Mr. Pott flung himself into a chair,
      and foamed at the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear sir,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>DEAR </i>Sir!&rsquo; replied Pott. &lsquo;How dare you address me, as dear Sir,
      Sir? How dare you look me in the face and do it, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Sir, if you come to that,&rsquo; responded Mr. Winkle, &lsquo;how dare you look
      me in the face, and call me a serpent, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because you are one,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Prove it, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle warmly. &lsquo;Prove it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A malignant scowl passed over the profound face of the editor, as he drew
      from his pocket the <i>Independent</i> of that morning; and laying his
      finger on a particular paragraph, threw the journal across the table to
      Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      That gentleman took it up, and read as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our obscure and filthy contemporary, in some disgusting observations on
      the recent election for this borough, has presumed to violate the hallowed
      sanctity of private life, and to refer in a manner not to be
      misunderstood, to the personal affairs of our late candidate&mdash;aye,
      and notwithstanding his base defeat, we will add, our future member, Mr.
      Fizkin. What does our dastardly contemporary mean? What would the ruffian
      say, if we, setting at naught, like him, the decencies of social
      intercourse, were to raise the curtain which happily conceals <i>His</i>
      private life from general ridicule, not to say from general execration?
      What, if we were even to point out, and comment on, facts and
      circumstances, which are publicly notorious, and beheld by every one but
      our mole-eyed contemporary&mdash;what if we were to print the following
      effusion, which we received while we were writing the commencement of this
      article, from a talented fellow-townsman and correspondent?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;&ldquo;LINES TO A BRASS POT

   &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh Pott! if you&rsquo;d known
   How false she&rsquo;d have grown,
   When you heard the marriage bells tinkle;
   You&rsquo;d have done then, I vow,
   What you cannot help now,
</pre>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &lsquo;What,&rsquo; said Mr. Pott solemnly&mdash;&lsquo;what rhymes to &ldquo;tinkle,&rdquo; villain?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What rhymes to tinkle?&rsquo; said Mrs. Pott, whose entrance at the moment
      forestalled the reply. &lsquo;What rhymes to tinkle? Why, Winkle, I should
      conceive.&rsquo; Saying this, Mrs. Pott smiled sweetly on the disturbed
      Pickwickian, and extended her hand towards him. The agitated young man
      would have accepted it, in his confusion, had not Pott indignantly
      interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Back, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;back!&rsquo; said the editor. &lsquo;Take his hand before my very
      face!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. P.!&rsquo; said his astonished lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wretched woman, look here,&rsquo; exclaimed the husband. &lsquo;Look here, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;&ldquo;Lines
      to a Brass Pot.&rdquo; &ldquo;Brass Pot&rdquo;; that&rsquo;s me, ma&rsquo;am. &ldquo;False <i>she&rsquo;d</i> have
      grown&rdquo;; that&rsquo;s you, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;you.&rsquo; With this ebullition of rage, which
      was not unaccompanied with something like a tremble, at the expression of
      his wife&rsquo;s face, Mr. Pott dashed the current number of the Eatanswill <i>Independent</i>
      at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word, Sir,&rsquo; said the astonished Mrs. Pott, stooping to pick up
      the paper. &lsquo;Upon my word, Sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pott winced beneath the contemptuous gaze of his wife. He had made a
      desperate struggle to screw up his courage, but it was fast coming
      unscrewed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      There appears nothing very tremendous in this little sentence, &lsquo;Upon my
      word, sir,&rsquo; when it comes to be read; but the tone of voice in which it
      was delivered, and the look that accompanied it, both seeming to bear
      reference to some revenge to be thereafter visited upon the head of Pott,
      produced their effect upon him. The most unskilful observer could have
      detected in his troubled countenance, a readiness to resign his Wellington
      boots to any efficient substitute who would have consented to stand in
      them at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pott read the paragraph, uttered a loud shriek, and threw herself at
      full length on the hearth-rug, screaming, and tapping it with the heels of
      her shoes, in a manner which could leave no doubt of the propriety of her
      feelings on the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said the terrified Pott, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I believed it;&mdash;I&mdash;&rsquo; 
      but the unfortunate man&rsquo;s voice was drowned in the screaming of his
      partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Pott, let me entreat you, my dear ma&rsquo;am, to compose yourself,&rsquo; said
      Mr. Winkle; but the shrieks and tappings were louder, and more frequent
      than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Pott, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry. If you won&rsquo;t consider your own
      health, consider me, my dear. We shall have a crowd round the house.&rsquo; But
      the more strenuously Mr. Pott entreated, the more vehemently the screams
      poured forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very fortunately, however, attached to Mrs. Pott&rsquo;s person was a bodyguard
      of one, a young lady whose ostensible employment was to preside over her
      toilet, but who rendered herself useful in a variety of ways, and in none
      more so than in the particular department of constantly aiding and
      abetting her mistress in every wish and inclination opposed to the desires
      of the unhappy Pott. The screams reached this young lady&rsquo;s ears in due
      course, and brought her into the room with a speed which threatened to
      derange, materially, the very exquisite arrangement of her cap and
      ringlets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, my dear, dear mistress!&rsquo; exclaimed the bodyguard, kneeling
      frantically by the side of the prostrate Mrs. Pott. &lsquo;Oh, my dear mistress,
      what is the matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your master&mdash;your brutal master,&rsquo; murmured the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pott was evidently giving way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a shame,&rsquo; said the bodyguard reproachfully. &lsquo;I know he&rsquo;ll be the
      death on you, ma&rsquo;am. Poor dear thing!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave way more. The opposite party followed up the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t leave me&mdash;don&rsquo;t leave me, Goodwin,&rsquo; murmured Mrs. Pott,
      clutching at the wrist of the said Goodwin with an hysteric jerk. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
      the only person that&rsquo;s kind to me, Goodwin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this affecting appeal, Goodwin got up a little domestic tragedy of her
      own, and shed tears copiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;never,&rsquo; said Goodwin. &lsquo;Oh, sir, you should be careful&mdash;you
      should indeed; you don&rsquo;t know what harm you may do missis; you&rsquo;ll be sorry
      for it one day, I know&mdash;I&rsquo;ve always said so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The unlucky Pott looked timidly on, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goodwin,&rsquo; said Mrs. Pott, in a soft voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Goodwin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you only knew how I have loved that man&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Don&rsquo;t distress yourself by recollecting it, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the bodyguard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pott looked very frightened. It was time to finish him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now,&rsquo; sobbed Mrs. Pott, &lsquo;now, after all, to be treated in this way;
      to be reproached and insulted in the presence of a third party, and that
      party almost a stranger. But I will not submit to it! Goodwin,&rsquo; continued
      Mrs. Pott, raising herself in the arms of her attendant, &lsquo;my brother, the
      lieutenant, shall interfere. I&rsquo;ll be separated, Goodwin!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would certainly serve him right, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Goodwin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever thoughts the threat of a separation might have awakened in Mr.
      Pott&rsquo;s mind, he forbore to give utterance to them, and contented himself
      by saying, with great humility:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, will you hear me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A fresh train of sobs was the only reply, as Mrs. Pott grew more
      hysterical, requested to be informed why she was ever born, and required
      sundry other pieces of information of a similar description.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; remonstrated Mr. Pott, &lsquo;do not give way to these sensitive
      feelings. I never believed that the paragraph had any foundation, my dear&mdash;impossible.
      I was only angry, my dear&mdash;I may say outrageous&mdash;with the <i>Independent</i>
      people for daring to insert it; that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; Mr. Pott cast an imploring
      look at the innocent cause of the mischief, as if to entreat him to say
      nothing about the serpent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what steps, sir, do you mean to take to obtain redress?&rsquo; inquired Mr.
      Winkle, gaining courage as he saw Pott losing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Goodwin,&rsquo; observed Mrs. Pott, &lsquo;does he mean to horsewhip the editor
      of the <i>Independent</i>&mdash;does he, Goodwin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, hush, ma&rsquo;am; pray keep yourself quiet,&rsquo; replied the bodyguard. &lsquo;I
      dare say he will, if you wish it, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said Pott, as his wife evinced decided symptoms of going off
      again. &lsquo;Of course I shall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When, Goodwin&mdash;when?&rsquo; said Mrs. Pott, still undecided about the
      going off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Immediately, of course,&rsquo; said Mr. Pott; &lsquo;before the day is out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Goodwin,&rsquo; resumed Mrs. Pott, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the only way of meeting the
      slander, and setting me right with the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied Goodwin. &lsquo;No man as is a man, ma&rsquo;am, could
      refuse to do it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So, as the hysterics were still hovering about, Mr. Pott said once more
      that he would do it; but Mrs. Pott was so overcome at the bare idea of
      having ever been suspected, that she was half a dozen times on the very
      verge of a relapse, and most unquestionably would have gone off, had it
      not been for the indefatigable efforts of the assiduous Goodwin, and
      repeated entreaties for pardon from the conquered Pott; and finally, when
      that unhappy individual had been frightened and snubbed down to his proper
      level, Mrs. Pott recovered, and they went to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will not allow this base newspaper slander to shorten your stay here,
      Mr. Winkle?&rsquo; said Mrs. Pott, smiling through the traces of her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope not,&rsquo; said Mr. Pott, actuated, as he spoke, by a wish that his
      visitor would choke himself with the morsel of dry toast which he was
      raising to his lips at the moment, and so terminate his stay effectually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are very good,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle; &lsquo;but a letter has been received from
      Mr. Pickwick&mdash;so I learn by a note from Mr. Tupman, which was brought
      up to my bedroom door, this morning&mdash;in which he requests us to join
      him at Bury to-day; and we are to leave by the coach at noon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you will come back?&rsquo; said Mrs. Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, certainly,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are quite sure?&rsquo; said Mrs. Pott, stealing a tender look at her
      visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite,&rsquo; responded Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast passed off in silence, for each of the party was brooding
      over his, or her, own personal grievances. Mrs. Pott was regretting the
      loss of a beau; Mr. Pott his rash pledge to horsewhip the <i>Independent</i>;
      Mr. Winkle his having innocently placed himself in so awkward a situation.
      Noon approached, and after many adieux and promises to return, he tore
      himself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he ever comes back, I&rsquo;ll poison him,&rsquo; thought Mr. Pott, as he turned
      into the little back office where he prepared his thunderbolts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I ever do come back, and mix myself up with these people again,&rsquo; 
      thought Mr. Winkle, as he wended his way to the Peacock, &lsquo;I shall deserve
      to be horsewhipped myself&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His friends were ready, the coach was nearly so, and in half an hour they
      were proceeding on their journey, along the road over which Mr. Pickwick
      and Sam had so recently travelled, and of which, as we have already said
      something, we do not feel called upon to extract Mr. Snodgrass&rsquo;s poetical
      and beautiful description.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller was standing at the door of the Angel, ready to receive them,
      and by that gentleman they were ushered to the apartment of Mr. Pickwick,
      where, to the no small surprise of Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass, and the
      no small embarrassment of Mr. Tupman, they found old Wardle and Trundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo; said the old man, grasping Mr. Tupman&rsquo;s hand. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t hang
      back, or look sentimental about it; it can&rsquo;t be helped, old fellow. For
      her sake, I wish you&rsquo;d had her; for your own, I&rsquo;m very glad you have not.
      A young fellow like you will do better one of these days, eh?&rsquo; With this
      conclusion, Wardle slapped Mr. Tupman on the back, and laughed heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and how are you, my fine fellows?&rsquo; said the old gentleman, shaking
      hands with Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass at the same time. &lsquo;I have just
      been telling Pickwick that we must have you all down at Christmas. We&rsquo;re
      going to have a wedding&mdash;a real wedding this time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A wedding!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass, turning very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, a wedding. But don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rsquo; said the good-humoured old man;
      &lsquo;it&rsquo;s only Trundle there, and Bella.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, is that all?&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass, relieved from a painful doubt which
      had fallen heavily on his breast. &lsquo;Give you joy, Sir. How is Joe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; replied the old gentleman. &lsquo;Sleepy as ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And your mother, and the clergyman, and all of &lsquo;em?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, with an effort&mdash;&lsquo;where is&mdash;<i>she</i>,
      Sir?&rsquo; and he turned away his head, and covered his eyes with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>She</i>!&rsquo; said the old gentleman, with a knowing shake of the head.
      &lsquo;Do you mean my single relative&mdash;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman, by a nod, intimated that his question applied to the
      disappointed Rachael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s gone away,&rsquo; said the old gentleman. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s living at a
      relation&rsquo;s, far enough off. She couldn&rsquo;t bear to see the girls, so I let
      her go. But come! Here&rsquo;s the dinner. You must be hungry after your ride. I
      am, without any ride at all; so let us fall to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ample justice was done to the meal; and when they were seated round the
      table, after it had been disposed of, Mr. Pickwick, to the intense horror
      and indignation of his followers, related the adventure he had undergone,
      and the success which had attended the base artifices of the diabolical
      Jingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the attack of rheumatism which I caught in that garden,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Pickwick, in conclusion, &lsquo;renders me lame at this moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I, too, have had something of an adventure,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, with a
      smile; and, at the request of Mr. Pickwick, he detailed the malicious
      libel of the Eatanswill <i>Independent</i>, and the consequent excitement
      of their friend, the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s brow darkened during the recital. His friends observed it,
      and, when Mr. Winkle had concluded, maintained a profound silence. Mr.
      Pickwick struck the table emphatically with his clenched fist, and spoke
      as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it not a wonderful circumstance,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;that we seem
      destined to enter no man&rsquo;s house without involving him in some degree of
      trouble? Does it not, I ask, bespeak the indiscretion, or, worse than
      that, the blackness of heart&mdash;that I should say so!&mdash;of my
      followers, that, beneath whatever roof they locate, they disturb the peace
      of mind and happiness of some confiding female? Is it not, I say&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick would in all probability have gone on for some time, had not
      the entrance of Sam, with a letter, caused him to break off in his
      eloquent discourse. He passed his handkerchief across his forehead, took
      off his spectacles, wiped them, and put them on again; and his voice had
      recovered its wonted softness of tone when he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you there, Sam?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Called at the post-office just now, and found this here letter, as has
      laid there for two days,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s sealed vith a vafer,
      and directed in round hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know this hand,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, opening the letter. &lsquo;Mercy on
      us! what&rsquo;s this? It must be a jest; it&mdash;it&mdash;can&rsquo;t be true.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; was the general inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody dead, is there?&rsquo; said Wardle, alarmed at the horror in Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick made no reply, but, pushing the letter across the table, and
      desiring Mr. Tupman to read it aloud, fell back in his chair with a look
      of vacant astonishment quite alarming to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman, with a trembling voice, read the letter, of which the
      following is a copy:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Freeman&rsquo;s Court, Cornhill, August 28th, 1827.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bardell against Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      Having been instructed by Mrs. Martha Bardell to commence an action
      against you for a breach of promise of marriage, for which the plaintiff
      lays her damages at fifteen hundred pounds, we beg to inform you that a
      writ has been issued against you in this suit in the Court of Common
      Pleas; and request to know, by return of post, the name of your attorney
      in London, who will accept service thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are, Sir, Your obedient servants, Dodson &amp; Fogg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samuel Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something so impressive in the mute astonishment with which each
      man regarded his neighbour, and every man regarded Mr. Pickwick, that all
      seemed afraid to speak. The silence was at length broken by Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dodson and Fogg,&rsquo; he repeated mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bardell and Pickwick,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass, musing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peace of mind and happiness of confiding females,&rsquo; murmured Mr. Winkle,
      with an air of abstraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a conspiracy,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, at length recovering the power of
      speech; &lsquo;a base conspiracy between these two grasping attorneys, Dodson
      and Fogg. Mrs. Bardell would never do it;&mdash;she hasn&rsquo;t the heart to do
      it;&mdash;she hasn&rsquo;t the case to do it. Ridiculous&mdash;ridiculous.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Of her heart,&rsquo; said Wardle, with a smile, &lsquo;you should certainly be the
      best judge. I don&rsquo;t wish to discourage you, but I should certainly say
      that, of her case, Dodson and Fogg are far better judges than any of us
      can be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a vile attempt to extort money,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope it is,&rsquo; said Wardle, with a short, dry cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who ever heard me address her in any way but that in which a lodger would
      address his landlady?&rsquo; continued Mr. Pickwick, with great vehemence. &lsquo;Who
      ever saw me with her? Not even my friends here&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Except on one occasion,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick changed colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Mr. Wardle. &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s important. There was nothing
      suspicious then, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman glanced timidly at his leader. &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;there was
      nothing suspicious; but&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how it happened, mind&mdash;she
      certainly was reclining in his arms.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gracious powers!&rsquo; ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, as the recollection of the
      scene in question struck forcibly upon him; &lsquo;what a dreadful instance of
      the force of circumstances! So she was&mdash;so she was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And our friend was soothing her anguish,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, rather
      maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I was,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t deny it. So I was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo!&rsquo; said Wardle; &lsquo;for a case in which there&rsquo;s nothing suspicious,
      this looks rather queer&mdash;eh, Pickwick? Ah, sly dog&mdash;sly dog!&rsquo; 
      and he laughed till the glasses on the sideboard rang again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a dreadful conjunction of appearances!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick,
      resting his chin upon his hands. &lsquo;Winkle&mdash;Tupman&mdash;I beg your
      pardon for the observations I made just now. We are all the victims of
      circumstances, and I the greatest.&rsquo; With this apology Mr. Pickwick buried
      his head in his hands, and ruminated; while Wardle measured out a regular
      circle of nods and winks, addressed to the other members of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have it explained, though,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, raising his head and
      hammering the table. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see this Dodson and Fogg! I&rsquo;ll go to London
      to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not to-morrow,&rsquo; said Wardle; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re too lame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, next day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Next day is the first of September, and you&rsquo;re pledged to ride out with
      us, as far as Sir Geoffrey Manning&rsquo;s grounds at all events, and to meet us
      at lunch, if you don&rsquo;t take the field.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, the day after,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;Thursday.&mdash;Sam!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take two places outside to London, on Thursday morning, for yourself and
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery well, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller left the room, and departed slowly on his errand, with his
      hands in his pocket and his eyes fixed on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rum feller, the hemperor,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, as he walked slowly up the
      street. &lsquo;Think o&rsquo; his makin&rsquo; up to that &lsquo;ere Mrs. Bardell&mdash;vith a
      little boy, too! Always the vay vith these here old &lsquo;uns howsoever, as is
      such steady goers to look at. I didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; done it, though&mdash;I
      didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; done it!&rsquo; Moralising in this strain, Mr. Samuel
      Weller bent his steps towards the booking-office.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. A PLEASANT DAY WITH AN UNPLEASANT TERMINATION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he birds, who,
      happily for their own peace of mind and personal comfort, were in blissful
      ignorance of the preparations which had been making to astonish them, on
      the first of September, hailed it, no doubt, as one of the pleasantest
      mornings they had seen that season. Many a young partridge who strutted
      complacently among the stubble, with all the finicking coxcombry of youth,
      and many an older one who watched his levity out of his little round eye,
      with the contemptuous air of a bird of wisdom and experience, alike
      unconscious of their approaching doom, basked in the fresh morning air
      with lively and blithesome feelings, and a few hours afterwards were laid
      low upon the earth. But we grow affecting: let us proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In plain commonplace matter-of-fact, then, it was a fine morning&mdash;so
      fine that you would scarcely have believed that the few months of an
      English summer had yet flown by. Hedges, fields, and trees, hill and
      moorland, presented to the eye their ever-varying shades of deep rich
      green; scarce a leaf had fallen, scarce a sprinkle of yellow mingled with
      the hues of summer, warned you that autumn had begun. The sky was
      cloudless; the sun shone out bright and warm; the songs of birds, the hum
      of myriads of summer insects, filled the air; and the cottage gardens,
      crowded with flowers of every rich and beautiful tint, sparkled, in the
      heavy dew, like beds of glittering jewels. Everything bore the stamp of
      summer, and none of its beautiful colour had yet faded from the die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the morning, when an open carriage, in which were three
      Pickwickians (Mr. Snodgrass having preferred to remain at home), Mr.
      Wardle, and Mr. Trundle, with Sam Weller on the box beside the driver,
      pulled up by a gate at the roadside, before which stood a tall, raw-boned
      gamekeeper, and a half-booted, leather-legginged boy, each bearing a bag
      of capacious dimensions, and accompanied by a brace of pointers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; whispered Mr. Winkle to Wardle, as the man let down the steps,
      &lsquo;they don&rsquo;t suppose we&rsquo;re going to kill game enough to fill those bags, do
      they?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fill them!&rsquo; exclaimed old Wardle. &lsquo;Bless you, yes! You shall fill one,
      and I the other; and when we&rsquo;ve done with them, the pockets of our
      shooting-jackets will hold as much more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle dismounted without saying anything in reply to this
      observation; but he thought within himself, that if the party remained in
      the open air, till he had filled one of the bags, they stood a
      considerable chance of catching colds in their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hi, Juno, lass-hi, old girl; down, Daph, down,&rsquo; said Wardle, caressing
      the dogs. &lsquo;Sir Geoffrey still in Scotland, of course, Martin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall gamekeeper replied in the affirmative, and looked with some
      surprise from Mr. Winkle, who was holding his gun as if he wished his coat
      pocket to save him the trouble of pulling the trigger, to Mr. Tupman, who
      was holding his as if he was afraid of it&mdash;as there is no earthly
      reason to doubt he really was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friends are not much in the way of this sort of thing yet, Martin,&rsquo; 
      said Wardle, noticing the look. &lsquo;Live and learn, you know. They&rsquo;ll be good
      shots one of these days. I beg my friend Winkle&rsquo;s pardon, though; he has
      had some practice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle smiled feebly over his blue neckerchief in acknowledgment of
      the compliment, and got himself so mysteriously entangled with his gun, in
      his modest confusion, that if the piece had been loaded, he must
      inevitably have shot himself dead upon the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t handle your piece in that &lsquo;ere way, when you come to have the
      charge in it, Sir,&rsquo; said the tall gamekeeper gruffly; &lsquo;or I&rsquo;m damned if
      you won&rsquo;t make cold meat of some on us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle, thus admonished, abruptly altered his position, and in so
      doing, contrived to bring the barrel into pretty smart contact with Mr.
      Weller&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo!&rsquo; said Sam, picking up his hat, which had been knocked off, and
      rubbing his temple. &lsquo;Hollo, sir! if you comes it this vay, you&rsquo;ll fill one
      o&rsquo; them bags, and something to spare, at one fire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the leather-legginged boy laughed very heartily, and then tried to
      look as if it was somebody else, whereat Mr. Winkle frowned majestically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where did you tell the boy to meet us with the snack, Martin?&rsquo; inquired
      Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Side of One-tree Hill, at twelve o&rsquo;clock, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not Sir Geoffrey&rsquo;s land, is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Sir; but it&rsquo;s close by it. It&rsquo;s Captain Boldwig&rsquo;s land; but there&rsquo;ll
      be nobody to interrupt us, and there&rsquo;s a fine bit of turf there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said old Wardle. &lsquo;Now the sooner we&rsquo;re off the better. Will
      you join us at twelve, then, Pickwick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was particularly desirous to view the sport, the more
      especially as he was rather anxious in respect of Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s life and
      limbs. On so inviting a morning, too, it was very tantalising to turn
      back, and leave his friends to enjoy themselves. It was, therefore, with a
      very rueful air that he replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I suppose I must.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t the gentleman a shot, Sir?&rsquo; inquired the long gamekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Wardle; &lsquo;and he&rsquo;s lame besides.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should very much like to go,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick&mdash;&lsquo;very much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short pause of commiseration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a barrow t&rsquo;other side the hedge,&rsquo; said the boy. &lsquo;If the
      gentleman&rsquo;s servant would wheel along the paths, he could keep nigh us,
      and we could lift it over the stiles, and that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wery thing,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, who was a party interested, inasmuch as
      he ardently longed to see the sport. &lsquo;The wery thing. Well said,
      Smallcheek; I&rsquo;ll have it out in a minute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But here a difficulty arose. The long gamekeeper resolutely protested
      against the introduction into a shooting party, of a gentleman in a
      barrow, as a gross violation of all established rules and precedents.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great objection, but not an insurmountable one. The gamekeeper
      having been coaxed and feed, and having, moreover, eased his mind by
      &lsquo;punching&rsquo; the head of the inventive youth who had first suggested the use
      of the machine, Mr. Pickwick was placed in it, and off the party set;
      Wardle and the long gamekeeper leading the way, and Mr. Pickwick in the
      barrow, propelled by Sam, bringing up the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, when they had got half across the first
      field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rsquo; said Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t suffer this barrow to be moved another step,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
      resolutely, &lsquo;unless Winkle carries that gun of his in a different manner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How <i>am</i> I to carry it?&rsquo; said the wretched Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Carry it with the muzzle to the ground,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s so unsportsmanlike,&rsquo; reasoned Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether it&rsquo;s unsportsmanlike or not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick;
      &lsquo;I am not going to be shot in a wheel-barrow, for the sake of appearances,
      to please anybody.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know the gentleman&rsquo;ll put that &lsquo;ere charge into somebody afore he&rsquo;s
      done,&rsquo; growled the long man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rsquo; said poor Winkle, turning his gun-stock
      uppermost&mdash;&lsquo;there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anythin&rsquo; for a quiet life,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller; and on they went again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, after they had gone a few yards farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What now?&rsquo; said Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That gun of Tupman&rsquo;s is not safe: I know it isn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh? What! not safe?&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, in a tone of great alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not as you are carrying it,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;I am very sorry to make
      any further objection, but I cannot consent to go on, unless you carry it
      as Winkle does his.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you had better, sir,&rsquo; said the long gamekeeper, &lsquo;or you&rsquo;re quite
      as likely to lodge the charge in yourself as in anything else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman, with the most obliging haste, placed his piece in the position
      required, and the party moved on again; the two amateurs marching with
      reversed arms, like a couple of privates at a royal funeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dogs suddenly came to a dead stop, and the party advancing stealthily
      a single pace, stopped too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the dogs&rsquo; legs?&rsquo; whispered Mr. Winkle. &lsquo;How queer
      they&rsquo;re standing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; replied Wardle softly. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, they&rsquo;re making a
      point?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Making a point!&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, staring about him, as if he expected to
      discover some particular beauty in the landscape, which the sagacious
      animals were calling special attention to. &lsquo;Making a point! What are they
      pointing at?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep your eyes open,&rsquo; said Wardle, not heeding the question in the
      excitement of the moment. &lsquo;Now then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sharp whirring noise, that made Mr. Winkle start back as if he
      had been shot himself. Bang, bang, went a couple of guns&mdash;the smoke
      swept quickly away over the field, and curled into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are they!&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, in a state of the highest excitement,
      turning round and round in all directions. &lsquo;Where are they? Tell me when
      to fire. Where are they&mdash;where are they?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are they!&rsquo; said Wardle, taking up a brace of birds which the dogs
      had deposited at his feet. &lsquo;Why, here they are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; I mean the others,&rsquo; said the bewildered Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Far enough off, by this time,&rsquo; replied Wardle, coolly reloading his gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall very likely be up with another covey in five minutes,&rsquo; said the
      long gamekeeper. &lsquo;If the gentleman begins to fire now, perhaps he&rsquo;ll just
      get the shot out of the barrel by the time they rise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; roared Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, compassionating his follower&rsquo;s confusion and
      embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not, Sir.&rsquo; So, by way of indemnification, Mr. Weller contorted
      his features from behind the wheel-barrow, for the exclusive amusement of
      the boy with the leggings, who thereupon burst into a boisterous laugh,
      and was summarily cuffed by the long gamekeeper, who wanted a pretext for
      turning round, to hide his own merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bravo, old fellow!&rsquo; said Wardle to Mr. Tupman; &lsquo;you fired that time, at
      all events.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; replied Mr. Tupman, with conscious pride. &lsquo;I let it off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well done. You&rsquo;ll hit something next time, if you look sharp. Very easy,
      ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s very easy,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman. &lsquo;How it hurts one&rsquo;s shoulder,
      though. It nearly knocked me backwards. I had no idea these small firearms
      kicked so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, smiling, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll get used to it in time. Now
      then&mdash;all ready&mdash;all right with the barrow there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come along, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold hard, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam, raising the barrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick; and on they went, as briskly as need be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep that barrow back now,&rsquo; cried Wardle, when it had been hoisted over a
      stile into another field, and Mr. Pickwick had been deposited in it once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, pausing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Winkle,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, &lsquo;follow me softly, and don&rsquo;t be too
      late this time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never fear,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle. &lsquo;Are they pointing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; not now. Quietly now, quietly.&rsquo; On they crept, and very quietly
      they would have advanced, if Mr. Winkle, in the performance of some very
      intricate evolutions with his gun, had not accidentally fired, at the most
      critical moment, over the boy&rsquo;s head, exactly in the very spot where the
      tall man&rsquo;s brain would have been, had he been there instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what on earth did you do that for?&rsquo; said old Wardle, as the birds
      flew unharmed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never saw such a gun in my life,&rsquo; replied poor Mr. Winkle, looking at
      the lock, as if that would do any good. &lsquo;It goes off of its own accord. It
      <i>will </i>do it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will do it!&rsquo; echoed Wardle, with something of irritation in his manner.
      &lsquo;I wish it would kill something of its own accord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll do that afore long, Sir,&rsquo; observed the tall man, in a low,
      prophetic voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by that observation, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Winkle, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind, Sir, never mind,&rsquo; replied the long gamekeeper; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no
      family myself, sir; and this here boy&rsquo;s mother will get something handsome
      from Sir Geoffrey, if he&rsquo;s killed on his land. Load again, Sir, load
      again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take away his gun,&rsquo; cried Mr. Pickwick from the barrow, horror-stricken
      at the long man&rsquo;s dark insinuations. &lsquo;Take away his gun, do you hear,
      somebody?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody, however, volunteered to obey the command; and Mr. Winkle, after
      darting a rebellious glance at Mr. Pickwick, reloaded his gun, and
      proceeded onwards with the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are bound, on the authority of Mr. Pickwick, to state, that Mr.
      Tupman&rsquo;s mode of proceeding evinced far more of prudence and deliberation,
      than that adopted by Mr. Winkle. Still, this by no means detracts from the
      great authority of the latter gentleman, on all matters connected with the
      field; because, as Mr. Pickwick beautifully observes, it has somehow or
      other happened, from time immemorial, that many of the best and ablest
      philosophers, who have been perfect lights of science in matters of
      theory, have been wholly unable to reduce them to practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman&rsquo;s process, like many of our most sublime discoveries, was
      extremely simple. With the quickness and penetration of a man of genius,
      he had at once observed that the two great points to be attained were&mdash;first,
      to discharge his piece without injury to himself, and, secondly, to do so,
      without danger to the bystanders&mdash;obviously, the best thing to do,
      after surmounting the difficulty of firing at all, was to shut his eyes
      firmly, and fire into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion, after performing this feat, Mr. Tupman, on opening his
      eyes, beheld a plump partridge in the act of falling, wounded, to the
      ground. He was on the point of congratulating Mr. Wardle on his invariable
      success, when that gentleman advanced towards him, and grasped him warmly
      by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tupman,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, &lsquo;you singled out that particular bird?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman&mdash;&lsquo;no.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You did,&rsquo; said Wardle. &lsquo;I saw you do it&mdash;I observed you pick him out&mdash;I
      noticed you, as you raised your piece to take aim; and I will say this,
      that the best shot in existence could not have done it more beautifully.
      You are an older hand at this than I thought you, Tupman; you have been
      out before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain for Mr. Tupman to protest, with a smile of self-denial,
      that he never had. The very smile was taken as evidence to the contrary;
      and from that time forth his reputation was established. It is not the
      only reputation that has been acquired as easily, nor are such fortunate
      circumstances confined to partridge-shooting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mr. Winkle flashed, and blazed, and smoked away, without
      producing any material results worthy of being noted down; sometimes
      expending his charge in mid-air, and at others sending it skimming along
      so near the surface of the ground as to place the lives of the two dogs on
      a rather uncertain and precarious tenure. As a display of fancy-shooting,
      it was extremely varied and curious; as an exhibition of firing with any
      precise object, it was, upon the whole, perhaps a failure. It is an
      established axiom, that &lsquo;every bullet has its billet.&rsquo; If it apply in an
      equal degree to shot, those of Mr. Winkle were unfortunate foundlings,
      deprived of their natural rights, cast loose upon the world, and billeted
      nowhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Wardle, walking up to the side of the barrow, and wiping the
      streams of perspiration from his jolly red face; &lsquo;smoking day, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is, indeed,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. The sun is tremendously hot, even
      to me. I don&rsquo;t know how you must feel it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, &lsquo;pretty hot. It&rsquo;s past twelve, though. You
      see that green hill there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the place where we are to lunch; and, by Jove, there&rsquo;s the boy
      with the basket, punctual as clockwork!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So he is,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, brightening up. &lsquo;Good boy, that. I&rsquo;ll give
      him a shilling, presently. Now, then, Sam, wheel away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold on, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, invigorated with the prospect of
      refreshments. &lsquo;Out of the vay, young leathers. If you walley my precious
      life don&rsquo;t upset me, as the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n said to the driver when they was
      a-carryin&rsquo; him to Tyburn.&rsquo; And quickening his pace to a sharp run, Mr.
      Weller wheeled his master nimbly to the green hill, shot him dexterously
      out by the very side of the basket, and proceeded to unpack it with the
      utmost despatch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Weal pie,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, soliloquising, as he arranged the eatables on
      the grass. &lsquo;Wery good thing is weal pie, when you know the lady as made
      it, and is quite sure it ain&rsquo;t kittens; and arter all though, where&rsquo;s the
      odds, when they&rsquo;re so like weal that the wery piemen themselves don&rsquo;t know
      the difference?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t they, Sam?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not they, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, touching his hat. &lsquo;I lodged in the
      same house vith a pieman once, sir, and a wery nice man he was&mdash;reg&rsquo;lar
      clever chap, too&mdash;make pies out o&rsquo; anything, he could. &ldquo;What a number
      o&rsquo; cats you keep, Mr. Brooks,&rdquo; says I, when I&rsquo;d got intimate with him.
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I do&mdash;a good many,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;You must be wery fond
      o&rsquo; cats,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Other people is,&rdquo; says he, a-winkin&rsquo; at me; &ldquo;they ain&rsquo;t
      in season till the winter though,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Not in season!&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
       says he, &ldquo;fruits is in, cats is out.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, what do you mean?&rdquo; says I.
      &ldquo;Mean!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;That I&rsquo;ll never be a party to the combination o&rsquo; the
      butchers, to keep up the price o&rsquo; meat,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Mr. Weller,&rdquo; says he,
      a-squeezing my hand wery hard, and vispering in my ear&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      mention this here agin&mdash;but it&rsquo;s the seasonin&rsquo; as does it. They&rsquo;re
      all made o&rsquo; them noble animals,&rdquo; says he, a-pointin&rsquo; to a wery nice little
      tabby kitten, &ldquo;and I seasons &lsquo;em for beefsteak, weal or kidney, &lsquo;cording
      to the demand. And more than that,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I can make a weal a
      beef-steak, or a beef-steak a kidney, or any one on &lsquo;em a mutton, at a
      minute&rsquo;s notice, just as the market changes, and appetites wary!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must have been a very ingenious young man, that, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Pickwick, with a slight shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just was, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, continuing his occupation of emptying
      the basket, &lsquo;and the pies was beautiful. Tongue&mdash;, well that&rsquo;s a wery
      good thing when it ain&rsquo;t a woman&rsquo;s. Bread&mdash;knuckle o&rsquo; ham, reg&rsquo;lar
      picter&mdash;cold beef in slices, wery good. What&rsquo;s in them stone jars,
      young touch-and-go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beer in this one,&rsquo; replied the boy, taking from his shoulder a couple of
      large stone bottles, fastened together by a leathern strap&mdash;&lsquo;cold
      punch in t&rsquo;other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a wery good notion of a lunch it is, take it altogether,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Weller, surveying his arrangement of the repast with great satisfaction.
      &lsquo;Now, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, &ldquo;fall on,&rdquo; as the English said to the French when they
      fixed bagginets.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It needed no second invitation to induce the party to yield full justice
      to the meal; and as little pressing did it require to induce Mr. Weller,
      the long gamekeeper, and the two boys, to station themselves on the grass,
      at a little distance, and do good execution upon a decent proportion of
      the viands. An old oak afforded a pleasant shelter to the group, and a
      rich prospect of arable and meadow land, intersected with luxuriant
      hedges, and richly ornamented with wood, lay spread out before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is delightful&mdash;thoroughly delightful!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; the
      skin of whose expressive countenance was rapidly peeling off, with
      exposure to the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is&mdash;so it is, old fellow,&rsquo; replied Wardle. &lsquo;Come; a glass of
      punch!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With great pleasure,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; the satisfaction of whose
      countenance, after drinking it, bore testimony to the sincerity of the
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, smacking his lips. &lsquo;Very good. I&rsquo;ll take
      another. Cool; very cool. Come, gentlemen,&rsquo; continued Mr. Pickwick, still
      retaining his hold upon the jar, &lsquo;a toast. Our friends at Dingley Dell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The toast was drunk with loud acclamations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I shall do, to get up my shooting again,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Winkle, who was eating bread and ham with a pocket-knife. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll put a
      stuffed partridge on the top of a post, and practise at it, beginning at a
      short distance, and lengthening it by degrees. I understand it&rsquo;s capital
      practice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know a gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;man, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, &lsquo;as did that, and begun at two
      yards; but he never tried it on agin; for he blowed the bird right clean
      away at the first fire, and nobody ever seed a feather on him arterwards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have the goodness to reserve your anecdotes till they are called for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cert&rsquo;nly, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Weller winked the eye which was not concealed by the beer-can he
      was raising to his lips, with such exquisite facetiousness, that the two
      boys went into spontaneous convulsions, and even the long man condescended
      to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that certainly is most capital cold punch,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
      looking earnestly at the stone bottle; &lsquo;and the day is extremely warm, and&mdash;Tupman,
      my dear friend, a glass of punch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With the greatest delight,&rsquo; replied Mr. Tupman; and having drank that
      glass, Mr. Pickwick took another, just to see whether there was any orange
      peel in the punch, because orange peel always disagreed with him; and
      finding that there was not, Mr. Pickwick took another glass to the health
      of their absent friend, and then felt himself imperatively called upon to
      propose another in honour of the punch-compounder, unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      This constant succession of glasses produced considerable effect upon Mr.
      Pickwick; his countenance beamed with the most sunny smiles, laughter
      played around his lips, and good-humoured merriment twinkled in his eye.
      Yielding by degrees to the influence of the exciting liquid, rendered more
      so by the heat, Mr. Pickwick expressed a strong desire to recollect a song
      which he had heard in his infancy, and the attempt proving abortive,
      sought to stimulate his memory with more glasses of punch, which appeared
      to have quite a contrary effect; for, from forgetting the words of the
      song, he began to forget how to articulate any words at all; and finally,
      after rising to his legs to address the company in an eloquent speech, he
      fell into the barrow, and fast asleep, simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basket having been repacked, and it being found perfectly impossible
      to awaken Mr. Pickwick from his torpor, some discussion took place whether
      it would be better for Mr. Weller to wheel his master back again, or to
      leave him where he was, until they should all be ready to return. The
      latter course was at length decided on; and as the further expedition was
      not to exceed an hour&rsquo;s duration, and as Mr. Weller begged very hard to be
      one of the party, it was determined to leave Mr. Pickwick asleep in the
      barrow, and to call for him on their return. So away they went, leaving
      Mr. Pickwick snoring most comfortably in the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Mr. Pickwick would have continued to snore in the shade until his
      friends came back, or, in default thereof, until the shades of evening had
      fallen on the landscape, there appears no reasonable cause to doubt;
      always supposing that he had been suffered to remain there in peace. But
      he was <i>not </i>suffered to remain there in peace. And this was what
      prevented him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Boldwig was a little fierce man in a stiff black neckerchief and
      blue surtout, who, when he did condescend to walk about his property, did
      it in company with a thick rattan stick with a brass ferrule, and a
      gardener and sub-gardener with meek faces, to whom (the gardeners, not the
      stick) Captain Boldwig gave his orders with all due grandeur and ferocity;
      for Captain Boldwig&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s sister had married a marquis, and the
      captain&rsquo;s house was a villa, and his land &lsquo;grounds,&rsquo; and it was all very
      high, and mighty, and great.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick had not been asleep half an hour when little Captain Boldwig,
      followed by the two gardeners, came striding along as fast as his size and
      importance would let him; and when he came near the oak tree, Captain
      Boldwig paused and drew a long breath, and looked at the prospect as if he
      thought the prospect ought to be highly gratified at having him to take
      notice of it; and then he struck the ground emphatically with his stick,
      and summoned the head-gardener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hunt,&rsquo; said Captain Boldwig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Sir,&rsquo; said the gardener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Roll this place to-morrow morning&mdash;do you hear, Hunt?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And take care that you keep this place in good order&mdash;do you hear,
      Hunt?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And remind me to have a board done about trespassers, and spring guns,
      and all that sort of thing, to keep the common people out. Do you hear,
      Hunt; do you hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not forget it, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, Sir,&rsquo; said the other man, advancing, with his hand to
      his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Wilkins, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rsquo; said Captain Boldwig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir&mdash;but I think there have been trespassers here
      to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; said the captain, scowling around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir&mdash;they have been dining here, I think, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, damn their audacity, so they have,&rsquo; said Captain Boldwig, as the
      crumbs and fragments that were strewn upon the grass met his eye. &lsquo;They
      have actually been devouring their food here. I wish I had the vagabonds
      here!&rsquo; said the captain, clenching the thick stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I had the vagabonds here,&rsquo; said the captain wrathfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beg your pardon, sir,&rsquo; said Wilkins, &lsquo;but&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what? Eh?&rsquo; roared the captain; and following the timid glance of
      Wilkins, his eyes encountered the wheel-barrow and Mr. Pickwick.

      to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s body with the thick stick. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cold punch,&rsquo; murmured Mr. Pickwick, as he sank to sleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; demanded Captain Boldwig.
    </p>
    <p>
      No reply.

      &lsquo;What did he say his name was?&rsquo; asked the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Punch, I think, sir,&rsquo; replied Wilkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s his impudence&mdash;that&rsquo;s his confounded impudence,&rsquo; said Captain
      Boldwig. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s only feigning to be asleep now,&rsquo; said the captain, in a
      high passion. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s drunk; he&rsquo;s a drunken plebeian. Wheel him away,
      Wilkins, wheel him away directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Where shall I wheel him to, sir?&rsquo; inquired Wilkins, with great timidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wheel him to the devil,&rsquo; replied Captain Boldwig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, sir,&rsquo; said Wilkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay,&rsquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkins stopped accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wheel him,&rsquo; said the captain&mdash;&lsquo;wheel him to the pound; and let us
      see whether he calls himself Punch when he comes to himself. He shall not
      bully me&mdash;he shall not bully me. Wheel him away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Away Mr. Pickwick was wheeled in compliance with this imperious mandate;
      and the great Captain Boldwig, swelling with indignation, proceeded on his
      walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inexpressible was the astonishment of the little party when they returned,
      to find that Mr. Pickwick had disappeared, and taken the wheel-barrow with
      him. It was the most mysterious and unaccountable thing that was ever
      heard of. For a lame man to have got upon his legs without any previous
      notice, and walked off, would have been most extraordinary; but when it
      came to his wheeling a heavy barrow before him, by way of amusement, it
      grew positively miraculous. They searched every nook and corner round,
      together and separately; they shouted, whistled, laughed, called&mdash;and
      all with the same result. Mr. Pickwick was not to be found. After some
      hours of fruitless search, they arrived at the unwelcome conclusion that
      they must go home without him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mr. Pickwick had been wheeled to the Pound, and safely deposited
      therein, fast asleep in the wheel-barrow, to the immeasurable delight and
      satisfaction not only of all the boys in the village, but three-fourths of
      the whole population, who had gathered round, in expectation of his
      waking. If their most intense gratification had been awakened by seeing
      him wheeled in, how many hundredfold was their joy increased when, after a
      few indistinct cries of &lsquo;Sam!&rsquo; he sat up in the barrow, and gazed with
      indescribable astonishment on the faces before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A general shout was of course the signal of his having woke up; and his
      involuntary inquiry of &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; occasioned another, louder
      than the first, if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a game!&rsquo; roared the populace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where am I?&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the pound,&rsquo; replied the mob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How came I here? What was I doing? Where was I brought from?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Boldwig! Captain Boldwig!&rsquo; was the only reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me out,&rsquo; cried Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s my servant? Where are my
      friends?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ain&rsquo;t got no friends. Hurrah!&rsquo; Then there came a turnip, then a
      potato, and then an egg; with a few other little tokens of the playful
      disposition of the many-headed.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long this scene might have lasted, or how much Mr. Pickwick might have
      suffered, no one can tell, had not a carriage, which was driving swiftly
      by, suddenly pulled up, from whence there descended old Wardle and Sam
      Weller, the former of whom, in far less time than it takes to write it, if
      not to read it, had made his way to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s side, and placed him in
      the vehicle, just as the latter had concluded the third and last round of
      a single combat with the town-beadle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Run to the justice&rsquo;s!&rsquo; cried a dozen voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, run avay,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, jumping up on the box. &lsquo;Give my
      compliments&mdash;Mr. Veller&rsquo;s compliments&mdash;to the justice, and tell
      him I&rsquo;ve spiled his beadle, and that, if he&rsquo;ll swear in a new &lsquo;un, I&rsquo;ll
      come back again to-morrow and spile him. Drive on, old feller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give directions for the commencement of an action for false
      imprisonment against this Captain Boldwig, directly I get to London,&rsquo; said
      Mr. Pickwick, as soon as the carriage turned out of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We were trespassing, it seems,&rsquo; said Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bring the action.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will, by&mdash;&rsquo; But as there was a humorous expression in Wardle&rsquo;s
      face, Mr. Pickwick checked himself, and said, &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; said old Wardle, half-bursting with laughter, &lsquo;because they
      might turn on some of us, and say we had taken too much cold punch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Do what he would, a smile would come into Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s face; the smile
      extended into a laugh; the laugh into a roar; the roar became general. So,
      to keep up their good-humour, they stopped at the first roadside tavern
      they came to, and ordered a glass of brandy-and-water all round, with a
      magnum of extra strength for Mr. Samuel Weller.

      CHAPTER XX. SHOWING HOW DODSON AND FOGG WERE MEN OF BUSINESS, AND THEIR

      MR. WELLER AND HIS LONG-LOST PARENT; SHOWING ALSO WHAT CHOICE SPIRITS
      ASSEMBLED AT THE MAGPIE AND STUMP, AND WHAT A CAPITAL CHAPTER THE NEXT ONE
      WILL BE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the ground-floor
      front of a dingy house, at the very farthest end of Freeman&rsquo;s Court,
      Cornhill, sat the four clerks of Messrs. Dodson &amp; Fogg, two of his
      Majesty&rsquo;s attorneys of the courts of King&rsquo;s Bench and Common Pleas at
      Westminster, and solicitors of the High Court of Chancery&mdash;the
      aforesaid clerks catching as favourable glimpses of heaven&rsquo;s light and
      heaven&rsquo;s sun, in the course of their daily labours, as a man might hope to
      do, were he placed at the bottom of a reasonably deep well; and without
      the opportunity of perceiving the stars in the day-time, which the latter
      secluded situation affords.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerks&rsquo; office of Messrs. Dodson &amp; Fogg was a dark, mouldy,
      earthy-smelling room, with a high wainscotted partition to screen the
      clerks from the vulgar gaze, a couple of old wooden chairs, a very
      loud-ticking clock, an almanac, an umbrella-stand, a row of hat-pegs, and
      a few shelves, on which were deposited several ticketed bundles of dirty
      papers, some old deal boxes with paper labels, and sundry decayed stone
      ink bottles of various shapes and sizes. There was a glass door leading
      into the passage which formed the entrance to the court, and on the outer
      side of this glass door, Mr. Pickwick, closely followed by Sam Weller,
      presented himself on the Friday morning succeeding the occurrence of which
      a faithful narration is given in the last chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in, can&rsquo;t you!&rsquo; cried a voice from behind the partition, in reply to
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s gentle tap at the door. And Mr. Pickwick and Sam entered
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Dodson or Mr. Fogg at home, sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, gently,
      advancing, hat in hand, towards the partition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Dodson ain&rsquo;t at home, and Mr. Fogg&rsquo;s particularly engaged,&rsquo; replied
      the voice; and at the same time the head to which the voice belonged, with
      a pen behind its ear, looked over the partition, and at Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a ragged head, the sandy hair of which, scrupulously parted on one
      side, and flattened down with pomatum, was twisted into little
      semi-circular tails round a flat face ornamented with a pair of small
      eyes, and garnished with a very dirty shirt collar, and a rusty black
      stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Dodson ain&rsquo;t at home, and Mr. Fogg&rsquo;s particularly engaged,&rsquo; said the
      man to whom the head belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When will Mr. Dodson be back, sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will it be long before Mr. Fogg is disengaged, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the man proceeded to mend his pen with great deliberation, while
      another clerk, who was mixing a Seidlitz powder, under cover of the lid of
      his desk, laughed approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll wait,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. There was no reply; so Mr.
      Pickwick sat down unbidden, and listened to the loud ticking of the clock
      and the murmured conversation of the clerks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was a game, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; said one of the gentlemen, in a brown coat
      and brass buttons, inky drabs, and bluchers, at the conclusion of some
      inaudible relation of his previous evening&rsquo;s adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Devilish good&mdash;devilish good,&rsquo; said the Seidlitz-powder man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tom Cummins was in the chair,&rsquo; said the man with the brown coat. &lsquo;It was
      half-past four when I got to Somers Town, and then I was so uncommon
      lushy, that I couldn&rsquo;t find the place where the latch-key went in, and was
      obliged to knock up the old &lsquo;ooman. I say, I wonder what old Fogg &lsquo;ud say,
      if he knew it. I should get the sack, I s&rsquo;pose&mdash;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this humorous notion, all the clerks laughed in concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was such a game with Fogg here, this mornin&rsquo;,&rsquo; said the man in the
      brown coat, &lsquo;while Jack was upstairs sorting the papers, and you two were
      gone to the stamp-office. Fogg was down here, opening the letters when
      that chap as we issued the writ against at Camberwell, you know, came in&mdash;what&rsquo;s
      his name again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ramsey,&rsquo; said the clerk who had spoken to Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Ramsey&mdash;a precious seedy-looking customer. &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; says old
      Fogg, looking at him very fierce&mdash;you know his way&mdash;&ldquo;well, Sir,
      have you come to settle?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I have, sir,&rdquo; said Ramsey, putting his
      hand in his pocket, and bringing out the money, &ldquo;the debt&rsquo;s two pound ten,
      and the costs three pound five, and here it is, Sir;&rdquo; and he sighed like
      bricks, as he lugged out the money, done up in a bit of blotting-paper.
      Old Fogg looked first at the money, and then at him, and then he coughed
      in his rum way, so that I knew something was coming. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know
      there&rsquo;s a declaration filed, which increases the costs materially, I
      suppose,&rdquo; said Fogg. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say that, sir,&rdquo; said Ramsey, starting
      back; &ldquo;the time was only out last night, Sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;I do say it, though,&rdquo; said
      Fogg, &ldquo;my clerk&rsquo;s just gone to file it. Hasn&rsquo;t Mr. Jackson gone to file
      that declaration in Bullman and Ramsey, Mr. Wicks?&rdquo; Of course I said yes,
      and then Fogg coughed again, and looked at Ramsey. &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said Ramsey;
      &ldquo;and here have I nearly driven myself mad, scraping this money together,
      and all to no purpose.&rdquo; &ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; said Fogg coolly; &ldquo;so you had
      better go back and scrape some more together, and bring it here in time.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get it, by God!&rdquo; said Ramsey, striking the desk with his fist.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bully me, sir,&rdquo; said Fogg, getting into a passion on purpose. &ldquo;I am
      not bullying you, sir,&rdquo; said Ramsey. &ldquo;You are,&rdquo; said Fogg; &ldquo;get out, sir;
      get out of this office, Sir, and come back, Sir, when you know how to
      behave yourself.&rdquo; Well, Ramsey tried to speak, but Fogg wouldn&rsquo;t let him,
      so he put the money in his pocket, and sneaked out. The door was scarcely
      shut, when old Fogg turned round to me, with a sweet smile on his face,
      and drew the declaration out of his coat pocket. &ldquo;Here, Wicks,&rdquo; says Fogg,
      &ldquo;take a cab, and go down to the Temple as quick as you can, and file that.
      The costs are quite safe, for he&rsquo;s a steady man with a large family, at a
      salary of five-and-twenty shillings a week, and if he gives us a warrant
      of attorney, as he must in the end, I know his employers will see it paid;
      so we may as well get all we can get out of him, Mr. Wicks; it&rsquo;s a
      Christian act to do it, Mr. Wicks, for with his large family and small
      income, he&rsquo;ll be all the better for a good lesson against getting into
      debt&mdash;won&rsquo;t he, Mr. Wicks, won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;&mdash;and he smiled so
      good-naturedly as he went away, that it was delightful to see him. He is a
      capital man of business,&rsquo; said Wicks, in a tone of the deepest admiration,
      &lsquo;capital, isn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other three cordially subscribed to this opinion, and the anecdote
      afforded the most unlimited satisfaction.

    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nice men these here, Sir,&rsquo; whispered Mr. Weller to his master; &lsquo;wery nice
      notion of fun they has, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick nodded assent, and coughed to attract the attention of the
      young gentlemen behind the partition, who, having now relaxed their minds
      by a little conversation among themselves, condescended to take some
      notice of the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder whether Fogg&rsquo;s disengaged now?&rsquo; said Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see,&rsquo; said Wicks, dismounting leisurely from his stool. &lsquo;What name
      shall I tell Mr. Fogg?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pickwick,&rsquo; replied the illustrious subject of these memoirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jackson departed upstairs on his errand, and immediately returned with
      a message that Mr. Fogg would see Mr. Pickwick in five minutes; and having
      delivered it, returned again to his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did he say his name was?&rsquo; whispered Wicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pickwick,&rsquo; replied Jackson; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the defendant in Bardell and Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden scraping of feet, mingled with the sound of suppressed laughter,
      was heard from behind the partition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re a-twiggin&rsquo; of you, Sir,&rsquo; whispered Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twigging of me, Sam!&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;what do you mean by twigging
      me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller replied by pointing with his thumb over his shoulder, and Mr.
      Pickwick, on looking up, became sensible of the pleasing fact, that all
      the four clerks, with countenances expressive of the utmost amusement, and
      with their heads thrust over the wooden screen, were minutely inspecting
      the figure and general appearance of the supposed trifler with female
      hearts, and disturber of female happiness. On his looking up, the row of
      heads suddenly disappeared, and the sound of pens travelling at a furious
      rate over paper, immediately succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden ring at the bell which hung in the office, summoned Mr. Jackson
      to the apartment of Fogg, from whence he came back to say that he (Fogg)
      was ready to see Mr. Pickwick if he would step upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upstairs Mr. Pickwick did step accordingly, leaving Sam Weller below. The
      room door of the one-pair back, bore inscribed in legible characters the
      imposing words, &lsquo;Mr. Fogg&rsquo;; and, having tapped thereat, and been desired
      to come in, Jackson ushered Mr. Pickwick into the presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Mr. Dodson in?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Fogg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just come in, Sir,&rsquo; replied Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ask him to step here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo; Exit Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take a seat, sir,&rsquo; said Fogg; &lsquo;there is the paper, sir; my partner will
      be here directly, and we can converse about this matter, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick took a seat and the paper, but, instead of reading the
      latter, peeped over the top of it, and took a survey of the man of
      business, who was an elderly, pimply-faced, vegetable-diet sort of man, in
      a black coat, dark mixture trousers, and small black gaiters; a kind of
      being who seemed to be an essential part of the desk at which he was
      writing, and to have as much thought or feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few minutes&rsquo; silence, Mr. Dodson, a plump, portly, stern-looking
      man, with a loud voice, appeared; and the conversation commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Fogg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! You are the defendant, Sir, in Bardell and Pickwick?&rsquo; said Dodson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said Dodson, &lsquo;and what do you propose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Fogg, thrusting his hands into his trousers&rsquo; pockets, and
      throwing himself back in his chair, &lsquo;what do you propose, Mr Pickwick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, Fogg,&rsquo; said Dodson, &lsquo;let me hear what Mr. Pickwick has to say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, gazing placidly on the two
      partners, &lsquo;I came here, gentlemen, to express the surprise with which I
      received your letter of the other day, and to inquire what grounds of
      action you can have against me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grounds of&mdash;&rsquo; Fogg had ejaculated this much, when he was stopped by
      Dodson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Fogg,&rsquo; said Dodson, &lsquo;I am going to speak.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I beg your pardon, Mr. Dodson,&rsquo; said Fogg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For the grounds of action, sir,&rsquo; continued Dodson, with moral elevation
      in his air, &lsquo;you will consult your own conscience and your own feelings.
      We, Sir, we, are guided entirely by the statement of our client. That
      statement, Sir, may be true, or it may be false; it may be credible, or it
      may be incredible; but, if it be true, and if it be credible, I do not
      hesitate to say, Sir, that our grounds of action, Sir, are strong, and not
      to be shaken. You may be an unfortunate man, Sir, or you may be a
      designing one; but if I were called upon, as a juryman upon my oath, Sir,
      to express an opinion of your conduct, Sir, I do not hesitate to assert
      that I should have but one opinion about it.&rsquo; Here Dodson drew himself up,
      with an air of offended virtue, and looked at Fogg, who thrust his hands
      farther in his pockets, and nodding his head sagely, said, in a tone of
      the fullest concurrence, &lsquo;Most certainly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with considerable pain depicted in his
      countenance, &lsquo;you will permit me to assure you that I am a most
      unfortunate man, so far as this case is concerned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you are, Sir,&rsquo; replied Dodson; &lsquo;I trust you may be, Sir. If you
      are really innocent of what is laid to your charge, you are more
      unfortunate than I had believed any man could possibly be. What do you
      say, Mr. Fogg?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say precisely what you say,&rsquo; replied Fogg, with a smile of incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The writ, Sir, which commences the action,&rsquo; continued Dodson, &lsquo;was issued
      regularly. Mr. Fogg, where is the <i>Praecipe </i>book?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here it is,&rsquo; said Fogg, handing over a square book, with a parchment
      cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here is the entry,&rsquo; resumed Dodson. &lsquo;&ldquo;Middlesex, Capias MARTHA BARDELL,
      WIDOW, v. SAMUEL PICKWICK. Damages £1500. Dodson &amp; Fogg for the
      plaintiff, Aug. 28, 1827.&rdquo; All regular, Sir; perfectly.&rsquo; Dodson coughed
      and looked at Fogg, who said &lsquo;Perfectly,&rsquo; also. And then they both looked
      at Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am to understand, then,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;that it really is your
      intention to proceed with this action?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Understand, sir!&mdash;that you certainly may,&rsquo; replied Dodson, with
      something as near a smile as his importance would allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that the damages are actually laid at fifteen hundred pounds?&rsquo; said
      Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To which understanding you may add my assurance, that if we could have
      prevailed upon our client, they would have been laid at treble the amount,
      sir,&rsquo; replied Dodson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe Mrs. Bardell specially said, however,&rsquo; observed Fogg, glancing
      at Dodson, &lsquo;that she would not compromise for a farthing less.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unquestionably,&rsquo; replied Dodson sternly. For the action was only just
      begun; and it wouldn&rsquo;t have done to let Mr. Pickwick compromise it then,
      even if he had been so disposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you offer no terms, sir,&rsquo; said Dodson, displaying a slip of parchment
      in his right hand, and affectionately pressing a paper copy of it, on Mr.
      Pickwick with his left, &lsquo;I had better serve you with a copy of this writ,
      sir. Here is the original, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, gentlemen, very well,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, rising in person and
      wrath at the same time; &lsquo;you shall hear from my solicitor, gentlemen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall be very happy to do so,&rsquo; said Fogg, rubbing his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very,&rsquo; said Dodson, opening the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And before I go, gentlemen,&rsquo; said the excited Mr. Pickwick, turning round
      on the landing, &lsquo;permit me to say, that of all the disgraceful and
      rascally proceedings&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay, sir, stay,&rsquo; interposed Dodson, with great politeness. &lsquo;Mr. Jackson!
      Mr. Wicks!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said the two clerks, appearing at the bottom of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I merely want you to hear what this gentleman says,&rsquo; replied Dodson.
      &lsquo;Pray, go on, sir&mdash;disgraceful and rascally proceedings, I think you
      said?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, thoroughly roused. &lsquo;I said, Sir, that of all
      the disgraceful and rascally proceedings that ever were attempted, this is
      the most so. I repeat it, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You hear that, Mr. Wicks,&rsquo; said Dodson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t forget these expressions, Mr. Jackson?&rsquo; said Fogg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps you would like to call us swindlers, sir,&rsquo; said Dodson. &lsquo;Pray do,
      Sir, if you feel disposed; now pray do, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;You <i>are </i>swindlers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; said Dodson. &lsquo;You can hear down there, I hope, Mr. Wicks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, Sir,&rsquo; said Wicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better come up a step or two higher, if you can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; added Mr.
      Fogg. &lsquo;Go on, Sir; do go on. You had better call us thieves, Sir; or
      perhaps You would like to assault one of <i>us</i>. Pray do it, Sir, if
      you would; we will not make the smallest resistance. Pray do it, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Fogg put himself very temptingly within the reach of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      clenched fist, there is little doubt that that gentleman would have
      complied with his earnest entreaty, but for the interposition of Sam, who,
      hearing the dispute, emerged from the office, mounted the stairs, and
      seized his master by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You just come away,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Battledore and shuttlecock&rsquo;s a
      wery good game, vhen you ain&rsquo;t the shuttlecock and two lawyers the
      battledores, in which case it gets too excitin&rsquo; to be pleasant. Come avay,
      Sir. If you want to ease your mind by blowing up somebody, come out into
      the court and blow up me; but it&rsquo;s rayther too expensive work to be
      carried on here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And without the slightest ceremony, Mr. Weller hauled his master down the
      stairs, and down the court, and having safely deposited him in Cornhill,
      fell behind, prepared to follow whithersoever he should lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick walked on abstractedly, crossed opposite the Mansion House,
      and bent his steps up Cheapside. Sam began to wonder where they were
      going, when his master turned round, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam, I will go immediately to Mr. Perker&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s just exactly the wery place vere you ought to have gone last
      night, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it is, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I <i>know </i>it is,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, Sam,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;we will go there at once; but
      first, as I have been rather ruffled, I should like a glass of
      brandy-and-water warm, Sam. Where can I have it, Sam?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller&rsquo;s knowledge of London was extensive and peculiar. He replied,
      without the slightest consideration&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Second court on the right hand side&mdash;last house but vun on the same
      side the vay&mdash;take the box as stands in the first fireplace, &lsquo;cos
      there ain&rsquo;t no leg in the middle o&rsquo; the table, which all the others has,
      and it&rsquo;s wery inconvenient.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick observed his valet&rsquo;s directions implicitly, and bidding Sam
      follow him, entered the tavern he had pointed out, where the hot
      brandy-and-water was speedily placed before him; while Mr. Weller, seated
      at a respectful distance, though at the same table with his master, was
      accommodated with a pint of porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was one of a very homely description, and was apparently under
      the especial patronage of stage-coachmen; for several gentleman, who had
      all the appearance of belonging to that learned profession, were drinking
      and smoking in the different boxes. Among the number was one stout,
      red-faced, elderly man, in particular, seated in an opposite box, who
      attracted Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s attention. The stout man was smoking with great
      vehemence, but between every half-dozen puffs, he took his pipe from his
      mouth, and looked first at Mr. Weller and then at Mr. Pickwick. Then, he
      would bury in a quart pot, as much of his countenance as the dimensions of
      the quart pot admitted of its receiving, and take another look at Sam and
      Mr. Pickwick. Then he would take another half-dozen puffs with an air of
      profound meditation and look at them again. At last the stout man, putting
      up his legs on the seat, and leaning his back against the wall, began to
      puff at his pipe without leaving off at all, and to stare through the
      smoke at the new-comers, as if he had made up his mind to see the most he
      could of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the evolutions of the stout man had escaped Mr. Weller&rsquo;s
      observation, but by degrees, as he saw Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s eyes every now and
      then turning towards him, he began to gaze in the same direction, at the
      same time shading his eyes with his hand, as if he partially recognised
      the object before him, and wished to make quite sure of its identity. His
      doubts were speedily dispelled, however; for the stout man having blown a
      thick cloud from his pipe, a hoarse voice, like some strange effort of
      ventriloquism, emerged from beneath the capacious shawls which muffled his
      throat and chest, and slowly uttered these sounds&mdash;&lsquo;Wy, Sammy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that, Sam?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; believed it, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, with
      astonished eyes. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the old &lsquo;un.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old one,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;What old one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My father, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller. &lsquo;How are you, my ancient?&rsquo; And with
      this beautiful ebullition of filial affection, Mr. Weller made room on the
      seat beside him, for the stout man, who advanced pipe in mouth and pot in
      hand, to greet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wy, Sammy,&rsquo; said the father, &lsquo;I ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t seen you, for two year and
      better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor more you have, old codger,&rsquo; replied the son. &lsquo;How&rsquo;s mother-in-law?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wy, I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, senior, with much
      solemnity in his manner; &lsquo;there never was a nicer woman as a widder, than
      that &lsquo;ere second wentur o&rsquo; mine&mdash;a sweet creetur she was, Sammy; all
      I can say on her now, is, that as she was such an uncommon pleasant
      widder, it&rsquo;s a great pity she ever changed her condition. She don&rsquo;t act as
      a vife, Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Don&rsquo;t she, though?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller, junior.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Mr. Weller shook his head, as he replied with a sigh, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done
      it once too often, Sammy; I&rsquo;ve done it once too often. Take example by
      your father, my boy, and be wery careful o&rsquo; widders all your life,
      &lsquo;specially if they&rsquo;ve kept a public-house, Sammy.&rsquo; Having delivered this
      parental advice with great pathos, Mr. Weller, senior, refilled his pipe
      from a tin box he carried in his pocket; and, lighting his fresh pipe from
      the ashes of the old One, commenced smoking at a great rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beg your pardon, sir,&rsquo; he said, renewing the subject, and addressing Mr.
      Pickwick, after a considerable pause, &lsquo;nothin&rsquo; personal, I hope, sir; I
      hope you ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got a widder, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, laughing; and while Mr. Pickwick laughed,
      Sam Weller informed his parent in a whisper, of the relation in which he
      stood towards that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beg your pardon, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, senior, taking off his hat, &lsquo;I
      hope you&rsquo;ve no fault to find with Sammy, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None whatever,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery glad to hear it, sir,&rsquo; replied the old man; &lsquo;I took a good deal o&rsquo; 
      pains with his eddication, sir; let him run in the streets when he was
      wery young, and shift for hisself. It&rsquo;s the only way to make a boy sharp,
      sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather a dangerous process, I should imagine,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And not a wery sure one, neither,&rsquo; added Mr. Weller; &lsquo;I got reg&rsquo;larly
      done the other day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; said his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did,&rsquo; said the son; and he proceeded to relate, in as few words as
      possible, how he had fallen a ready dupe to the stratagems of Job Trotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller, senior, listened to the tale with the most profound attention,
      and, at its termination, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Worn&rsquo;t one o&rsquo; these chaps slim and tall, with long hair, and the gift o&rsquo; 
      the gab wery gallopin&rsquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick did not quite understand the last item of description, but,
      comprehending the first, said &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; at a venture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;T&rsquo; other&rsquo;s a black-haired chap in mulberry livery, with a wery large
      head?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, he is,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick and Sam, with great earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I know where they are, and that&rsquo;s all about it,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller;
      &lsquo;they&rsquo;re at Ipswich, safe enough, them two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fact,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you how I know it. I work an
      Ipswich coach now and then for a friend o&rsquo; mine. I worked down the wery
      day arter the night as you caught the rheumatic, and at the Black Boy at
      Chelmsford&mdash;the wery place they&rsquo;d come to&mdash;I took &lsquo;em up, right
      through to Ipswich, where the man-servant&mdash;him in the mulberries&mdash;told
      me they was a-goin&rsquo; to put up for a long time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll follow him,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;we may as well see Ipswich as any
      other place. I&rsquo;ll follow him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re quite certain it was them, governor?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller, junior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite, Sammy, quite,&rsquo; replied his father, &lsquo;for their appearance is wery
      sing&rsquo;ler; besides that &lsquo;ere, I wondered to see the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n so formiliar
      with his servant; and, more than that, as they sat in the front, right
      behind the box, I heerd &lsquo;em laughing and saying how they&rsquo;d done old
      Fireworks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old who?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old Fireworks, Sir; by which, I&rsquo;ve no doubt, they meant you, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing positively vile or atrocious in the appellation of &lsquo;old
      Fireworks,&rsquo; but still it is by no means a respectful or flattering
      designation. The recollection of all the wrongs he had sustained at
      Jingle&rsquo;s hands, had crowded on Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s mind, the moment Mr. Weller
      began to speak; it wanted but a feather to turn the scale, and &lsquo;old
      Fireworks&rsquo; did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll follow him,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with an emphatic blow on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall work down to Ipswich the day arter to-morrow, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Weller the elder, &lsquo;from the Bull in Whitechapel; and if you really mean to
      go, you&rsquo;d better go with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So we had,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;very true; I can write to Bury, and tell
      them to meet me at Ipswich. We will go with you. But don&rsquo;t hurry away, Mr.
      Weller; won&rsquo;t you take anything?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re wery good, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. W., stopping short;&mdash;&lsquo;perhaps a
      small glass of brandy to drink your health, and success to Sammy, Sir,
      wouldn&rsquo;t be amiss.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A glass of brandy here!&rsquo; The brandy was brought; and Mr. Weller, after
      pulling his hair to Mr. Pickwick, and nodding to Sam, jerked it down his
      capacious throat as if it had been a small thimbleful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well done, father,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;take care, old fellow, or you&rsquo;ll have a
      touch of your old complaint, the gout.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve found a sov&rsquo;rin&rsquo; cure for that, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, setting
      down the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A sovereign cure for the gout,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, hastily producing his
      note-book&mdash;&lsquo;what is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The gout, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, &lsquo;the gout is a complaint as arises
      from too much ease and comfort. If ever you&rsquo;re attacked with the gout,
      sir, jist you marry a widder as has got a good loud woice, with a decent
      notion of usin&rsquo; it, and you&rsquo;ll never have the gout agin. It&rsquo;s a capital
      prescription, sir. I takes it reg&rsquo;lar, and I can warrant it to drive away
      any illness as is caused by too much jollity.&rsquo; Having imparted this
      valuable secret, Mr. Weller drained his glass once more, produced a
      laboured wink, sighed deeply, and slowly retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what do you think of what your father says, Sam?&rsquo; inquired Mr.
      Pickwick, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think, Sir!&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; &lsquo;why, I think he&rsquo;s the wictim o&rsquo; 
      connubiality, as Blue Beard&rsquo;s domestic chaplain said, vith a tear of pity,
      ven he buried him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no replying to this very apposite conclusion, and, therefore,
      Mr. Pickwick, after settling the reckoning, resumed his walk to Gray&rsquo;s
      Inn. By the time he reached its secluded groves, however, eight o&rsquo;clock
      had struck, and the unbroken stream of gentlemen in muddy high-lows,
      soiled white hats, and rusty apparel, who were pouring towards the
      different avenues of egress, warned him that the majority of the offices
      had closed for that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      After climbing two pairs of steep and dirty stairs, he found his
      anticipations were realised. Mr. Perker&rsquo;s &lsquo;outer door&rsquo; was closed; and the
      dead silence which followed Mr. Weller&rsquo;s repeated kicks thereat, announced
      that the officials had retired from business for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is pleasant, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t lose an hour in
      seeing him; I shall not be able to get one wink of sleep to-night, I know,
      unless I have the satisfaction of reflecting that I have confided this
      matter to a professional man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s an old &lsquo;ooman comin&rsquo; upstairs, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; &lsquo;p&rsquo;raps
      she knows where we can find somebody. Hollo, old lady, vere&rsquo;s Mr. Perker&rsquo;s
      people?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Perker&rsquo;s people,&rsquo; said a thin, miserable-looking old woman, stopping
      to recover breath after the ascent of the staircase&mdash;&lsquo;Mr. Perker&rsquo;s
      people&rsquo;s gone, and I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to do the office out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you Mr. Perker&rsquo;s servant?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am Mr. Perker&rsquo;s laundress,&rsquo; replied the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, half aside to Sam, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a curious circumstance,
      Sam, that they call the old women in these inns, laundresses. I wonder
      what&rsquo;s that for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Cos they has a mortal awersion to washing anythin&rsquo;, I suppose, Sir,&rsquo; 
      replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking at the old woman, whose
      appearance, as well as the condition of the office, which she had by this
      time opened, indicated a rooted antipathy to the application of soap and
      water; &lsquo;do you know where I can find Mr. Perker, my good woman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied the old woman gruffly; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s out o&rsquo; town now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s unfortunate,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;where&rsquo;s his clerk? Do you know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I know where he is, but he won&rsquo;t thank me for telling you,&rsquo; replied
      the laundress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have very particular business with him,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t it do in the morning?&rsquo; said the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not so well,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the old woman, &lsquo;if it was anything very particular, I was to
      say where he was, so I suppose there&rsquo;s no harm in telling. If you just go
      to the Magpie and Stump, and ask at the bar for Mr. Lowten, they&rsquo;ll show
      you in to him, and he&rsquo;s Mr. Perker&rsquo;s clerk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this direction, and having been furthermore informed that the
      hostelry in question was situated in a court, happy in the double
      advantage of being in the vicinity of Clare Market, and closely
      approximating to the back of New Inn, Mr. Pickwick and Sam descended the
      rickety staircase in safety, and issued forth in quest of the Magpie and
      Stump.
    </p>
    <p>
      This favoured tavern, sacred to the evening orgies of Mr. Lowten and his
      companions, was what ordinary people would designate a public-house. That
      the landlord was a man of money-making turn was sufficiently testified by
      the fact of a small bulkhead beneath the tap-room window, in size and
      shape not unlike a sedan-chair, being underlet to a mender of shoes: and
      that he was a being of a philanthropic mind was evident from the
      protection he afforded to a pieman, who vended his delicacies without fear
      of interruption, on the very door-step. In the lower windows, which were
      decorated with curtains of a saffron hue, dangled two or three printed
      cards, bearing reference to Devonshire cider and Dantzic spruce, while a
      large blackboard, announcing in white letters to an enlightened public,
      that there were 500,000 barrels of double stout in the cellars of the
      establishment, left the mind in a state of not unpleasing doubt and
      uncertainty as to the precise direction in the bowels of the earth, in
      which this mighty cavern might be supposed to extend. When we add that the
      weather-beaten signboard bore the half-obliterated semblance of a magpie
      intently eyeing a crooked streak of brown paint, which the neighbours had
      been taught from infancy to consider as the &lsquo;stump,&rsquo; we have said all that
      need be said of the exterior of the edifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s presenting himself at the bar, an elderly female emerged
      from behind the screen therein, and presented herself before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Mr. Lowten here, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he is, Sir,&rsquo; replied the landlady. &lsquo;Here, Charley, show the
      gentleman in to Mr. Lowten.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n can&rsquo;t go in just now,&rsquo; said a shambling pot-boy, with a red
      head, &lsquo;cos&rsquo; Mr. Lowten&rsquo;s a-singin&rsquo; a comic song, and he&rsquo;ll put him out.
      He&rsquo;ll be done directly, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The red-headed pot-boy had scarcely finished speaking, when a most
      unanimous hammering of tables, and jingling of glasses, announced that the
      song had that instant terminated; and Mr. Pickwick, after desiring Sam to
      solace himself in the tap, suffered himself to be conducted into the
      presence of Mr. Lowten.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the announcement of &lsquo;A gentleman to speak to you, Sir,&rsquo; a puffy-faced
      young man, who filled the chair at the head of the table, looked with some
      surprise in the direction from whence the voice proceeded; and the
      surprise seemed to be by no means diminished, when his eyes rested on an
      individual whom he had never seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;and I am very sorry to
      disturb the other gentlemen, too, but I come on very particular business;
      and if you will suffer me to detain you at this end of the room for five
      minutes, I shall be very much obliged to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The puffy-faced young man rose, and drawing a chair close to Mr. Pickwick
      in an obscure corner of the room, listened attentively to his tale of woe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; he said, when Mr. Pickwick had concluded, &lsquo;Dodson and Fogg&mdash;sharp
      practice theirs&mdash;capital men of business, Dodson and Fogg, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick admitted the sharp practice of Dodson and Fogg, and Lowten
      resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perker ain&rsquo;t in town, and he won&rsquo;t be, neither, before the end of next
      week; but if you want the action defended, and will leave the copy with
      me, I can do all that&rsquo;s needful till he comes back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I came here for,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, handing over the
      document. &lsquo;If anything particular occurs, you can write to me at the
      post-office, Ipswich.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; replied Mr. Perker&rsquo;s clerk; and then seeing Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s eye wandering curiously towards the table, he added, &lsquo;will you
      join us, for half an hour or so? We are capital company here to-night.
      There&rsquo;s Samkin and Green&rsquo;s managing-clerk, and Smithers and Price&rsquo;s
      chancery, and Pimkin and Thomas&rsquo;s out o&rsquo; doors&mdash;sings a capital song,
      he does&mdash;and Jack Bamber, and ever so many more. You&rsquo;re come out of
      the country, I suppose. Would you like to join us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick could not resist so tempting an opportunity of studying human
      nature. He suffered himself to be led to the table, where, after having
      been introduced to the company in due form, he was accommodated with a
      seat near the chairman and called for a glass of his favourite beverage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A profound silence, quite contrary to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s expectation,
      succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t find this sort of thing disagreeable, I hope, sir?&rsquo; said his
      right hand neighbour, a gentleman in a checked shirt and Mosaic studs,
      with a cigar in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not in the least,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;I like it very much, although I
      am no smoker myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be very sorry to say I wasn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; interposed another gentleman on
      the opposite side of the table. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s board and lodgings to me, is smoke.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick glanced at the speaker, and thought that if it were washing
      too, it would be all the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there was another pause. Mr. Pickwick was a stranger, and his coming
      had evidently cast a damp upon the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Grundy&rsquo;s going to oblige the company with a song,&rsquo; said the chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Mr. Grundy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; said the chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because he can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Mr. Grundy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better say he won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied the chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, he won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; retorted Mr. Grundy. Mr. Grundy&rsquo;s positive refusal
      to gratify the company occasioned another silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t anybody enliven us?&rsquo; said the chairman, despondingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you enliven us yourself, Mr. Chairman?&rsquo; said a young man with a
      whisker, a squint, and an open shirt collar (dirty), from the bottom of
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear! hear!&rsquo; said the smoking gentleman, in the Mosaic jewellery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I only know one song, and I have sung it already, and it&rsquo;s a fine
      of &ldquo;glasses round&rdquo; to sing the same song twice in a night,&rsquo; replied the
      chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an unanswerable reply, and silence prevailed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been to-night, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, hoping to start a
      subject which all the company could take a part in discussing, &lsquo;I have
      been to-night, in a place which you all know very well, doubtless, but
      which I have not been in for some years, and know very little of; I mean
      Gray&rsquo;s Inn, gentlemen. Curious little nooks in a great place, like London,
      these old inns are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By Jove!&rsquo; said the chairman, whispering across the table to Mr. Pickwick,
      &lsquo;you have hit upon something that one of us, at least, would talk upon for
      ever. You&rsquo;ll draw old Jack Bamber out; he was never heard to talk about
      anything else but the inns, and he has lived alone in them till he&rsquo;s half
      crazy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The individual to whom Lowten alluded, was a little, yellow,
      high-shouldered man, whose countenance, from his habit of stooping forward
      when silent, Mr. Pickwick had not observed before. He wondered, though,
      when the old man raised his shrivelled face, and bent his gray eye upon
      him, with a keen inquiring look, that such remarkable features could have
      escaped his attention for a moment. There was a fixed grim smile
      perpetually on his countenance; he leaned his chin on a long, skinny hand,
      with nails of extraordinary length; and as he inclined his head to one
      side, and looked keenly out from beneath his ragged gray eyebrows, there
      was a strange, wild slyness in his leer, quite repulsive to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the figure that now started forward, and burst into an animated
      torrent of words. As this chapter has been a long one, however, and as the
      old man was a remarkable personage, it will be more respectful to him, and
      more convenient to us, to let him speak for himself in a fresh one.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. IN WHICH THE OLD MAN LAUNCHES FORTH INTO HIS FAVOURITE THEME,
      AND RELATES A STORY ABOUT A QUEER CLIENT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&rsquo; A</span>ha!&rsquo; said the old
      man, a brief description of whose manner and appearance concluded the last
      chapter, &lsquo;aha! who was talking about the inns?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick&mdash;&lsquo;I was observing what singular
      old places they are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>You</i>!&rsquo; said the old man contemptuously. &lsquo;What do <i>you </i>know of
      the time when young men shut themselves up in those lonely rooms, and read
      and read, hour after hour, and night after night, till their reason
      wandered beneath their midnight studies; till their mental powers were
      exhausted; till morning&rsquo;s light brought no freshness or health to them;
      and they sank beneath the unnatural devotion of their youthful energies to
      their dry old books? Coming down to a later time, and a very different
      day, what do <i>you</i> know of the gradual sinking beneath consumption,
      or the quick wasting of fever&mdash;the grand results of &ldquo;life&rdquo; and
      dissipation&mdash;which men have undergone in these same rooms? How many
      vain pleaders for mercy, do you think, have turned away heart-sick from
      the lawyer&rsquo;s office, to find a resting-place in the Thames, or a refuge in
      the jail? They are no ordinary houses, those. There is not a panel in the
      old wainscotting, but what, if it were endowed with the powers of speech
      and memory, could start from the wall, and tell its tale of horror&mdash;the
      romance of life, Sir, the romance of life! Common-place as they may seem
      now, I tell you they are strange old places, and I would rather hear many
      a legend with a terrific-sounding name, than the true history of one old
      set of chambers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something so odd in the old man&rsquo;s sudden energy, and the subject
      which had called it forth, that Mr. Pickwick was prepared with no
      observation in reply; and the old man checking his impetuosity, and
      resuming the leer, which had disappeared during his previous excitement,
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look at them in another light&mdash;their most common-place and least
      romantic. What fine places of slow torture they are! Think of the needy
      man who has spent his all, beggared himself, and pinched his friends, to
      enter the profession, which is destined never to yield him a morsel of
      bread. The waiting&mdash;the hope&mdash;the disappointment&mdash;the fear&mdash;the
      misery&mdash;the poverty&mdash;the blight on his hopes, and end to his
      career&mdash;the suicide perhaps, or the shabby, slipshod drunkard. Am I
      not right about them?&rsquo; And the old man rubbed his hands, and leered as if
      in delight at having found another point of view in which to place his
      favourite subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick eyed the old man with great curiosity, and the remainder of
      the company smiled, and looked on in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Talk of your German universities,&rsquo; said the little old man. &lsquo;Pooh, pooh!
      there&rsquo;s romance enough at home without going half a mile for it; only
      people never think of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never thought of the romance of this particular subject before,
      certainly,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure you didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the little old man; &lsquo;of course not. As a
      friend of mine used to say to me, &ldquo;What is there in chambers in
      particular?&rdquo; &ldquo;Queer old places,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Lonely,&rdquo;
       said I. &ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; said he. He died one morning of apoplexy, as he
      was going to open his outer door. Fell with his head in his own
      letter-box, and there he lay for eighteen months. Everybody thought he&rsquo;d
      gone out of town.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how was he found out at last?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The benchers determined to have his door broken open, as he hadn&rsquo;t paid
      any rent for two years. So they did. Forced the lock; and a very dusty
      skeleton in a blue coat, black knee-shorts, and silks, fell forward in the
      arms of the porter who opened the door. Queer, that. Rather, perhaps;
      rather, eh?&rsquo; The little old man put his head more on one side, and rubbed
      his hands with unspeakable glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know another case,&rsquo; said the little old man, when his chuckles had in
      some degree subsided. &lsquo;It occurred in Clifford&rsquo;s Inn. Tenant of a top set&mdash;bad
      character&mdash;shut himself up in his bedroom closet, and took a dose of
      arsenic. The steward thought he had run away: opened the door, and put a
      bill up. Another man came, took the chambers, furnished them, and went to
      live there. Somehow or other he couldn&rsquo;t sleep&mdash;always restless and
      uncomfortable. &ldquo;Odd,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make the other room my bedchamber,
      and this my sitting-room.&rdquo; He made the change, and slept very well at
      night, but suddenly found that, somehow, he couldn&rsquo;t read in the evening:
      he got nervous and uncomfortable, and used to be always snuffing his
      candles and staring about him. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make this out,&rdquo; said he, when he
      came home from the play one night, and was drinking a glass of cold grog,
      with his back to the wall, in order that he mightn&rsquo;t be able to fancy
      there was any one behind him&mdash;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it out,&rdquo; said he; and
      just then his eyes rested on the little closet that had been always locked
      up, and a shudder ran through his whole frame from top to toe. &ldquo;I have
      felt this strange feeling before,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I cannot help thinking
      there&rsquo;s something wrong about that closet.&rdquo; He made a strong effort,
      plucked up his courage, shivered the lock with a blow or two of the poker,
      opened the door, and there, sure enough, standing bolt upright in the
      corner, was the last tenant, with a little bottle clasped firmly in his
      hand, and his face&mdash;well!&rsquo; As the little old man concluded, he looked
      round on the attentive faces of his wondering auditory with a smile of
      grim delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What strange things these are you tell us of, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
      minutely scanning the old man&rsquo;s countenance, by the aid of his glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Strange!&rsquo; said the little old man. &lsquo;Nonsense; you think them strange,
      because you know nothing about it. They are funny, but not uncommon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Funny!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, funny, are they not?&rsquo; replied the little old man, with a diabolical
      leer; and then, without pausing for an answer, he continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew another man&mdash;let me see&mdash;forty years ago now&mdash;who
      took an old, damp, rotten set of chambers, in one of the most ancient
      inns, that had been shut up and empty for years and years before. There
      were lots of old women&rsquo;s stories about the place, and it certainly was
      very far from being a cheerful one; but he was poor, and the rooms were
      cheap, and that would have been quite a sufficient reason for him, if they
      had been ten times worse than they really were. He was obliged to take
      some mouldering fixtures that were on the place, and, among the rest, was
      a great lumbering wooden press for papers, with large glass doors, and a
      green curtain inside; a pretty useless thing for him, for he had no papers
      to put in it; and as to his clothes, he carried them about with him, and
      that wasn&rsquo;t very hard work, either. Well, he had moved in all his
      furniture&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t quite a truck-full&mdash;and had sprinkled it
      about the room, so as to make the four chairs look as much like a dozen as
      possible, and was sitting down before the fire at night, drinking the
      first glass of two gallons of whisky he had ordered on credit, wondering
      whether it would ever be paid for, and if so, in how many years&rsquo; time,
      when his eyes encountered the glass doors of the wooden press. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; says
      he, &ldquo;if I hadn&rsquo;t been obliged to take that ugly article at the old
      broker&rsquo;s valuation, I might have got something comfortable for the money.
      I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, old fellow,&rdquo; he said, speaking aloud to the
      press, having nothing else to speak to, &ldquo;if it wouldn&rsquo;t cost more to break
      up your old carcass, than it would ever be worth afterward, I&rsquo;d have a
      fire out of you in less than no time.&rdquo; He had hardly spoken the words,
      when a sound resembling a faint groan, appeared to issue from the interior
      of the case. It startled him at first, but thinking, on a moment&rsquo;s
      reflection, that it must be some young fellow in the next chamber, who had
      been dining out, he put his feet on the fender, and raised the poker to
      stir the fire. At that moment, the sound was repeated; and one of the
      glass doors slowly opening, disclosed a pale and emaciated figure in
      soiled and worn apparel, standing erect in the press. The figure was tall
      and thin, and the countenance expressive of care and anxiety; but there
      was something in the hue of the skin, and gaunt and unearthly appearance
      of the whole form, which no being of this world was ever seen to wear.
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said the new tenant, turning very pale; poising the poker
      in his hand, however, and taking a very decent aim at the countenance of
      the figure. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t throw that poker at me,&rdquo; replied the
      form; &ldquo;if you hurled it with ever so sure an aim, it would pass through
      me, without resistance, and expend its force on the wood behind. I am a
      spirit.&rdquo; &ldquo;And pray, what do you want here?&rdquo; faltered the tenant. &ldquo;In this
      room,&rdquo; replied the apparition, &ldquo;my worldly ruin was worked, and I and my
      children beggared. In this press, the papers in a long, long suit, which
      accumulated for years, were deposited. In this room, when I had died of
      grief, and long-deferred hope, two wily harpies divided the wealth for
      which I had contested during a wretched existence, and of which, at last,
      not one farthing was left for my unhappy descendants. I terrified them
      from the spot, and since that day have prowled by night&mdash;the only
      period at which I can revisit the earth&mdash;about the scenes of my
      long-protracted misery. This apartment is mine: leave it to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;If you
      insist upon making your appearance here,&rdquo; said the tenant, who had had
      time to collect his presence of mind during this prosy statement of the
      ghost&rsquo;s, &ldquo;I shall give up possession with the greatest pleasure; but I
      should like to ask you one question, if you will allow me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Say on,&rdquo; said
      the apparition sternly. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the tenant, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t apply the
      observation personally to you, because it is equally applicable to most of
      the ghosts I ever heard of; but it does appear to me somewhat
      inconsistent, that when you have an opportunity of visiting the fairest
      spots of earth&mdash;for I suppose space is nothing to you&mdash;you
      should always return exactly to the very places where you have been most
      miserable.&rdquo; &ldquo;Egad, that&rsquo;s very true; I never thought of that before,&rdquo; said
      the ghost. &ldquo;You see, Sir,&rdquo; pursued the tenant, &ldquo;this is a very
      uncomfortable room. From the appearance of that press, I should be
      disposed to say that it is not wholly free from bugs; and I really think
      you might find much more comfortable quarters: to say nothing of the
      climate of London, which is extremely disagreeable.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are very right,
      Sir,&rdquo; said the ghost politely, &ldquo;it never struck me till now; I&rsquo;ll try
      change of air directly&rdquo;&mdash;and, in fact, he began to vanish as he
      spoke; his legs, indeed, had quite disappeared. &ldquo;And if, Sir,&rdquo; said the
      tenant, calling after him, &ldquo;if you <i>would </i>have the goodness to
      suggest to the other ladies and gentlemen who are now engaged in haunting
      old empty houses, that they might be much more comfortable elsewhere, you
      will confer a very great benefit on society.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied the ghost;
      &ldquo;we must be dull fellows&mdash;very dull fellows, indeed; I can&rsquo;t imagine
      how we can have been so stupid.&rdquo; With these words, the spirit disappeared;
      and what is rather remarkable,&rsquo; added the old man, with a shrewd look
      round the table, &lsquo;he never came back again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That ain&rsquo;t bad, if it&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; said the man in the Mosaic studs, lighting
      a fresh cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>If</i>!&rsquo; exclaimed the old man, with a look of excessive contempt. &lsquo;I
      suppose,&rsquo; he added, turning to Lowten, &lsquo;he&rsquo;ll say next, that my story
      about the queer client we had, when I was in an attorney&rsquo;s office, is not
      true either&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t venture to say anything at all about it, seeing that I never
      heard the story,&rsquo; observed the owner of the Mosaic decorations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you would repeat it, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, do,&rsquo; said Lowten, &lsquo;nobody has heard it but me, and I have nearly
      forgotten it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked round the table, and leered more horribly than ever, as
      if in triumph, at the attention which was depicted in every face. Then
      rubbing his chin with his hand, and looking up to the ceiling as if to
      recall the circumstances to his memory, he began as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  THE OLD MAN&rsquo;S TALE ABOUT THE QUEER CLIENT
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It matters little,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;where, or how, I picked up this
      brief history. If I were to relate it in the order in which it reached me,
      I should commence in the middle, and when I had arrived at the conclusion,
      go back for a beginning. It is enough for me to say that some of its
      circumstances passed before my own eyes; for the remainder I know them to
      have happened, and there are some persons yet living, who will remember
      them but too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the Borough High Street, near St. George&rsquo;s Church, and on the same
      side of the way, stands, as most people know, the smallest of our debtors&rsquo; 
      prisons, the Marshalsea. Although in later times it has been a very
      different place from the sink of filth and dirt it once was, even its
      improved condition holds out but little temptation to the extravagant, or
      consolation to the improvident. The condemned felon has as good a yard for
      air and exercise in Newgate, as the insolvent debtor in the Marshalsea
      Prison. [Better. But this is past, in a better age, and the prison exists
      no longer.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may be my fancy, or it may be that I cannot separate the place from
      the old recollections associated with it, but this part of London I cannot
      bear. The street is broad, the shops are spacious, the noise of passing
      vehicles, the footsteps of a perpetual stream of people&mdash;all the busy
      sounds of traffic, resound in it from morn to midnight; but the streets
      around are mean and close; poverty and debauchery lie festering in the
      crowded alleys; want and misfortune are pent up in the narrow prison; an
      air of gloom and dreariness seems, in my eyes at least, to hang about the
      scene, and to impart to it a squalid and sickly hue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Many eyes, that have long since been closed in the grave, have looked
      round upon that scene lightly enough, when entering the gate of the old
      Marshalsea Prison for the first time; for despair seldom comes with the
      first severe shock of misfortune. A man has confidence in untried friends,
      he remembers the many offers of service so freely made by his boon
      companions when he wanted them not; he has hope&mdash;the hope of happy
      inexperience&mdash;and however he may bend beneath the first shock, it
      springs up in his bosom, and flourishes there for a brief space, until it
      droops beneath the blight of disappointment and neglect. How soon have
      those same eyes, deeply sunken in the head, glared from faces wasted with
      famine, and sallow from confinement, in days when it was no figure of
      speech to say that debtors rotted in prison, with no hope of release, and
      no prospect of liberty! The atrocity in its full extent no longer exists,
      but there is enough of it left to give rise to occurrences that make the
      heart bleed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twenty years ago, that pavement was worn with the footsteps of a mother
      and child, who, day by day, so surely as the morning came, presented
      themselves at the prison gate; often after a night of restless misery and
      anxious thoughts, were they there, a full hour too soon, and then the
      young mother turning meekly away, would lead the child to the old bridge,
      and raising him in her arms to show him the glistening water, tinted with
      the light of the morning&rsquo;s sun, and stirring with all the bustling
      preparations for business and pleasure that the river presented at that
      early hour, endeavour to interest his thoughts in the objects before him.
      But she would quickly set him down, and hiding her face in her shawl, give
      vent to the tears that blinded her; for no expression of interest or
      amusement lighted up his thin and sickly face. His recollections were few
      enough, but they were all of one kind&mdash;all connected with the poverty
      and misery of his parents. Hour after hour had he sat on his mother&rsquo;s
      knee, and with childish sympathy watched the tears that stole down her
      face, and then crept quietly away into some dark corner, and sobbed
      himself to sleep. The hard realities of the world, with many of its worst
      privations&mdash;hunger and thirst, and cold and want&mdash;had all come
      home to him, from the first dawnings of reason; and though the form of
      childhood was there, its light heart, its merry laugh, and sparkling eyes
      were wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The father and mother looked on upon this, and upon each other, with
      thoughts of agony they dared not breathe in words. The healthy,
      strong-made man, who could have borne almost any fatigue of active
      exertion, was wasting beneath the close confinement and unhealthy
      atmosphere of a crowded prison. The slight and delicate woman was sinking
      beneath the combined effects of bodily and mental illness. The child&rsquo;s
      young heart was breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Winter came, and with it weeks of cold and heavy rain. The poor girl had
      removed to a wretched apartment close to the spot of her husband&rsquo;s
      imprisonment; and though the change had been rendered necessary by their
      increasing poverty, she was happier now, for she was nearer him. For two
      months, she and her little companion watched the opening of the gate as
      usual. One day she failed to come, for the first time. Another morning
      arrived, and she came alone. The child was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They little know, who coldly talk of the poor man&rsquo;s bereavements, as a
      happy release from pain to the departed, and a merciful relief from
      expense to the survivor&mdash;they little know, I say, what the agony of
      those bereavements is. A silent look of affection and regard when all
      other eyes are turned coldly away&mdash;the consciousness that we possess
      the sympathy and affection of one being when all others have deserted us&mdash;is
      a hold, a stay, a comfort, in the deepest affliction, which no wealth
      could purchase, or power bestow. The child had sat at his parents&rsquo; feet
      for hours together, with his little hands patiently folded in each other,
      and his thin wan face raised towards them. They had seen him pine away,
      from day to day; and though his brief existence had been a joyless one,
      and he was now removed to that peace and rest which, child as he was, he
      had never known in this world, they were his parents, and his loss sank
      deep into their souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was plain to those who looked upon the mother&rsquo;s altered face, that
      death must soon close the scene of her adversity and trial. Her husband&rsquo;s
      fellow-prisoners shrank from obtruding on his grief and misery, and left
      to himself alone, the small room he had previously occupied in common with
      two companions. She shared it with him; and lingering on without pain, but
      without hope, her life ebbed slowly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She had fainted one evening in her husband&rsquo;s arms, and he had borne her
      to the open window, to revive her with the air, when the light of the moon
      falling full upon her face, showed him a change upon her features, which
      made him stagger beneath her weight, like a helpless infant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Set me down, George,&rdquo; she said faintly. He did so, and seating himself
      beside her, covered his face with his hands, and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;It is very hard to leave you, George,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but it is God&rsquo;s will,
      and you must bear it for my sake. Oh! how I thank Him for having taken our
      boy! He is happy, and in heaven now. What would he have done here, without
      his mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You shall not die, Mary, you shall not die;&rdquo; said the husband, starting
      up. He paced hurriedly to and fro, striking his head with his clenched
      fists; then reseating himself beside her, and supporting her in his arms,
      added more calmly, &ldquo;Rouse yourself, my dear girl. Pray, pray do. You will
      revive yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Never again, George; never again,&rdquo; said the dying woman. &ldquo;Let them lay
      me by my poor boy now, but promise me, that if ever you leave this
      dreadful place, and should grow rich, you will have us removed to some
      quiet country churchyard, a long, long way off&mdash;very far from here&mdash;where
      we can rest in peace. Dear George, promise me you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I do, I do,&rdquo; said the man, throwing himself passionately on his knees
      before her. &ldquo;Speak to me, Mary, another word; one look&mdash;but one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He ceased to speak: for the arm that clasped his neck grew stiff and
      heavy. A deep sigh escaped from the wasted form before him; the lips
      moved, and a smile played upon the face; but the lips were pallid, and the
      smile faded into a rigid and ghastly stare. He was alone in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That night, in the silence and desolation of his miserable room, the
      wretched man knelt down by the dead body of his wife, and called on God to
      witness a terrible oath, that from that hour, he devoted himself to
      revenge her death and that of his child; that thenceforth to the last
      moment of his life, his whole energies should be directed to this one
      object; that his revenge should be protracted and terrible; that his
      hatred should be undying and inextinguishable; and should hunt its object
      through the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The deepest despair, and passion scarcely human, had made such fierce
      ravages on his face and form, in that one night, that his companions in
      misfortune shrank affrighted from him as he passed by. His eyes were
      bloodshot and heavy, his face a deadly white, and his body bent as if with
      age. He had bitten his under lip nearly through in the violence of his
      mental suffering, and the blood which had flowed from the wound had
      trickled down his chin, and stained his shirt and neckerchief. No tear, or
      sound of complaint escaped him; but the unsettled look, and disordered
      haste with which he paced up and down the yard, denoted the fever which
      was burning within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was necessary that his wife&rsquo;s body should be removed from the prison,
      without delay. He received the communication with perfect calmness, and
      acquiesced in its propriety. Nearly all the inmates of the prison had
      assembled to witness its removal; they fell back on either side when the
      widower appeared; he walked hurriedly forward, and stationed himself,
      alone, in a little railed area close to the lodge gate, from whence the
      crowd, with an instinctive feeling of delicacy, had retired. The rude
      coffin was borne slowly forward on men&rsquo;s shoulders. A dead silence
      pervaded the throng, broken only by the audible lamentations of the women,
      and the shuffling steps of the bearers on the stone pavement. They reached
      the spot where the bereaved husband stood: and stopped. He laid his hand
      upon the coffin, and mechanically adjusting the pall with which it was
      covered, motioned them onward. The turnkeys in the prison lobby took off
      their hats as it passed through, and in another moment the heavy gate
      closed behind it. He looked vacantly upon the crowd, and fell heavily to
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Although for many weeks after this, he was watched, night and day, in the
      wildest ravings of fever, neither the consciousness of his loss, nor the
      recollection of the vow he had made, ever left him for a moment. Scenes
      changed before his eyes, place succeeded place, and event followed event,
      in all the hurry of delirium; but they were all connected in some way with
      the great object of his mind. He was sailing over a boundless expanse of
      sea, with a blood-red sky above, and the angry waters, lashed into fury
      beneath, boiling and eddying up, on every side. There was another vessel
      before them, toiling and labouring in the howling storm; her canvas
      fluttering in ribbons from the mast, and her deck thronged with figures
      who were lashed to the sides, over which huge waves every instant burst,
      sweeping away some devoted creatures into the foaming sea. Onward they
      bore, amidst the roaring mass of water, with a speed and force which
      nothing could resist; and striking the stem of the foremost vessel,
      crushed her beneath their keel. From the huge whirlpool which the sinking
      wreck occasioned, arose a shriek so loud and shrill&mdash;the death-cry of
      a hundred drowning creatures, blended into one fierce yell&mdash;that it
      rung far above the war-cry of the elements, and echoed, and re-echoed till
      it seemed to pierce air, sky, and ocean. But what was that&mdash;that old
      gray head that rose above the water&rsquo;s surface, and with looks of agony,
      and screams for aid, buffeted with the waves! One look, and he had sprung
      from the vessel&rsquo;s side, and with vigorous strokes was swimming towards it.
      He reached it; he was close upon it. They were <i>his </i>features. The
      old man saw him coming, and vainly strove to elude his grasp. But he
      clasped him tight, and dragged him beneath the water. Down, down with him,
      fifty fathoms down; his struggles grew fainter and fainter, until they
      wholly ceased. He was dead; he had killed him, and had kept his oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was traversing the scorching sands of a mighty desert, barefoot and
      alone. The sand choked and blinded him; its fine thin grains entered the
      very pores of his skin, and irritated him almost to madness. Gigantic
      masses of the same material, carried forward by the wind, and shone
      through by the burning sun, stalked in the distance like pillars of living
      fire. The bones of men, who had perished in the dreary waste, lay
      scattered at his feet; a fearful light fell on everything around; so far
      as the eye could reach, nothing but objects of dread and horror presented
      themselves. Vainly striving to utter a cry of terror, with his tongue
      cleaving to his mouth, he rushed madly forward. Armed with supernatural
      strength, he waded through the sand, until, exhausted with fatigue and
      thirst, he fell senseless on the earth. What fragrant coolness revived
      him; what gushing sound was that? Water! It was indeed a well; and the
      clear fresh stream was running at his feet. He drank deeply of it, and
      throwing his aching limbs upon the bank, sank into a delicious trance. The
      sound of approaching footsteps roused him. An old gray-headed man tottered
      forward to slake his burning thirst. It was <i>he</i> again! He wound his
      arms round the old man&rsquo;s body, and held him back. He struggled, and
      shrieked for water&mdash;for but one drop of water to save his life! But
      he held the old man firmly, and watched his agonies with greedy eyes; and
      when his lifeless head fell forward on his bosom, he rolled the corpse
      from him with his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When the fever left him, and consciousness returned, he awoke to find
      himself rich and free, to hear that the parent who would have let him die
      in jail&mdash;<i>would</i>! who <i>had </i>let those who were far dearer
      to him than his own existence die of want, and sickness of heart that
      medicine cannot cure&mdash;had been found dead in his bed of down. He had
      had all the heart to leave his son a beggar, but proud even of his health
      and strength, had put off the act till it was too late, and now might
      gnash his teeth in the other world, at the thought of the wealth his
      remissness had left him. He awoke to this, and he awoke to more. To
      recollect the purpose for which he lived, and to remember that his enemy
      was his wife&rsquo;s own father&mdash;the man who had cast him into prison, and
      who, when his daughter and her child sued at his feet for mercy, had
      spurned them from his door. Oh, how he cursed the weakness that prevented
      him from being up, and active, in his scheme of vengeance!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He caused himself to be carried from the scene of his loss and misery,
      and conveyed to a quiet residence on the sea-coast; not in the hope of
      recovering his peace of mind or happiness, for both were fled for ever;
      but to restore his prostrate energies, and meditate on his darling object.
      And here, some evil spirit cast in his way the opportunity for his first,
      most horrible revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was summer-time; and wrapped in his gloomy thoughts, he would issue
      from his solitary lodgings early in the evening, and wandering along a
      narrow path beneath the cliffs, to a wild and lonely spot that had struck
      his fancy in his ramblings, seat himself on some fallen fragment of the
      rock, and burying his face in his hands, remain there for hours&mdash;sometimes
      until night had completely closed in, and the long shadows of the frowning
      cliffs above his head cast a thick, black darkness on every object near
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was seated here, one calm evening, in his old position, now and then
      raising his head to watch the flight of a sea-gull, or carry his eye along
      the glorious crimson path, which, commencing in the middle of the ocean,
      seemed to lead to its very verge where the sun was setting, when the
      profound stillness of the spot was broken by a loud cry for help; he
      listened, doubtful of his having heard aright, when the cry was repeated
      with even greater vehemence than before, and, starting to his feet, he
      hastened in the direction whence it proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The tale told itself at once: some scattered garments lay on the beach; a
      human head was just visible above the waves at a little distance from the
      shore; and an old man, wringing his hands in agony, was running to and
      fro, shrieking for assistance. The invalid, whose strength was now
      sufficiently restored, threw off his coat, and rushed towards the sea,
      with the intention of plunging in, and dragging the drowning man ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Hasten here, Sir, in God&rsquo;s name; help, help, sir, for the love of
      Heaven. He is my son, Sir, my only son!&rdquo; said the old man frantically, as
      he advanced to meet him. &ldquo;My only son, Sir, and he is dying before his
      father&rsquo;s eyes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the first word the old man uttered, the stranger checked himself in
      his career, and, folding his arms, stood perfectly motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man, recoiling, &ldquo;Heyling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The stranger smiled, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Heyling!&rdquo; said the old man wildly; &ldquo;my boy, Heyling, my dear boy, look,
      look!&rdquo; Gasping for breath, the miserable father pointed to the spot where
      the young man was struggling for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;He cries once more. He is alive yet. Heyling,
      save him, save him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The stranger smiled again, and remained immovable as a statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I have wronged you,&rdquo; shrieked the old man, falling on his knees, and
      clasping his hands together. &ldquo;Be revenged; take my all, my life; cast me
      into the water at your feet, and, if human nature can repress a struggle,
      I will die, without stirring hand or foot. Do it, Heyling, do it, but save
      my boy; he is so young, Heyling, so young to die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the stranger, grasping the old man fiercely by the wrist;
      &ldquo;I will have life for life, and here is <i>one</i>. <i>My</i> child died,
      before his father&rsquo;s eyes, a far more agonising and painful death than that
      young slanderer of his sister&rsquo;s worth is meeting while I speak. You
      laughed&mdash;laughed in your daughter&rsquo;s face, where death had already set
      his hand&mdash;at our sufferings, then. What think you of them now! See
      there, see there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As the stranger spoke, he pointed to the sea. A faint cry died away upon
      its surface; the last powerful struggle of the dying man agitated the
      rippling waves for a few seconds; and the spot where he had gone down into
      his early grave, was undistinguishable from the surrounding water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three years had elapsed, when a gentleman alighted from a private
      carriage at the door of a London attorney, then well known as a man of no
      great nicety in his professional dealings, and requested a private
      interview on business of importance. Although evidently not past the prime
      of life, his face was pale, haggard, and dejected; and it did not require
      the acute perception of the man of business, to discern at a glance, that
      disease or suffering had done more to work a change in his appearance,
      than the mere hand of time could have accomplished in twice the period of
      his whole life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I wish you to undertake some legal business for me,&rdquo; said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The attorney bowed obsequiously, and glanced at a large packet which the
      gentleman carried in his hand. His visitor observed the look, and
      proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;It is no common business,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;nor have these papers reached my
      hands without long trouble and great expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The attorney cast a still more anxious look at the packet; and his
      visitor, untying the string that bound it, disclosed a quantity of
      promissory notes, with copies of deeds, and other documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Upon these papers,&rdquo; said the client, &ldquo;the man whose name they bear, has
      raised, as you will see, large sums of money, for years past. There was a
      tacit understanding between him and the men into whose hands they
      originally went&mdash;and from whom I have by degrees purchased the whole,
      for treble and quadruple their nominal value&mdash;that these loans should
      be from time to time renewed, until a given period had elapsed. Such an
      understanding is nowhere expressed. He has sustained many losses of late;
      and these obligations accumulating upon him at once, would crush him to
      the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;The whole amount is many thousands of pounds,&rdquo; said the attorney,
      looking over the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said the client.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo; inquired the man of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Do!&rdquo; replied the client, with sudden vehemence. &ldquo;Put every engine of the
      law in force, every trick that ingenuity can devise and rascality execute;
      fair means and foul; the open oppression of the law, aided by all the
      craft of its most ingenious practitioners. I would have him die a
      harassing and lingering death. Ruin him, seize and sell his lands and
      goods, drive him from house and home, and drag him forth a beggar in his
      old age, to die in a common jail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;But the costs, my dear Sir, the costs of all this,&rdquo; reasoned the
      attorney, when he had recovered from his momentary surprise. &ldquo;If the
      defendant be a man of straw, who is to pay the costs, Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Name any sum,&rdquo; said the stranger, his hand trembling so violently with
      excitement, that he could scarcely hold the pen he seized as he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;any
      sum, and it is yours. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to name it, man. I shall not think
      it dear, if you gain my object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The attorney named a large sum, at hazard, as the advance he should
      require to secure himself against the possibility of loss; but more with
      the view of ascertaining how far his client was really disposed to go,
      than with any idea that he would comply with the demand. The stranger
      wrote a cheque upon his banker, for the whole amount, and left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The draft was duly honoured, and the attorney, finding that his strange
      client might be safely relied upon, commenced his work in earnest. For
      more than two years afterwards, Mr. Heyling would sit whole days together,
      in the office, poring over the papers as they accumulated, and reading
      again and again, his eyes gleaming with joy, the letters of remonstrance,
      the prayers for a little delay, the representations of the certain ruin in
      which the opposite party must be involved, which poured in, as suit after
      suit, and process after process, was commenced. To all applications for a
      brief indulgence, there was but one reply&mdash;the money must be paid.
      Land, house, furniture, each in its turn, was taken under some one of the
      numerous executions which were issued; and the old man himself would have
      been immured in prison had he not escaped the vigilance of the officers,
      and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The implacable animosity of Heyling, so far from being satiated by the
      success of his persecution, increased a hundredfold with the ruin he
      inflicted. On being informed of the old man&rsquo;s flight, his fury was
      unbounded. He gnashed his teeth with rage, tore the hair from his head,
      and assailed with horrid imprecations the men who had been intrusted with
      the writ. He was only restored to comparative calmness by repeated
      assurances of the certainty of discovering the fugitive. Agents were sent
      in quest of him, in all directions; every stratagem that could be invented
      was resorted to, for the purpose of discovering his place of retreat; but
      it was all in vain. Half a year had passed over, and he was still
      undiscovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At length late one night, Heyling, of whom nothing had been seen for many
      weeks before, appeared at his attorney&rsquo;s private residence, and sent up
      word that a gentleman wished to see him instantly. Before the attorney,
      who had recognised his voice from above stairs, could order the servant to
      admit him, he had rushed up the staircase, and entered the drawing-room
      pale and breathless. Having closed the door, to prevent being overheard,
      he sank into a chair, and said, in a low voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Hush! I have found him at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said the attorney. &ldquo;Well done, my dear sir, well done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;He lies concealed in a wretched lodging in Camden Town,&rdquo; said Heyling.
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is as well we <i>did </i>lose sight of him, for he has been
      living alone there, in the most abject misery, all the time, and he is
      poor&mdash;very poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the attorney. &ldquo;You will have the caption made
      to-morrow, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Heyling. &ldquo;Stay! No! The next day. You are surprised at my
      wishing to postpone it,&rdquo; he added, with a ghastly smile; &ldquo;but I had
      forgotten. The next day is an anniversary in his life: let it be done
      then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the attorney. &ldquo;Will you write down instructions for the
      officer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;No; let him meet me here, at eight in the evening, and I will accompany
      him myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They met on the appointed night, and, hiring a hackney-coach, directed
      the driver to stop at that corner of the old Pancras Road, at which stands
      the parish workhouse. By the time they alighted there, it was quite dark;
      and, proceeding by the dead wall in front of the Veterinary Hospital, they
      entered a small by-street, which is, or was at that time, called Little
      College Street, and which, whatever it may be now, was in those days a
      desolate place enough, surrounded by little else than fields and ditches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Having drawn the travelling-cap he had on half over his face, and muffled
      himself in his cloak, Heyling stopped before the meanest-looking house in
      the street, and knocked gently at the door. It was at once opened by a
      woman, who dropped a curtsey of recognition, and Heyling, whispering the
      officer to remain below, crept gently upstairs, and, opening the door of
      the front room, entered at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The object of his search and his unrelenting animosity, now a decrepit
      old man, was seated at a bare deal table, on which stood a miserable
      candle. He started on the entrance of the stranger, and rose feebly to his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What now, what now?&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;What fresh misery is this? What
      do you want here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;A word with <i>you</i>,&rdquo; replied Heyling. As he spoke, he seated himself
      at the other end of the table, and, throwing off his cloak and cap,
      disclosed his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old man seemed instantly deprived of speech. He fell backward in his
      chair, and, clasping his hands together, gazed on the apparition with a
      mingled look of abhorrence and fear.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0414.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;This day six years,&rdquo; said Heyling, &ldquo;I claimed the life you owed me for
      my child&rsquo;s. Beside the lifeless form of your daughter, old man, I swore to
      live a life of revenge. I have never swerved from my purpose for a
      moment&rsquo;s space; but if I had, one thought of her uncomplaining, suffering
      look, as she drooped away, or of the starving face of our innocent child,
      would have nerved me to my task. My first act of requital you well
      remember: this is my last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old man shivered, and his hands dropped powerless by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I leave England to-morrow,&rdquo; said Heyling, after a moment&rsquo;s pause.
      &ldquo;To-night I consign you to the living death to which you devoted her&mdash;a
      hopeless prison&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He raised his eyes to the old man&rsquo;s countenance, and paused. He lifted
      the light to his face, set it gently down, and left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You had better see to the old man,&rdquo; he said to the woman, as he opened
      the door, and motioned the officer to follow him into the street. &ldquo;I think
      he is ill.&rdquo; The woman closed the door, ran hastily upstairs, and found him
      lifeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beneath a plain gravestone, in one of the most peaceful and secluded
      churchyards in Kent, where wild flowers mingle with the grass, and the
      soft landscape around forms the fairest spot in the garden of England, lie
      the bones of the young mother and her gentle child. But the ashes of the
      father do not mingle with theirs; nor, from that night forward, did the
      attorney ever gain the remotest clue to the subsequent history of his
      queer client.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As the old man concluded his tale, he advanced to a peg in one corner, and
      taking down his hat and coat, put them on with great deliberation; and,
      without saying another word, walked slowly away. As the gentleman with the
      Mosaic studs had fallen asleep, and the major part of the company were
      deeply occupied in the humorous process of dropping melted tallow-grease
      into his brandy-and-water, Mr. Pickwick departed unnoticed, and having
      settled his own score, and that of Mr. Weller, issued forth, in company
      with that gentleman, from beneath the portal of the Magpie and Stump.

      CHAPTER XXII. MR. PICKWICK JOURNEYS TO IPSWICH AND MEETS WITH A ROMANTIC
      ADVENTURE WITH A MIDDLE-AGED LADY IN YELLOW CURL-PAPERS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat &lsquo;ere your
      governor&rsquo;s luggage, Sammy?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller of his affectionate son,
      as he entered the yard of the Bull Inn, Whitechapel, with a travelling-bag
      and a small portmanteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You might ha&rsquo; made a worser guess than that, old feller,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Weller the younger, setting down his burden in the yard, and sitting
      himself down upon it afterwards. &lsquo;The governor hisself&rsquo;ll be down here
      presently.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a-cabbin&rsquo; it, I suppose?&rsquo; said the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s a havin&rsquo; two mile o&rsquo; danger at eight-pence,&rsquo; responded the son.
      &lsquo;How&rsquo;s mother-in-law this mornin&rsquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Queer, Sammy, queer,&rsquo; replied the elder Mr. Weller, with impressive
      gravity. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s been gettin&rsquo; rayther in the Methodistical order lately,
      Sammy; and she is uncommon pious, to be sure. She&rsquo;s too good a creetur for
      me, Sammy. I feel I don&rsquo;t deserve her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Mr. Samuel. &lsquo;that&rsquo;s wery self-denyin&rsquo; o&rsquo; you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery,&rsquo; replied his parent, with a sigh. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s got hold o&rsquo; some inwention
      for grown-up people being born again, Sammy&mdash;the new birth, I think
      they calls it. I should wery much like to see that system in haction,
      Sammy. I should wery much like to see your mother-in-law born again.
      Wouldn&rsquo;t I put her out to nurse!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think them women does t&rsquo;other day,&rsquo; continued Mr. Weller,
      after a short pause, during which he had significantly struck the side of
      his nose with his forefinger some half-dozen times. &lsquo;What do you think
      they does, t&rsquo;other day, Sammy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; replied Sam, &lsquo;what?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goes and gets up a grand tea drinkin&rsquo; for a feller they calls their
      shepherd,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller. &lsquo;I was a-standing starin&rsquo; in at the pictur
      shop down at our place, when I sees a little bill about it; &ldquo;tickets
      half-a-crown. All applications to be made to the committee. Secretary,
      Mrs. Weller&rdquo;; and when I got home there was the committee a-sittin&rsquo; in our
      back parlour. Fourteen women; I wish you could ha&rsquo; heard &lsquo;em, Sammy. There
      they was, a-passin&rsquo; resolutions, and wotin&rsquo; supplies, and all sorts o&rsquo; 
      games. Well, what with your mother-in-law a-worrying me to go, and what
      with my looking for&rsquo;ard to seein&rsquo; some queer starts if I did, I put my
      name down for a ticket; at six o&rsquo;clock on the Friday evenin&rsquo; I dresses
      myself out wery smart, and off I goes with the old &lsquo;ooman, and up we walks
      into a fust-floor where there was tea-things for thirty, and a whole lot
      o&rsquo; women as begins whisperin&rsquo; to one another, and lookin&rsquo; at me, as if
      they&rsquo;d never seen a rayther stout gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n of eight-and-fifty afore. By
      and by, there comes a great bustle downstairs, and a lanky chap with a red
      nose and a white neckcloth rushes up, and sings out, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the shepherd
      a-coming to wisit his faithful flock;&rdquo; and in comes a fat chap in black,
      vith a great white face, a-smilin&rsquo; avay like clockwork. Such goin&rsquo;s on,
      Sammy! &ldquo;The kiss of peace,&rdquo; says the shepherd; and then he kissed the
      women all round, and ven he&rsquo;d done, the man vith the red nose began. I was
      just a-thinkin&rsquo; whether I hadn&rsquo;t better begin too&mdash;&lsquo;specially as
      there was a wery nice lady a-sittin&rsquo; next me&mdash;ven in comes the tea,
      and your mother-in-law, as had been makin&rsquo; the kettle bile downstairs. At
      it they went, tooth and nail. Such a precious loud hymn, Sammy, while the
      tea was a brewing; such a grace, such eatin&rsquo; and drinkin&rsquo;! I wish you
      could ha&rsquo; seen the shepherd walkin&rsquo; into the ham and muffins. I never see
      such a chap to eat and drink&mdash;never. The red-nosed man warn&rsquo;t by no
      means the sort of person you&rsquo;d like to grub by contract, but he was
      nothin&rsquo; to the shepherd. Well; arter the tea was over, they sang another
      hymn, and then the shepherd began to preach: and wery well he did it,
      considerin&rsquo; how heavy them muffins must have lied on his chest. Presently
      he pulls up, all of a sudden, and hollers out, &ldquo;Where is the sinner; where
      is the mis&rsquo;rable sinner?&rdquo; Upon which, all the women looked at me, and
      began to groan as if they was a-dying. I thought it was rather sing&rsquo;ler,
      but howsoever, I says nothing. Presently he pulls up again, and lookin&rsquo; 
      wery hard at me, says, &ldquo;Where is the sinner; where is the mis&rsquo;rable
      sinner?&rdquo; and all the women groans again, ten times louder than afore. I
      got rather savage at this, so I takes a step or two for&rsquo;ard and says, &ldquo;My
      friend,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;did you apply that &lsquo;ere obserwation to me?&rdquo; &lsquo;Stead of
      beggin&rsquo; my pardon as any gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n would ha&rsquo; done, he got more abusive
      than ever:&mdash;called me a wessel, Sammy&mdash;a wessel of wrath&mdash;and
      all sorts o&rsquo; names. So my blood being reg&rsquo;larly up, I first gave him two
      or three for himself, and then two or three more to hand over to the man
      with the red nose, and walked off. I wish you could ha&rsquo; heard how the
      women screamed, Sammy, ven they picked up the shepherd from underneath the
      table&mdash;Hollo! here&rsquo;s the governor, the size of life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Weller spoke, Mr. Pickwick dismounted from a cab, and entered the
      yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fine mornin&rsquo;, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, senior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beautiful indeed,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beautiful indeed,&rsquo; echoes a red-haired man with an inquisitive nose and
      green spectacles, who had unpacked himself from a cab at the same moment
      as Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Going to Ipswich, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Extraordinary coincidence. So am I.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going outside?&rsquo; said the red-haired man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick bowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless my soul, how remarkable&mdash;I am going outside, too,&rsquo; said the
      red-haired man; &lsquo;we are positively going together.&rsquo; And the red-haired
      man, who was an important-looking, sharp-nosed, mysterious-spoken
      personage, with a bird-like habit of giving his head a jerk every time he
      said anything, smiled as if he had made one of the strangest discoveries
      that ever fell to the lot of human wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am happy in the prospect of your company, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the new-comer, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a good thing for both of us, isn&rsquo;t it?
      Company, you see&mdash;company&mdash;is&mdash;is&mdash;it&rsquo;s a very
      different thing from solitude&mdash;ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no denying that &lsquo;ere,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, joining in the
      conversation, with an affable smile. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I call a self-evident
      proposition, as the dog&rsquo;s-meat man said, when the housemaid told him he
      warn&rsquo;t a gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the red-haired man, surveying Mr. Weller from head to foot with
      a supercilious look. &lsquo;Friend of yours, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not exactly a friend,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, in a low tone. &lsquo;The fact is,
      he is my servant, but I allow him to take a good many liberties; for,
      between ourselves, I flatter myself he is an original, and I am rather
      proud of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the red-haired man, &lsquo;that, you see, is a matter of taste. I am
      not fond of anything original; I don&rsquo;t like it; don&rsquo;t see the necessity
      for it. What&rsquo;s your name, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here is my card, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, much amused by the
      abruptness of the question, and the singular manner of the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the red-haired man, placing the card in his pocket-book,
      &lsquo;Pickwick; very good. I like to know a man&rsquo;s name, it saves so much
      trouble. That&rsquo;s my card, sir. Magnus, you will perceive, sir&mdash;Magnus
      is my name. It&rsquo;s rather a good name, I think, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A very good name, indeed,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, wholly unable to repress a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I think it is,&rsquo; resumed Mr. Magnus. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a good name before it,
      too, you will observe. Permit me, sir&mdash;if you hold the card a little
      slanting, this way, you catch the light upon the up-stroke. There&mdash;Peter
      Magnus&mdash;sounds well, I think, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Curious circumstance about those initials, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus. &lsquo;You
      will observe&mdash;P.M.&mdash;post meridian. In hasty notes to intimate
      acquaintance, I sometimes sign myself &ldquo;Afternoon.&rdquo; It amuses my friends
      very much, Mr. Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is calculated to afford them the highest gratification, I should
      conceive,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, rather envying the ease with which Mr.
      Magnus&rsquo;s friends were entertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n,&rsquo; said the hostler, &lsquo;coach is ready, if you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is all my luggage in?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Magnus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is the red bag in?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the striped bag?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fore boot, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the brown-paper parcel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Under the seat, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the leather hat-box?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re all in, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, will you get up?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excuse me,&rsquo; replied Magnus, standing on the wheel. &lsquo;Excuse me, Mr.
      Pickwick. I cannot consent to get up, in this state of uncertainty. I am
      quite satisfied from that man&rsquo;s manner, that the leather hat-box is not
      in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The solemn protestations of the hostler being wholly unavailing, the
      leather hat-box was obliged to be raked up from the lowest depth of the
      boot, to satisfy him that it had been safely packed; and after he had been
      assured on this head, he felt a solemn presentiment, first, that the red
      bag was mislaid, and next that the striped bag had been stolen, and then
      that the brown-paper parcel &lsquo;had come untied.&rsquo; At length when he had
      received ocular demonstration of the groundless nature of each and every
      of these suspicions, he consented to climb up to the roof of the coach,
      observing that now he had taken everything off his mind, he felt quite
      comfortable and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re given to nervousness, ain&rsquo;t you, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller,
      senior, eyeing the stranger askance, as he mounted to his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; I always am rather about these little matters,&rsquo; said the stranger,
      &lsquo;but I am all right now&mdash;quite right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a blessin&rsquo;, said Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Sammy, help your master up to
      the box; t&rsquo;other leg, Sir, that&rsquo;s it; give us your hand, Sir. Up with you.
      You was a lighter weight when you was a boy, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      True enough, that, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said the breathless Mr. Pickwick
      good-humouredly, as he took his seat on the box beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jump up in front, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Now Villam, run &lsquo;em out. Take
      care o&rsquo; the archvay, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n. &ldquo;Heads,&rdquo; as the pieman says. That&rsquo;ll do,
      Villam. Let &lsquo;em alone.&rsquo; And away went the coach up Whitechapel, to the
      admiration of the whole population of that pretty densely populated
      quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a wery nice neighbourhood, this, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam, with a touch of the
      hat, which always preceded his entering into conversation with his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not indeed, Sam,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, surveying the crowded and
      filthy street through which they were passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a wery remarkable circumstance, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;that poverty and
      oysters always seem to go together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What I mean, sir,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;is, that the poorer a place is, the greater
      call there seems to be for oysters. Look here, sir; here&rsquo;s a oyster-stall
      to every half-dozen houses. The street&rsquo;s lined vith &lsquo;em. Blessed if I
      don&rsquo;t think that ven a man&rsquo;s wery poor, he rushes out of his lodgings, and
      eats oysters in reg&rsquo;lar desperation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure he does,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, senior; &lsquo;and it&rsquo;s just the same
      vith pickled salmon!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those are two very remarkable facts, which never occurred to me before,&rsquo; 
      said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;The very first place we stop at, I&rsquo;ll make a note of
      them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had reached the turnpike at Mile End; a profound silence
      prevailed until they had got two or three miles farther on, when Mr.
      Weller, senior, turning suddenly to Mr. Pickwick, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery queer life is a pike-keeper&rsquo;s, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A what?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pike-keeper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by a pike-keeper?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Peter Magnus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old &lsquo;un means a turnpike-keeper, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n,&rsquo; observed Mr. Samuel
      Weller, in explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I see. Yes; very curious life. Very
      uncomfortable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re all on &lsquo;em men as has met vith some disappointment in life,&rsquo; said
      Mr. Weller, senior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, ay,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Consequence of vich, they retires from the world, and shuts
      themselves up in pikes; partly with the view of being solitary, and partly
      to rewenge themselves on mankind by takin&rsquo; tolls.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I never knew that before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fact, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller; &lsquo;if they was gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, you&rsquo;d call &lsquo;em
      misanthropes, but as it is, they only takes to pike-keepin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With such conversation, possessing the inestimable charm of blending
      amusement with instruction, did Mr. Weller beguile the tediousness of the
      journey, during the greater part of the day. Topics of conversation were
      never wanting, for even when any pause occurred in Mr. Weller&rsquo;s loquacity,
      it was abundantly supplied by the desire evinced by Mr. Magnus to make
      himself acquainted with the whole of the personal history of his
      fellow-travellers, and his loudly-expressed anxiety at every stage,
      respecting the safety and well-being of the two bags, the leather hat-box,
      and the brown-paper parcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the main street of Ipswich, on the left-hand side of the way, a short
      distance after you have passed through the open space fronting the Town
      Hall, stands an inn known far and wide by the appellation of the Great
      White Horse, rendered the more conspicuous by a stone statue of some
      rampacious animal with flowing mane and tail, distantly resembling an
      insane cart-horse, which is elevated above the principal door. The Great
      White Horse is famous in the neighbourhood, in the same degree as a prize
      ox, or a county-paper-chronicled turnip, or unwieldy pig&mdash;for its
      enormous size. Never was such labyrinths of uncarpeted passages, such
      clusters of mouldy, ill-lighted rooms, such huge numbers of small dens for
      eating or sleeping in, beneath any one roof, as are collected together
      between the four walls of the Great White Horse at Ipswich.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the door of this overgrown tavern that the London coach stopped,
      at the same hour every evening; and it was from this same London coach
      that Mr. Pickwick, Sam Weller, and Mr. Peter Magnus dismounted, on the
      particular evening to which this chapter of our history bears reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you stop here, sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Peter Magnus, when the striped bag,
      and the red bag, and the brown-paper parcel, and the leather hat-box, had
      all been deposited in the passage. &lsquo;Do you stop here, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus, &lsquo;I never knew anything like these
      extraordinary coincidences. Why, I stop here too. I hope we dine
      together?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With pleasure,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;I am not quite certain whether I
      have any friends here or not, though. Is there any gentleman of the name
      of Tupman here, waiter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A corpulent man, with a fortnight&rsquo;s napkin under his arm, and coeval
      stockings on his legs, slowly desisted from his occupation of staring down
      the street, on this question being put to him by Mr. Pickwick; and, after
      minutely inspecting that gentleman&rsquo;s appearance, from the crown of his hat
      to the lowest button of his gaiters, replied emphatically&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor any gentleman of the name of Snodgrass?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor Winkle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friends have not arrived to-day, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;We will
      dine alone, then. Show us a private room, waiter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On this request being preferred, the corpulent man condescended to order
      the boots to bring in the gentlemen&rsquo;s luggage; and preceding them down a
      long, dark passage, ushered them into a large, badly-furnished apartment,
      with a dirty grate, in which a small fire was making a wretched attempt to
      be cheerful, but was fast sinking beneath the dispiriting influence of the
      place. After the lapse of an hour, a bit of fish and a steak was served up
      to the travellers, and when the dinner was cleared away, Mr. Pickwick and
      Mr. Peter Magnus drew their chairs up to the fire, and having ordered a
      bottle of the worst possible port wine, at the highest possible price, for
      the good of the house, drank brandy-and-water for their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Peter Magnus was naturally of a very communicative disposition, and
      the brandy-and-water operated with wonderful effect in warming into life
      the deepest hidden secrets of his bosom. After sundry accounts of himself,
      his family, his connections, his friends, his jokes, his business, and his
      brothers (most talkative men have a great deal to say about their
      brothers), Mr. Peter Magnus took a view of Mr. Pickwick through his
      coloured spectacles for several minutes, and then said, with an air of
      modesty&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what do you think&mdash;what <i>do</i> you think, Mr. Pickwick&mdash;I
      have come down here for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;it is wholly impossible for me to
      guess; on business, perhaps.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Partly right, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Peter Magnus, &lsquo;but partly wrong at the
      same time; try again, Mr. Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I must throw myself on your mercy, to tell
      me or not, as you may think best; for I should never guess, if I were to
      try all night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then, he-he-he!&rsquo; said Mr. Peter Magnus, with a bashful titter, &lsquo;what
      should you think, Mr. Pickwick, if I had come down here to make a
      proposal, Sir, eh? He, he, he!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think! That you are very likely to succeed,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, with
      one of his beaming smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus. &lsquo;But do you really think so, Mr. Pickwick? Do you,
      though?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; but you&rsquo;re joking, though.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not, indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then,&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus, &lsquo;to let you into a little secret, I think so
      too. I don&rsquo;t mind telling you, Mr. Pickwick, although I&rsquo;m dreadful jealous
      by nature&mdash;horrid&mdash;that the lady is in this house.&rsquo; Here Mr.
      Magnus took off his spectacles, on purpose to wink, and then put them on
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what you were running out of the room for, before dinner, then, so
      often,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! Yes, you&rsquo;re right, that was it; not such a fool as to see her,
      though.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; wouldn&rsquo;t do, you know, after having just come off a journey. Wait
      till to-morrow, sir; double the chance then. Mr. Pickwick, Sir, there is a
      suit of clothes in that bag, and a hat in that box, which, I expect, in
      the effect they will produce, will be invaluable to me, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; you must have observed my anxiety about them to-day. I do not
      believe that such another suit of clothes, and such a hat, could be bought
      for money, Mr. Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick congratulated the fortunate owner of the irresistible
      garments on their acquisition; and Mr. Peter Magnus remained a few moments
      apparently absorbed in contemplation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a fine creature,&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very,&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus. &lsquo;Very. She lives about twenty miles from here,
      Mr. Pickwick. I heard she would be here to-night and all to-morrow
      forenoon, and came down to seize the opportunity. I think an inn is a good
      sort of a place to propose to a single woman in, Mr. Pickwick. She is more
      likely to feel the loneliness of her situation in travelling, perhaps,
      than she would be at home. What do you think, Mr. Pickwick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it is very probable,&rsquo; replied that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Mr. Peter Magnus, &lsquo;but I am
      naturally rather curious; what may you have come down here for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On a far less pleasant errand, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, the colour
      mounting to his face at the recollection. &lsquo;I have come down here, Sir, to
      expose the treachery and falsehood of an individual, upon whose truth and
      honour I placed implicit reliance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said Mr. Peter Magnus, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s very unpleasant. It is a lady, I
      presume? Eh? ah! Sly, Mr. Pickwick, sly. Well, Mr. Pickwick, sir, I
      wouldn&rsquo;t probe your feelings for the world. Painful subjects, these, sir,
      very painful. Don&rsquo;t mind me, Mr. Pickwick, if you wish to give vent to
      your feelings. I know what it is to be jilted, Sir; I have endured that
      sort of thing three or four times.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am much obliged to you, for your condolence on what you presume to be
      my melancholy case,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, winding up his watch, and laying
      it on the table, &lsquo;but&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Mr. Peter Magnus, &lsquo;not a word more; it&rsquo;s a painful subject.
      I see, I see. What&rsquo;s the time, Mr. Pickwick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Past twelve.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, it&rsquo;s time to go to bed. It will never do, sitting here. I shall
      be pale to-morrow, Mr. Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the bare notion of such a calamity, Mr. Peter Magnus rang the bell for
      the chambermaid; and the striped bag, the red bag, the leathern hat-box,
      and the brown-paper parcel, having been conveyed to his bedroom, he
      retired in company with a japanned candlestick, to one side of the house,
      while Mr. Pickwick, and another japanned candlestick, were conducted
      through a multitude of tortuous windings, to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is your room, sir,&rsquo; said the chambermaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, looking round him. It was a tolerably
      large double-bedded room, with a fire; upon the whole, a more
      comfortable-looking apartment than Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s short experience of the
      accommodations of the Great White Horse had led him to expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody sleeps in the other bed, of course,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good. Tell my servant to bring me up some hot water at half-past
      eight in the morning, and that I shall not want him any more to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Sir,&rsquo; and bidding Mr. Pickwick good-night, the chambermaid retired,
      and left him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick sat himself down in a chair before the fire, and fell into a
      train of rambling meditations. First he thought of his friends, and
      wondered when they would join him; then his mind reverted to Mrs. Martha
      Bardell; and from that lady it wandered, by a natural process, to the
      dingy counting-house of Dodson &amp; Fogg. From Dodson &amp; Fogg&rsquo;s it
      flew off at a tangent, to the very centre of the history of the queer
      client; and then it came back to the Great White Horse at Ipswich, with
      sufficient clearness to convince Mr. Pickwick that he was falling asleep.
      So he roused himself, and began to undress, when he recollected he had
      left his watch on the table downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this watch was a special favourite with Mr. Pickwick, having been
      carried about, beneath the shadow of his waistcoat, for a greater number
      of years than we feel called upon to state at present. The possibility of
      going to sleep, unless it were ticking gently beneath his pillow, or in
      the watch-pocket over his head, had never entered Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s brain. So
      as it was pretty late now, and he was unwilling to ring his bell at that
      hour of the night, he slipped on his coat, of which he had just divested
      himself, and taking the japanned candlestick in his hand, walked quietly
      downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more stairs Mr. Pickwick went down, the more stairs there seemed to be
      to descend, and again and again, when Mr. Pickwick got into some narrow
      passage, and began to congratulate himself on having gained the
      ground-floor, did another flight of stairs appear before his astonished
      eyes. At last he reached a stone hall, which he remembered to have seen
      when he entered the house. Passage after passage did he explore; room
      after room did he peep into; at length, as he was on the point of giving
      up the search in despair, he opened the door of the identical room in
      which he had spent the evening, and beheld his missing property on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick seized the watch in triumph, and proceeded to retrace his
      steps to his bedchamber. If his progress downward had been attended with
      difficulties and uncertainty, his journey back was infinitely more
      perplexing. Rows of doors, garnished with boots of every shape, make, and
      size, branched off in every possible direction. A dozen times did he
      softly turn the handle of some bedroom door which resembled his own, when
      a gruff cry from within of &lsquo;Who the devil&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What do you want
      here?&rsquo; caused him to steal away, on tiptoe, with a perfectly marvellous
      celerity. He was reduced to the verge of despair, when an open door
      attracted his attention. He peeped in. Right at last! There were the two
      beds, whose situation he perfectly remembered, and the fire still burning.
      His candle, not a long one when he first received it, had flickered away
      in the drafts of air through which he had passed and sank into the socket
      as he closed the door after him. &lsquo;No matter,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I can
      undress myself just as well by the light of the fire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The bedsteads stood one on each side of the door; and on the inner side of
      each was a little path, terminating in a rush-bottomed chair, just wide
      enough to admit of a person&rsquo;s getting into or out of bed, on that side, if
      he or she thought proper. Having carefully drawn the curtains of his bed
      on the outside, Mr. Pickwick sat down on the rush-bottomed chair, and
      leisurely divested himself of his shoes and gaiters. He then took off and
      folded up his coat, waistcoat, and neckcloth, and slowly drawing on his
      tasselled nightcap, secured it firmly on his head, by tying beneath his
      chin the strings which he always had attached to that article of dress. It
      was at this moment that the absurdity of his recent bewilderment struck
      upon his mind. Throwing himself back in the rush-bottomed chair, Mr.
      Pickwick laughed to himself so heartily, that it would have been quite
      delightful to any man of well-constituted mind to have watched the smiles
      that expanded his amiable features as they shone forth from beneath the
      nightcap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the best idea,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick to himself, smiling till he
      almost cracked the nightcap strings&mdash;&lsquo;it is the best idea, my losing
      myself in this place, and wandering about these staircases, that I ever
      heard of. Droll, droll, very droll.&rsquo; Here Mr. Pickwick smiled again, a
      broader smile than before, and was about to continue the process of
      undressing, in the best possible humour, when he was suddenly stopped by a
      most unexpected interruption: to wit, the entrance into the room of some
      person with a candle, who, after locking the door, advanced to the
      dressing-table, and set down the light upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile that played on Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s features was instantaneously lost
      in a look of the most unbounded and wonder-stricken surprise. The person,
      whoever it was, had come in so suddenly and with so little noise, that Mr.
      Pickwick had had no time to call out, or oppose their entrance. Who could
      it be? A robber? Some evil-minded person who had seen him come upstairs
      with a handsome watch in his hand, perhaps. What was he to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      The only way in which Mr. Pickwick could catch a glimpse of his mysterious
      visitor with the least danger of being seen himself, was by creeping on to
      the bed, and peeping out from between the curtains on the opposite side.
      To this manoeuvre he accordingly resorted. Keeping the curtains carefully
      closed with his hand, so that nothing more of him could be seen than his
      face and nightcap, and putting on his spectacles, he mustered up courage
      and looked out.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/0432m.jpg" alt="0432m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0432.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick almost fainted with horror and dismay. Standing before the
      dressing-glass was a middle-aged lady, in yellow curl-papers, busily
      engaged in brushing what ladies call their &lsquo;back-hair.&rsquo; However the
      unconscious middle-aged lady came into that room, it was quite clear that
      she contemplated remaining there for the night; for she had brought a
      rushlight and shade with her, which, with praiseworthy precaution against
      fire, she had stationed in a basin on the floor, where it was glimmering
      away, like a gigantic lighthouse in a particularly small piece of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless my soul!&rsquo; thought Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;what a dreadful thing!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hem!&rsquo; said the lady; and in went Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s head with automaton-like
      rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never met with anything so awful as this,&rsquo; thought poor Mr. Pickwick,
      the cold perspiration starting in drops upon his nightcap. &lsquo;Never. This is
      fearful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite impossible to resist the urgent desire to see what was going
      forward. So out went Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s head again. The prospect was worse
      than before. The middle-aged lady had finished arranging her hair; had
      carefully enveloped it in a muslin nightcap with a small plaited border;
      and was gazing pensively on the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This matter is growing alarming,&rsquo; reasoned Mr. Pickwick with himself. &lsquo;I
      can&rsquo;t allow things to go on in this way. By the self-possession of that
      lady, it is clear to me that I must have come into the wrong room. If I
      call out she&rsquo;ll alarm the house; but if I remain here the consequences
      will be still more frightful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick, it is quite unnecessary to say, was one of the most modest
      and delicate-minded of mortals. The very idea of exhibiting his nightcap
      to a lady overpowered him, but he had tied those confounded strings in a
      knot, and, do what he would, he couldn&rsquo;t get it off. The disclosure must
      be made. There was only one other way of doing it. He shrunk behind the
      curtains, and called out very loudly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha-hum!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That the lady started at this unexpected sound was evident, by her falling
      up against the rushlight shade; that she persuaded herself it must have
      been the effect of imagination was equally clear, for when Mr. Pickwick,
      under the impression that she had fainted away stone-dead with fright,
      ventured to peep out again, she was gazing pensively on the fire as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most extraordinary female this,&rsquo; thought Mr. Pickwick, popping in again.
      &lsquo;Ha-hum!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These last sounds, so like those in which, as legends inform us, the
      ferocious giant Blunderbore was in the habit of expressing his opinion
      that it was time to lay the cloth, were too distinctly audible to be again
      mistaken for the workings of fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gracious Heaven!&rsquo; said the middle-aged lady, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;only a gentleman, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, from
      behind the curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A gentleman!&rsquo; said the lady, with a terrific scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all over!&rsquo; thought Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A strange man!&rsquo; shrieked the lady. Another instant and the house would be
      alarmed. Her garments rustled as she rushed towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, thrusting out his head in the extremity of his
      desperation, &lsquo;ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, although Mr. Pickwick was not actuated by any definite object in
      putting out his head, it was instantaneously productive of a good effect.
      The lady, as we have already stated, was near the door. She must pass it,
      to reach the staircase, and she would most undoubtedly have done so by
      this time, had not the sudden apparition of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s nightcap driven
      her back into the remotest corner of the apartment, where she stood
      staring wildly at Mr. Pickwick, while Mr. Pickwick in his turn stared
      wildly at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wretch,&rsquo; said the lady, covering her eyes with her hands, &lsquo;what do you
      want here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, ma&rsquo;am; nothing whatever, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing!&rsquo; said the lady, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, ma&rsquo;am, upon my honour,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, nodding his head so
      energetically, that the tassel of his nightcap danced again. &lsquo;I am almost
      ready to sink, ma&rsquo;am, beneath the confusion of addressing a lady in my
      nightcap (here the lady hastily snatched off hers), but I can&rsquo;t get it
      off, ma&rsquo;am (here Mr. Pickwick gave it a tremendous tug, in proof of the
      statement). It is evident to me, ma&rsquo;am, now, that I have mistaken this
      bedroom for my own. I had not been here five minutes, ma&rsquo;am, when you
      suddenly entered it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If this improbable story be really true, Sir,&rsquo; said the lady, sobbing
      violently, &lsquo;you will leave it instantly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will, ma&rsquo;am, with the greatest pleasure,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Instantly, sir,&rsquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Pickwick, very quickly. &lsquo;Certainly,
      ma&rsquo;am. I&mdash;I&mdash;am very sorry, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, making
      his appearance at the bottom of the bed, &lsquo;to have been the innocent
      occasion of this alarm and emotion; deeply sorry, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady pointed to the door. One excellent quality of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      character was beautifully displayed at this moment, under the most trying
      circumstances. Although he had hastily put on his hat over his nightcap,
      after the manner of the old patrol; although he carried his shoes and
      gaiters in his hand, and his coat and waistcoat over his arm; nothing
      could subdue his native politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am exceedingly sorry, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, bowing very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you are, Sir, you will at once leave the room,&rsquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Immediately, ma&rsquo;am; this instant, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, opening the
      door, and dropping both his shoes with a crash in so doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I trust, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; resumed Mr. Pickwick, gathering up his shoes, and
      turning round to bow again&mdash;&lsquo;I trust, ma&rsquo;am, that my unblemished
      character, and the devoted respect I entertain for your sex, will plead as
      some slight excuse for this&mdash;&rsquo; But before Mr. Pickwick could conclude
      the sentence, the lady had thrust him into the passage, and locked and
      bolted the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever grounds of self-congratulation Mr. Pickwick might have for having
      escaped so quietly from his late awkward situation, his present position
      was by no means enviable. He was alone, in an open passage, in a strange
      house in the middle of the night, half dressed; it was not to be supposed
      that he could find his way in perfect darkness to a room which he had been
      wholly unable to discover with a light, and if he made the slightest noise
      in his fruitless attempts to do so, he stood every chance of being shot
      at, and perhaps killed, by some wakeful traveller. He had no resource but
      to remain where he was until daylight appeared. So after groping his way a
      few paces down the passage, and, to his infinite alarm, stumbling over
      several pairs of boots in so doing, Mr. Pickwick crouched into a little
      recess in the wall, to wait for morning, as philosophically as he might.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not destined, however, to undergo this additional trial of
      patience; for he had not been long ensconced in his present concealment
      when, to his unspeakable horror, a man, bearing a light, appeared at the
      end of the passage. His horror was suddenly converted into joy, however,
      when he recognised the form of his faithful attendant. It was indeed Mr.
      Samuel Weller, who after sitting up thus late, in conversation with the
      boots, who was sitting up for the mail, was now about to retire to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, suddenly appearing before him, &lsquo;where&rsquo;s my
      bedroom?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller stared at his master with the most emphatic surprise; and it
      was not until the question had been repeated three several times, that he
      turned round, and led the way to the long-sought apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as he got into bed, &lsquo;I have made one of the most
      extraordinary mistakes to-night, that ever were heard of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery likely, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But of this I am determined, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;that if I were to
      stop in this house for six months, I would never trust myself about it,
      alone, again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the wery prudentest resolution as you could come to, Sir,&rsquo; replied
      Mr. Weller. &lsquo;You rayther want somebody to look arter you, Sir, when your
      judgment goes out a wisitin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by that, Sam?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. He raised himself in
      bed, and extended his hand, as if he were about to say something more; but
      suddenly checking himself, turned round, and bade his valet &lsquo;Good-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller. He paused when he got outside the
      door&mdash;shook his head&mdash;walked on&mdash;stopped&mdash;snuffed the
      candle&mdash;shook his head again&mdash;and finally proceeded slowly to
      his chamber, apparently buried in the profoundest meditation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. IN WHICH MR. SAMUEL WELLER BEGINS TO DEVOTE HIS ENERGIES TO
      THE RETURN MATCH BETWEEN HIMSELF AND MR. TROTTER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n a small room in
      the vicinity of the stableyard, betimes in the morning, which was ushered
      in by Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s adventure with the middle&mdash;aged lady in the
      yellow curl-papers, sat Mr. Weller, senior, preparing himself for his
      journey to London. He was sitting in an excellent attitude for having his
      portrait taken; and here it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very possible that at some earlier period of his career, Mr.
      Weller&rsquo;s profile might have presented a bold and determined outline. His
      face, however, had expanded under the influence of good living, and a
      disposition remarkable for resignation; and its bold, fleshy curves had so
      far extended beyond the limits originally assigned them, that unless you
      took a full view of his countenance in front, it was difficult to
      distinguish more than the extreme tip of a very rubicund nose. His chin,
      from the same cause, had acquired the grave and imposing form which is
      generally described by prefixing the word &lsquo;double&rsquo; to that expressive
      feature; and his complexion exhibited that peculiarly mottled combination
      of colours which is only to be seen in gentlemen of his profession, and in
      underdone roast beef. Round his neck he wore a crimson travelling-shawl,
      which merged into his chin by such imperceptible gradations, that it was
      difficult to distinguish the folds of the one, from the folds of the
      other. Over this, he mounted a long waistcoat of a broad pink-striped
      pattern, and over that again, a wide-skirted green coat, ornamented with
      large brass buttons, whereof the two which garnished the waist, were so
      far apart, that no man had ever beheld them both at the same time. His
      hair, which was short, sleek, and black, was just visible beneath the
      capacious brim of a low-crowned brown hat. His legs were encased in
      knee-cord breeches, and painted top-boots; and a copper watch-chain,
      terminating in one seal, and a key of the same material, dangled loosely
      from his capacious waistband.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have said that Mr. Weller was engaged in preparing for his journey to
      London&mdash;he was taking sustenance, in fact. On the table before him,
      stood a pot of ale, a cold round of beef, and a very respectable-looking
      loaf, to each of which he distributed his favours in turn, with the most
      rigid impartiality. He had just cut a mighty slice from the latter, when
      the footsteps of somebody entering the room, caused him to raise his head;
      and he beheld his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mornin&rsquo;, Sammy!&rsquo; said the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The son walked up to the pot of ale, and nodding significantly to his
      parent, took a long draught by way of reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good power o&rsquo; suction, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller the elder, looking
      into the pot, when his first-born had set it down half empty. &lsquo;You&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; 
      made an uncommon fine oyster, Sammy, if you&rsquo;d been born in that station o&rsquo; 
      life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I des-say, I should ha&rsquo; managed to pick up a respectable livin&rsquo;,&rsquo; 
      replied Sam applying himself to the cold beef, with considerable vigour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m wery sorry, Sammy,&rsquo; said the elder Mr. Weller, shaking up the ale, by
      describing small circles with the pot, preparatory to drinking. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m wery
      sorry, Sammy, to hear from your lips, as you let yourself be gammoned by
      that &lsquo;ere mulberry man. I always thought, up to three days ago, that the
      names of Veller and gammon could never come into contract, Sammy, never.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Always exceptin&rsquo; the case of a widder, of course,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Widders, Sammy,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, slightly changing colour. &lsquo;Widders
      are &lsquo;ceptions to ev&rsquo;ry rule. I have heerd how many ordinary women one
      widder&rsquo;s equal to in pint o&rsquo; comin&rsquo; over you. I think it&rsquo;s
      five-and-twenty, but I don&rsquo;t rightly know vether it ain&rsquo;t more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well; that&rsquo;s pretty well,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; continued Mr. Weller, not noticing the interruption, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s a
      wery different thing. You know what the counsel said, Sammy, as defended
      the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n as beat his wife with the poker, venever he got jolly. &ldquo;And
      arter all, my Lord,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a amiable weakness.&rdquo; So I says
      respectin&rsquo; widders, Sammy, and so you&rsquo;ll say, ven you gets as old as me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ought to ha&rsquo; know&rsquo;d better, I know,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ought to ha&rsquo; know&rsquo;d better!&rsquo; repeated Mr. Weller, striking the table with
      his fist. &lsquo;Ought to ha&rsquo; know&rsquo;d better! why, I know a young &lsquo;un as hasn&rsquo;t
      had half nor quarter your eddication&mdash;as hasn&rsquo;t slept about the
      markets, no, not six months&mdash;who&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; scorned to be let in, in such
      a vay; scorned it, Sammy.&rsquo; In the excitement of feeling produced by this
      agonising reflection, Mr. Weller rang the bell, and ordered an additional
      pint of ale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no use talking about it now,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s over, and can&rsquo;t
      be helped, and that&rsquo;s one consolation, as they always says in Turkey, ven
      they cuts the wrong man&rsquo;s head off. It&rsquo;s my innings now, gov&rsquo;nor, and as
      soon as I catches hold o&rsquo; this &lsquo;ere Trotter, I&rsquo;ll have a good &lsquo;un.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you will, Sammy. I hope you will,&rsquo; returned Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s
      your health, Sammy, and may you speedily vipe off the disgrace as you&rsquo;ve
      inflicted on the family name.&rsquo; In honour of this toast Mr. Weller imbibed
      at a draught, at least two-thirds of a newly-arrived pint, and handed it
      over to his son, to dispose of the remainder, which he instantaneously
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, consulting a large double-faced silver
      watch that hung at the end of the copper chain. &lsquo;Now it&rsquo;s time I was up at
      the office to get my vay-bill and see the coach loaded; for coaches,
      Sammy, is like guns&mdash;they requires to be loaded with wery great care,
      afore they go off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this parental and professional joke, Mr. Weller, junior, smiled a
      filial smile. His revered parent continued in a solemn tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to leave you, Samivel, my boy, and there&rsquo;s no telling ven I
      shall see you again. Your mother-in-law may ha&rsquo; been too much for me, or a
      thousand things may have happened by the time you next hears any news o&rsquo; 
      the celebrated Mr. Veller o&rsquo; the Bell Savage. The family name depends wery
      much upon you, Samivel, and I hope you&rsquo;ll do wot&rsquo;s right by it. Upon all
      little pints o&rsquo; breedin&rsquo;, I know I may trust you as vell as if it was my
      own self. So I&rsquo;ve only this here one little bit of adwice to give you. If
      ever you gets to up&rsquo;ards o&rsquo; fifty, and feels disposed to go a-marryin&rsquo; 
      anybody&mdash;no matter who&mdash;jist you shut yourself up in your own
      room, if you&rsquo;ve got one, and pison yourself off hand. Hangin&rsquo;s wulgar, so
      don&rsquo;t you have nothin&rsquo; to say to that. Pison yourself, Samivel, my boy,
      pison yourself, and you&rsquo;ll be glad on it arterwards.&rsquo; With these affecting
      words, Mr. Weller looked steadfastly on his son, and turning slowly upon
      his heel, disappeared from his sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the contemplative mood which these words had awakened, Mr. Samuel
      Weller walked forth from the Great White Horse when his father had left
      him; and bending his steps towards St. Clement&rsquo;s Church, endeavoured to
      dissipate his melancholy, by strolling among its ancient precincts. He had
      loitered about, for some time, when he found himself in a retired spot&mdash;a
      kind of courtyard of venerable appearance&mdash;which he discovered had no
      other outlet than the turning by which he had entered. He was about
      retracing his steps, when he was suddenly transfixed to the spot by a
      sudden appearance; and the mode and manner of this appearance, we now
      proceed to relate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samuel Weller had been staring up at the old brick houses now and
      then, in his deep abstraction, bestowing a wink upon some healthy-looking
      servant girl as she drew up a blind, or threw open a bedroom window, when
      the green gate of a garden at the bottom of the yard opened, and a man
      having emerged therefrom, closed the green gate very carefully after him,
      and walked briskly towards the very spot where Mr. Weller was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, taking this, as an isolated fact, unaccompanied by any attendant
      circumstances, there was nothing very extraordinary in it; because in many
      parts of the world men do come out of gardens, close green gates after
      them, and even walk briskly away, without attracting any particular share
      of public observation. It is clear, therefore, that there must have been
      something in the man, or in his manner, or both, to attract Mr. Weller&rsquo;s
      particular notice. Whether there was, or not, we must leave the reader to
      determine, when we have faithfully recorded the behaviour of the
      individual in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the man had shut the green gate after him, he walked, as we have said
      twice already, with a brisk pace up the courtyard; but he no sooner caught
      sight of Mr. Weller than he faltered, and stopped, as if uncertain, for
      the moment, what course to adopt. As the green gate was closed behind him,
      and there was no other outlet but the one in front, however, he was not
      long in perceiving that he must pass Mr. Samuel Weller to get away. He
      therefore resumed his brisk pace, and advanced, staring straight before
      him. The most extraordinary thing about the man was, that he was
      contorting his face into the most fearful and astonishing grimaces that
      ever were beheld. Nature&rsquo;s handiwork never was disguised with such
      extraordinary artificial carving, as the man had overlaid his countenance
      with in one moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Mr. Weller to himself, as the man approached. &lsquo;This is wery
      odd. I could ha&rsquo; swore it was him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Up came the man, and his face became more frightfully distorted than ever,
      as he drew nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could take my oath to that &lsquo;ere black hair and mulberry suit,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Weller; &lsquo;only I never see such a face as that afore.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Weller said this, the man&rsquo;s features assumed an unearthly twinge,
      perfectly hideous. He was obliged to pass very near Sam, however, and the
      scrutinising glance of that gentleman enabled him to detect, under all
      these appalling twists of feature, something too like the small eyes of
      Mr. Job Trotter to be easily mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo, you Sir!&rsquo; shouted Sam fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo!&rsquo; repeated Sam, still more gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man with the horrible face looked, with the greatest surprise, up the
      court, and down the court, and in at the windows of the houses&mdash;everywhere
      but at Sam Weller&mdash;and took another step forward, when he was brought
      to again by another shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo, you sir!&rsquo; said Sam, for the third time.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no pretending to mistake where the voice came from now, so the
      stranger, having no other resource, at last looked Sam Weller full in the
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It won&rsquo;t do, Job Trotter,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;Come! None o&rsquo; that &lsquo;ere nonsense.
      You ain&rsquo;t so wery &lsquo;andsome that you can afford to throw avay many o&rsquo; your
      good looks. Bring them &lsquo;ere eyes o&rsquo; yourn back into their proper places,
      or I&rsquo;ll knock &lsquo;em out of your head. D&rsquo;ye hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Weller appeared fully disposed to act up to the spirit of this
      address, Mr. Trotter gradually allowed his face to resume its natural
      expression; and then giving a start of joy, exclaimed, &lsquo;What do I see? Mr.
      Walker!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re wery glad to see me, ain&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Glad!&rsquo; exclaimed Job Trotter; &lsquo;Oh, Mr. Walker, if you had but known how I
      have looked forward to this meeting! It is too much, Mr. Walker; I cannot
      bear it, indeed I cannot.&rsquo; And with these words, Mr. Trotter burst into a
      regular inundation of tears, and, flinging his arms around those of Mr.
      Weller, embraced him closely, in an ecstasy of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get off!&rsquo; cried Sam, indignant at this process, and vainly endeavouring
      to extricate himself from the grasp of his enthusiastic acquaintance. &lsquo;Get
      off, I tell you. What are you crying over me for, you portable engine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I am so glad to see you,&rsquo; replied Job Trotter, gradually
      releasing Mr. Weller, as the first symptoms of his pugnacity disappeared.
      &lsquo;Oh, Mr. Walker, this is too much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too much!&rsquo; echoed Sam, &lsquo;I think it is too much&mdash;rayther! Now, what
      have you got to say to me, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Trotter made no reply; for the little pink pocket-handkerchief was in
      full force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you got to say to me, afore I knock your head off?&rsquo; repeated
      Mr. Weller, in a threatening manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh!&rsquo; said Mr. Trotter, with a look of virtuous surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you got to say to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I, Mr. Walker!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t call me Valker; my name&rsquo;s Veller; you know that vell enough. What
      have you got to say to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless you, Mr. Walker&mdash;Weller, I mean&mdash;a great many things, if
      you will come away somewhere, where we can talk comfortably. If you knew
      how I have looked for you, Mr. Weller&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery hard, indeed, I s&rsquo;pose?&rsquo; said Sam drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very, very, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Trotter, without moving a muscle of his
      face. &lsquo;But shake hands, Mr. Weller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam eyed his companion for a few seconds, and then, as if actuated by a
      sudden impulse, complied with his request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How,&rsquo; said Job Trotter, as they walked away, &lsquo;how is your dear, good
      master? Oh, he is a worthy gentleman, Mr. Weller! I hope he didn&rsquo;t catch
      cold, that dreadful night, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a momentary look of deep slyness in Job Trotter&rsquo;s eye, as he
      said this, which ran a thrill through Mr. Weller&rsquo;s clenched fist, as he
      burned with a desire to make a demonstration on his ribs. Sam constrained
      himself, however, and replied that his master was extremely well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I am so glad,&rsquo; replied Mr. Trotter; &lsquo;is he here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is yourn?&rsquo; asked Sam, by way of reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, he is here, and I grieve to say, Mr. Weller, he is going on
      worse than ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, ah!&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, shocking&mdash;terrible!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At a boarding-school?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not at a boarding-school,&rsquo; replied Job Trotter, with the same sly
      look which Sam had noticed before; &lsquo;not at a boarding-school.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the house with the green gate?&rsquo; said Sam, eyeing his companion
      closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no&mdash;oh, not there,&rsquo; replied Job, with a quickness very unusual
      to him, &lsquo;not there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What was you a-doin&rsquo; there?&rsquo; asked Sam, with a sharp glance. &lsquo;Got inside
      the gate by accident, perhaps?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; replied Job, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you my little
      secrets, because, you know, we took such a fancy for each other when we
      first met. You recollect how pleasant we were that morning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; said Sam, impatiently. &lsquo;I remember. Well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied Job, speaking with great precision, and in the low tone of
      a man who communicates an important secret; &lsquo;in that house with the green
      gate, Mr. Weller, they keep a good many servants.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I should think, from the look on it,&rsquo; interposed Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; continued Mr. Trotter, &lsquo;and one of them is a cook, who has saved up
      a little money, Mr. Weller, and is desirous, if she can establish herself
      in life, to open a little shop in the chandlery way, you see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Mr. Weller. Well, Sir, I met her at a chapel that I go to; a very
      neat little chapel in this town, Mr. Weller, where they sing the number
      four collection of hymns, which I generally carry about with me, in a
      little book, which you may perhaps have seen in my hand&mdash;and I got a
      little intimate with her, Mr. Weller, and from that, an acquaintance
      sprung up between us, and I may venture to say, Mr. Weller, that I am to
      be the chandler.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, and a wery amiable chandler you&rsquo;ll make,&rsquo; replied Sam, eyeing Job
      with a side look of intense dislike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The great advantage of this, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; continued Job, his eyes filling
      with tears as he spoke, &lsquo;will be, that I shall be able to leave my present
      disgraceful service with that bad man, and to devote myself to a better
      and more virtuous life; more like the way in which I was brought up, Mr.
      Weller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must ha&rsquo; been wery nicely brought up,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, very, Mr. Weller, very,&rsquo; replied Job. At the recollection of the
      purity of his youthful days, Mr. Trotter pulled forth the pink
      handkerchief, and wept copiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must ha&rsquo; been an uncommon nice boy, to go to school vith,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was, sir,&rsquo; replied Job, heaving a deep sigh; &lsquo;I was the idol of the
      place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at it. What a comfort you must ha&rsquo; been to
      your blessed mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, Mr. Job Trotter inserted an end of the pink handkerchief
      into the corner of each eye, one after the other, and began to weep
      copiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s the matter with the man,&rsquo; said Sam, indignantly. &lsquo;Chelsea
      water-works is nothin&rsquo; to you. What are you melting vith now? The
      consciousness o&rsquo; willainy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot keep my feelings down, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said Job, after a short
      pause. &lsquo;To think that my master should have suspected the conversation I
      had with yours, and so dragged me away in a post-chaise, and after
      persuading the sweet young lady to say she knew nothing of him, and
      bribing the school-mistress to do the same, deserted her for a better
      speculation! Oh! Mr. Weller, it makes me shudder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that was the vay, was it?&rsquo; said Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure it was,&rsquo; replied Job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell,&rsquo; said Sam, as they had now arrived near the hotel, &lsquo;I vant to have
      a little bit o&rsquo; talk with you, Job; so if you&rsquo;re not partickler engaged, I
      should like to see you at the Great White Horse to-night, somewheres about
      eight o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be sure to come,&rsquo; said Job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you&rsquo;d better,&rsquo; replied Sam, with a very meaning look, &lsquo;or else I
      shall perhaps be askin&rsquo; arter you, at the other side of the green gate,
      and then I might cut you out, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be sure to be with you, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Trotter; and wringing
      Sam&rsquo;s hand with the utmost fervour, he walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care, Job Trotter, take care,&rsquo; said Sam, looking after him, &lsquo;or I
      shall be one too many for you this time. I shall, indeed.&rsquo; Having uttered
      this soliloquy, and looked after Job till he was to be seen no more, Mr.
      Weller made the best of his way to his master&rsquo;s bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all in training, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s in training, Sam?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve found &lsquo;em out, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Found out who?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That &lsquo;ere queer customer, and the melan-cholly chap with the black hair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible, Sam!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with the greatest energy. &lsquo;Where are
      they, Sam: where are they?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, hush!&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; and as he assisted Mr. Pickwick to
      dress, he detailed the plan of action on which he proposed to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But when is this to be done, Sam?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All in good time, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it was done in good time, or not, will be seen hereafter.

      CHAPTER XXIV. WHEREIN MR. PETER MAGNUS GROWS JEALOUS, AND THE MIDDLE-AGED
      LADY APPREHENSIVE, WHICH BRINGS THE PICKWICKIANS WITHIN THE GRASP OF THE
      LAW
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Mr. Pickwick
      descended to the room in which he and Mr. Peter Magnus had spent the
      preceding evening, he found that gentleman with the major part of the
      contents of the two bags, the leathern hat-box, and the brown-paper
      parcel, displaying to all possible advantage on his person, while he
      himself was pacing up and down the room in a state of the utmost
      excitement and agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-morning, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Peter Magnus. &lsquo;What do you think of this,
      Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very effective indeed,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, surveying the garments of
      Mr. Peter Magnus with a good-natured smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I think it&rsquo;ll do,&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus. &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick, Sir, I have sent
      up my card.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the waiter brought back word, that she would see me at eleven&mdash;at
      eleven, Sir; it only wants a quarter now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very near the time,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it is rather near,&rsquo; replied Mr. Magnus, &lsquo;rather too near to be
      pleasant&mdash;eh! Mr. Pickwick, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Confidence is a great thing in these cases,&rsquo; observed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe it is, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Peter Magnus. &lsquo;I am very confident, Sir.
      Really, Mr. Pickwick, I do not see why a man should feel any fear in such
      a case as this, sir. What is it, Sir? There&rsquo;s nothing to be ashamed of;
      it&rsquo;s a matter of mutual accommodation, nothing more. Husband on one side,
      wife on the other. That&rsquo;s my view of the matter, Mr. Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a very philosophical one,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;But breakfast is
      waiting, Mr. Magnus. Come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Down they sat to breakfast, but it was evident, notwithstanding the
      boasting of Mr. Peter Magnus, that he laboured under a very considerable
      degree of nervousness, of which loss of appetite, a propensity to upset
      the tea-things, a spectral attempt at drollery, and an irresistible
      inclination to look at the clock, every other second, were among the
      principal symptoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He-he-he,&rsquo; tittered Mr. Magnus, affecting cheerfulness, and gasping with
      agitation. &lsquo;It only wants two minutes, Mr. Pickwick. Am I pale, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not very,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Pickwick; but have you ever done this sort of
      thing in your time?&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean proposing?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with great energy, &lsquo;never.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have no idea, then, how it&rsquo;s best to begin?&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I may have formed some ideas upon the subject,
      but, as I have never submitted them to the test of experience, I should be
      sorry if you were induced to regulate your proceedings by them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should feel very much obliged to you, for any advice, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Magnus, taking another look at the clock, the hand of which was verging on
      the five minutes past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with the profound solemnity with which
      that great man could, when he pleased, render his remarks so deeply
      impressive. &lsquo;I should commence, sir, with a tribute to the lady&rsquo;s beauty
      and excellent qualities; from them, Sir, I should diverge to my own
      unworthiness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unworthiness for <i>her </i>only, mind, sir,&rsquo; resumed Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;for
      to show that I was not wholly unworthy, sir, I should take a brief review
      of my past life, and present condition. I should argue, by analogy, that
      to anybody else, I must be a very desirable object. I should then
      expatiate on the warmth of my love, and the depth of my devotion. Perhaps
      I might then be tempted to seize her hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I see,&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus; &lsquo;that would be a very great point.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should then, Sir,&rsquo; continued Mr. Pickwick, growing warmer as the
      subject presented itself in more glowing colours before him&mdash;&lsquo;I
      should then, Sir, come to the plain and simple question, &ldquo;Will you have
      me?&rdquo; I think I am justified in assuming that upon this, she would turn
      away her head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think that may be taken for granted?&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus; &lsquo;because, if
      she did not do that at the right place, it would be embarrassing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think she would,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Upon this, sir, I should squeeze
      her hand, and I think&mdash;I think, Mr. Magnus&mdash;that after I had
      done that, supposing there was no refusal, I should gently draw away the
      handkerchief, which my slight knowledge of human nature leads me to
      suppose the lady would be applying to her eyes at the moment, and steal a
      respectful kiss. I think I should kiss her, Mr. Magnus; and at this
      particular point, I am decidedly of opinion that if the lady were going to
      take me at all, she would murmur into my ears a bashful acceptance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Magnus started; gazed on Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s intelligent face, for a short
      time in silence; and then (the dial pointing to the ten minutes past)
      shook him warmly by the hand, and rushed desperately from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick had taken a few strides to and fro; and the small hand of the
      clock following the latter part of his example, had arrived at the figure
      which indicates the half-hour, when the door suddenly opened. He turned
      round to meet Mr. Peter Magnus, and encountered, in his stead, the joyous
      face of Mr. Tupman, the serene countenance of Mr. Winkle, and the
      intellectual lineaments of Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Pickwick greeted them, Mr. Peter Magnus tripped into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friends, the gentleman I was speaking of&mdash;Mr. Magnus,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your servant, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus, evidently in a high state of
      excitement; &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick, allow me to speak to you one moment, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, Mr. Magnus harnessed his forefinger to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      buttonhole, and, drawing him to a window recess, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Congratulate me, Mr. Pickwick; I followed your advice to the very
      letter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it was all correct, was it?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was, Sir. Could not possibly have been better,&rsquo; replied Mr. Magnus.
      &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick, she is mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I congratulate you, with all my heart,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, warmly
      shaking his new friend by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must see her. Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus; &lsquo;this way, if you please. Excuse
      us for one instant, gentlemen.&rsquo; Hurrying on in this way, Mr. Peter Magnus
      drew Mr. Pickwick from the room. He paused at the next door in the
      passage, and tapped gently thereat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; said a female voice. And in they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Witherfield,&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus, &lsquo;allow me to introduce my very
      particular friend, Mr. Pickwick. Mr. Pickwick, I beg to make you known to
      Miss Witherfield.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady was at the upper end of the room. As Mr. Pickwick bowed, he took
      his spectacles from his waistcoat pocket, and put them on; a process which
      he had no sooner gone through, than, uttering an exclamation of surprise,
      Mr. Pickwick retreated several paces, and the lady, with a half-suppressed
      scream, hid her face in her hands, and dropped into a chair; whereupon Mr.
      Peter Magnus was stricken motionless on the spot, and gazed from one to
      the other, with a countenance expressive of the extremities of horror and
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      This certainly was, to all appearance, very unaccountable behaviour; but
      the fact is, that Mr. Pickwick no sooner put on his spectacles, than he at
      once recognised in the future Mrs. Magnus the lady into whose room he had
      so unwarrantably intruded on the previous night; and the spectacles had no
      sooner crossed Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s nose, than the lady at once identified the
      countenance which she had seen surrounded by all the horrors of a
      nightcap. So the lady screamed, and Mr. Pickwick started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Magnus, lost in astonishment, &lsquo;what is the
      meaning of this, Sir? What is the meaning of it, Sir?&rsquo; added Mr. Magnus,
      in a threatening, and a louder tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, somewhat indignant at the very sudden manner in
      which Mr. Peter Magnus had conjugated himself into the imperative mood, &lsquo;I
      decline answering that question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You decline it, Sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;I object to say anything which may
      compromise that lady, or awaken unpleasant recollections in her breast,
      without her consent and permission.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Witherfield,&rsquo; said Mr. Peter Magnus, &lsquo;do you know this person?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Know him!&rsquo; repeated the middle-aged lady, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, know him, ma&rsquo;am; I said know him,&rsquo; replied Mr. Magnus, with
      ferocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have seen him,&rsquo; replied the middle-aged lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Magnus, &lsquo;where?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That,&rsquo; said the middle-aged lady, rising from her seat, and averting her
      head&mdash;&lsquo;that I would not reveal for worlds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I understand you, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;and respect your delicacy;
      it shall never be revealed by <i>me</i> depend upon it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus, &lsquo;considering the situation in
      which I am placed with regard to yourself, you carry this matter off with
      tolerable coolness&mdash;tolerable coolness, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cruel Mr. Magnus!&rsquo; said the middle-aged lady; here she wept very
      copiously indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Address your observations to me, sir,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;I alone
      am to blame, if anybody be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you alone are to blame, are you, sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus; &lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;see
      through this, sir. You repent of your determination now, do you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My determination!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your determination, Sir. Oh! don&rsquo;t stare at me, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus; &lsquo;I
      recollect your words last night, Sir. You came down here, sir, to expose
      the treachery and falsehood of an individual on whose truth and honour you
      had placed implicit reliance&mdash;eh?&rsquo; Here Mr. Peter Magnus indulged in
      a prolonged sneer; and taking off his green spectacles&mdash;which he
      probably found superfluous in his fit of jealousy&mdash;rolled his little
      eyes about, in a manner frightful to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; said Mr. Magnus; and then he repeated the sneer with increased
      effect. &lsquo;But you shall answer it, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Answer what?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Magnus, striding up and down the room.
      &lsquo;Never mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There must be something very comprehensive in this phrase of &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; 
      for we do not recollect to have ever witnessed a quarrel in the street, at
      a theatre, public room, or elsewhere, in which it has not been the
      standard reply to all belligerent inquiries. &lsquo;Do you call yourself a
      gentleman, sir?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Never mind, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Did I offer to say anything to the young woman, sir?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Never mind,
      sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you want your head knocked up against that wall, sir?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Never
      mind, sir.&rsquo; It is observable, too, that there would appear to be some
      hidden taunt in this universal &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; which rouses more indignation
      in the bosom of the individual addressed, than the most lavish abuse could
      possibly awaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not mean to assert that the application of this brevity to himself,
      struck exactly that indignation to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s soul, which it would
      infallibly have roused in a vulgar breast. We merely record the fact that
      Mr. Pickwick opened the room door, and abruptly called out, &lsquo;Tupman, come
      here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman immediately presented himself, with a look of very considerable
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tupman,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;a secret of some delicacy, in which that
      lady is concerned, is the cause of a difference which has just arisen
      between this gentleman and myself. When I assure him, in your presence,
      that it has no relation to himself, and is not in any way connected with
      his affairs, I need hardly beg you to take notice that if he continue to
      dispute it, he expresses a doubt of my veracity, which I shall consider
      extremely insulting.&rsquo; As Mr. Pickwick said this, he looked encyclopedias
      at Mr. Peter Magnus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s upright and honourable bearing, coupled with that force and
      energy of speech which so eminently distinguished him, would have carried
      conviction to any reasonable mind; but, unfortunately, at that particular
      moment, the mind of Mr. Peter Magnus was in anything but reasonable order.
      Consequently, instead of receiving Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s explanation as he ought
      to have done, he forthwith proceeded to work himself into a red-hot,
      scorching, consuming passion, and to talk about what was due to his own
      feelings, and all that sort of thing; adding force to his declamation by
      striding to and fro, and pulling his hair&mdash;amusements which he would
      vary occasionally, by shaking his fist in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s philanthropic
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick, in his turn, conscious of his own innocence and rectitude,
      and irritated by having unfortunately involved the middle-aged lady in
      such an unpleasant affair, was not so quietly disposed as was his wont.
      The consequence was, that words ran high, and voices higher; and at length
      Mr. Magnus told Mr. Pickwick he should hear from him; to which Mr.
      Pickwick replied, with laudable politeness, that the sooner he heard from
      him the better; whereupon the middle-aged lady rushed in terror from the
      room, out of which Mr. Tupman dragged Mr. Pickwick, leaving Mr. Peter
      Magnus to himself and meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the middle-aged lady had mingled much with the busy world, or had
      profited at all by the manners and customs of those who make the laws and
      set the fashions, she would have known that this sort of ferocity is the
      most harmless thing in nature; but as she had lived for the most part in
      the country, and never read the parliamentary debates, she was little
      versed in these particular refinements of civilised life. Accordingly,
      when she had gained her bedchamber, bolted herself in, and began to
      meditate on the scene she had just witnessed, the most terrific pictures
      of slaughter and destruction presented themselves to her imagination;
      among which, a full-length portrait of Mr. Peter Magnus borne home by four
      men, with the embellishment of a whole barrelful of bullets in his left
      side, was among the very least. The more the middle-aged lady meditated,
      the more terrified she became; and at length she determined to repair to
      the house of the principal magistrate of the town, and request him to
      secure the persons of Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this decision the middle-aged lady was impelled by a variety of
      considerations, the chief of which was the incontestable proof it would
      afford of her devotion to Mr. Peter Magnus, and her anxiety for his
      safety. She was too well acquainted with his jealous temperament to
      venture the slightest allusion to the real cause of her agitation on
      beholding Mr. Pickwick; and she trusted to her own influence and power of
      persuasion with the little man, to quell his boisterous jealousy,
      supposing that Mr. Pickwick were removed, and no fresh quarrel could
      arise. Filled with these reflections, the middle-aged lady arrayed herself
      in her bonnet and shawl, and repaired to the mayor&rsquo;s dwelling straightway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now George Nupkins, Esquire, the principal magistrate aforesaid, was as
      grand a personage as the fastest walker would find out, between sunrise
      and sunset, on the twenty-first of June, which being, according to the
      almanacs, the longest day in the whole year, would naturally afford him
      the longest period for his search. On this particular morning, Mr. Nupkins
      was in a state of the utmost excitement and irritation, for there had been
      a rebellion in the town; all the day-scholars at the largest day-school
      had conspired to break the windows of an obnoxious apple-seller, and had
      hooted the beadle and pelted the constabulary&mdash;an elderly gentleman
      in top-boots, who had been called out to repress the tumult, and who had
      been a peace-officer, man and boy, for half a century at least. And Mr.
      Nupkins was sitting in his easy-chair, frowning with majesty, and boiling
      with rage, when a lady was announced on pressing, private, and particular
      business. Mr. Nupkins looked calmly terrible, and commanded that the lady
      should be shown in; which command, like all the mandates of emperors, and
      magistrates, and other great potentates of the earth, was forthwith
      obeyed; and Miss Witherfield, interestingly agitated, was ushered in
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Muzzle!&rsquo; said the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muzzle was an undersized footman, with a long body and short legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Muzzle!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, your Worship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Place a chair, and leave the room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, your Worship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, ma&rsquo;am, will you state your business?&rsquo; said the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is of a very painful kind, Sir,&rsquo; said Miss Witherfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very likely, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the magistrate. &lsquo;Compose your feelings, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
      Here Mr. Nupkins looked benignant. &lsquo;And then tell me what legal business
      brings you here, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; Here the magistrate triumphed over the man; and
      he looked stern again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very distressing to me, Sir, to give this information,&rsquo; said Miss
      Witherfield, &lsquo;but I fear a duel is going to be fought here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; said the magistrate. &lsquo;Where, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Ipswich.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In Ipswich, ma&rsquo;am! A duel in Ipswich!&rsquo; said the magistrate, perfectly
      aghast at the notion. &lsquo;Impossible, ma&rsquo;am; nothing of the kind can be
      contemplated in this town, I am persuaded. Bless my soul, ma&rsquo;am, are you
      aware of the activity of our local magistracy? Do you happen to have
      heard, ma&rsquo;am, that I rushed into a prize-ring on the fourth of May last,
      attended by only sixty special constables; and, at the hazard of falling a
      sacrifice to the angry passions of an infuriated multitude, prohibited a
      pugilistic contest between the Middlesex Dumpling and the Suffolk Bantam?
      A duel in Ipswich, ma&rsquo;am? I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;I do not think,&rsquo; said the
      magistrate, reasoning with himself, &lsquo;that any two men can have had the
      hardihood to plan such a breach of the peace, in this town.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My information is, unfortunately, but too correct,&rsquo; said the middle-aged
      lady; &lsquo;I was present at the quarrel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a most extraordinary thing,&rsquo; said the astounded magistrate.
      &lsquo;Muzzle!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, your Worship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Send Mr. Jinks here, directly! Instantly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, your Worship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Muzzle retired; and a pale, sharp-nosed, half-fed, shabbily-clad clerk, of
      middle age, entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Jinks,&rsquo; said the magistrate. &lsquo;Mr. Jinks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Jinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This lady, Mr. Jinks, has come here, to give information of an intended
      duel in this town.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jinks, not knowing exactly what to do, smiled a dependent&rsquo;s smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you laughing at, Mr. Jinks?&rsquo; said the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jinks looked serious instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Jinks,&rsquo; said the magistrate, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a fool.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jinks looked humbly at the great man, and bit the top of his pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may see something very comical in this information, Sir&mdash;but I
      can tell you this, Mr. Jinks, that you have very little to laugh at,&rsquo; said
      the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hungry-looking Jinks sighed, as if he were quite aware of the fact of
      his having very little indeed to be merry about; and, being ordered to
      take the lady&rsquo;s information, shambled to a seat, and proceeded to write it
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This man, Pickwick, is the principal, I understand?&rsquo; said the magistrate,
      when the statement was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is,&rsquo; said the middle-aged lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the other rioter&mdash;what&rsquo;s his name, Mr. Jinks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tupman, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tupman is the second?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The other principal, you say, has absconded, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Miss Witherfield, with a short cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said the magistrate. &lsquo;These are two cut-throats from London,
      who have come down here to destroy his Majesty&rsquo;s population, thinking that
      at this distance from the capital, the arm of the law is weak and
      paralysed. They shall be made an example of. Draw up the warrants, Mr.
      Jinks. Muzzle!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, your Worship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Grummer downstairs?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, your Worship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Send him up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The obsequious Muzzle retired, and presently returned, introducing the
      elderly gentleman in the top-boots, who was chiefly remarkable for a
      bottle-nose, a hoarse voice, a snuff-coloured surtout, and a wandering
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grummer,&rsquo; said the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Wash-up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is the town quiet now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty well, your Wash-up,&rsquo; replied Grummer. &lsquo;Pop&rsquo;lar feeling has in a
      measure subsided, consekens o&rsquo; the boys having dispersed to cricket.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing but vigorous measures will do in these times, Grummer,&rsquo; said the
      magistrate, in a determined manner. &lsquo;If the authority of the king&rsquo;s
      officers is set at naught, we must have the riot act read. If the civil
      power cannot protect these windows, Grummer, the military must protect the
      civil power, and the windows too. I believe that is a maxim of the
      constitution, Mr. Jinks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, sir,&rsquo; said Jinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; said the magistrate, signing the warrants. &lsquo;Grummer, you will
      bring these persons before me, this afternoon. You will find them at the
      Great White Horse. You recollect the case of the Middlesex Dumpling and
      the Suffolk Bantam, Grummer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grummer intimated, by a retrospective shake of the head, that he
      should never forget it&mdash;as indeed it was not likely he would, so long
      as it continued to be cited daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is even more unconstitutional,&rsquo; said the magistrate; &lsquo;this is even a
      greater breach of the peace, and a grosser infringement of his Majesty&rsquo;s
      prerogative. I believe duelling is one of his Majesty&rsquo;s most undoubted
      prerogatives, Mr. Jinks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Expressly stipulated in Magna Charta, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Jinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One of the brightest jewels in the British crown, wrung from his Majesty
      by the barons, I believe, Mr. Jinks?&rsquo; said the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Jinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said the magistrate, drawing himself up proudly, &lsquo;it shall
      not be violated in this portion of his dominions. Grummer, procure
      assistance, and execute these warrants with as little delay as possible.
      Muzzle!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, your Worship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Show the lady out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Witherfield retired, deeply impressed with the magistrate&rsquo;s learning
      and research; Mr. Nupkins retired to lunch; Mr. Jinks retired within
      himself&mdash;that being the only retirement he had, except the
      sofa-bedstead in the small parlour which was occupied by his landlady&rsquo;s
      family in the daytime&mdash;and Mr. Grummer retired, to wipe out, by his
      mode of discharging his present commission, the insult which had been
      fastened upon himself, and the other representative of his Majesty&mdash;the
      beadle&mdash;in the course of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these resolute and determined preparations for the conservation of
      the king&rsquo;s peace were pending, Mr. Pickwick and his friends, wholly
      unconscious of the mighty events in progress, had sat quietly down to
      dinner; and very talkative and companionable they all were. Mr. Pickwick
      was in the very act of relating his adventure of the preceding night, to
      the great amusement of his followers, Mr. Tupman especially, when the door
      opened, and a somewhat forbidding countenance peeped into the room. The
      eyes in the forbidding countenance looked very earnestly at Mr. Pickwick,
      for several seconds, and were to all appearance satisfied with their
      investigation; for the body to which the forbidding countenance belonged,
      slowly brought itself into the apartment, and presented the form of an
      elderly individual in top-boots&mdash;not to keep the reader any longer in
      suspense, in short, the eyes were the wandering eyes of Mr. Grummer, and
      the body was the body of the same gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grummer&rsquo;s mode of proceeding was professional, but peculiar. His first
      act was to bolt the door on the inside; his second, to polish his head and
      countenance very carefully with a cotton handkerchief; his third, to place
      his hat, with the cotton handkerchief in it, on the nearest chair; and his
      fourth, to produce from the breast-pocket of his coat a short truncheon,
      surmounted by a brazen crown, with which he beckoned to Mr. Pickwick with
      a grave and ghost-like air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Snodgrass was the first to break the astonished silence. He looked
      steadily at Mr. Grummer for a brief space, and then said emphatically,
      &lsquo;This is a private room, Sir. A private room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grummer shook his head, and replied, &lsquo;No room&rsquo;s private to his Majesty
      when the street door&rsquo;s once passed. That&rsquo;s law. Some people maintains that
      an Englishman&rsquo;s house is his castle. That&rsquo;s gammon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pickwickians gazed on each other with wondering eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which is Mr. Tupman?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Grummer. He had an intuitive
      perception of Mr. Pickwick; he knew him at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name&rsquo;s Tupman,&rsquo; said that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name&rsquo;s Law,&rsquo; said Mr. Grummer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Law,&rsquo; replied Mr. Grummer&mdash;&lsquo;Law, civil power, and exekative; them&rsquo;s
      my titles; here&rsquo;s my authority. Blank Tupman, blank Pickwick&mdash;against
      the peace of our sufferin&rsquo; lord the king&mdash;stattit in the case made
      and purwided&mdash;and all regular. I apprehend you Pickwick! Tupman&mdash;the
      aforesaid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by this insolence?&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, starting up; &lsquo;leave
      the room!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo,&rsquo; said Mr. Grummer, retreating very expeditiously to the door, and
      opening it an inch or two, &lsquo;Dubbley.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said a deep voice from the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come for&rsquo;ard, Dubbley.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the word of command, a dirty-faced man, something over six feet high,
      and stout in proportion, squeezed himself through the half-open door
      (making his face very red in the process), and entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is the other specials outside, Dubbley?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Grummer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dubbley, who was a man of few words, nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Order in the diwision under your charge, Dubbley,&rsquo; said Mr. Grummer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dubbley did as he was desired; and half a dozen men, each with a short
      truncheon and a brass crown, flocked into the room. Mr. Grummer pocketed
      his staff, and looked at Mr. Dubbley; Mr. Dubbley pocketed his staff and
      looked at the division; the division pocketed their staves and looked at
      Messrs. Tupman and Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick and his followers rose as one man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the meaning of this atrocious intrusion upon my privacy?&rsquo; said
      Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who dares apprehend me?&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want here, scoundrels?&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle said nothing, but he fixed his eyes on Grummer, and bestowed a
      look upon him, which, if he had had any feeling, must have pierced his
      brain. As it was, however, it had no visible effect on him whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the executive perceived that Mr. Pickwick and his friends were
      disposed to resist the authority of the law, they very significantly
      turned up their coat sleeves, as if knocking them down in the first
      instance, and taking them up afterwards, were a mere professional act
      which had only to be thought of to be done, as a matter of course. This
      demonstration was not lost upon Mr. Pickwick. He conferred a few moments
      with Mr. Tupman apart, and then signified his readiness to proceed to the
      mayor&rsquo;s residence, merely begging the parties then and there assembled, to
      take notice, that it was his firm intention to resent this monstrous
      invasion of his privileges as an Englishman, the instant he was at
      liberty; whereat the parties then and there assembled laughed very
      heartily, with the single exception of Mr. Grummer, who seemed to consider
      that any slight cast upon the divine right of magistrates was a species of
      blasphemy not to be tolerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Mr. Pickwick had signified his readiness to bow to the laws of
      his country, and just when the waiters, and hostlers, and chambermaids,
      and post-boys, who had anticipated a delightful commotion from his
      threatened obstinacy, began to turn away, disappointed and disgusted, a
      difficulty arose which had not been foreseen. With every sentiment of
      veneration for the constituted authorities, Mr. Pickwick resolutely
      protested against making his appearance in the public streets, surrounded
      and guarded by the officers of justice, like a common criminal. Mr.
      Grummer, in the then disturbed state of public feeling (for it was
      half-holiday, and the boys had not yet gone home), as resolutely protested
      against walking on the opposite side of the way, and taking Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      parole that he would go straight to the magistrate&rsquo;s; and both Mr.
      Pickwick and Mr. Tupman as strenuously objected to the expense of a
      post-coach, which was the only respectable conveyance that could be
      obtained. The dispute ran high, and the dilemma lasted long; and just as
      the executive were on the point of overcoming Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s objection to
      walking to the magistrate&rsquo;s, by the trite expedient of carrying him
      thither, it was recollected that there stood in the inn yard, an old
      sedan-chair, which, having been originally built for a gouty gentleman
      with funded property, would hold Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman, at least as
      conveniently as a modern post-chaise. The chair was hired, and brought
      into the hall; Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman squeezed themselves inside, and
      pulled down the blinds; a couple of chairmen were speedily found; and the
      procession started in grand order. The specials surrounded the body of the
      vehicle; Mr. Grummer and Mr. Dubbley marched triumphantly in front; Mr.
      Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle walked arm-in-arm behind; and the unsoaped of
      Ipswich brought up the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shopkeepers of the town, although they had a very indistinct notion of
      the nature of the offence, could not but be much edified and gratified by
      this spectacle. Here was the strong arm of the law, coming down with
      twenty gold-beater force, upon two offenders from the metropolis itself;
      the mighty engine was directed by their own magistrate, and worked by
      their own officers; and both the criminals, by their united efforts, were
      securely shut up, in the narrow compass of one sedan-chair. Many were the
      expressions of approval and admiration which greeted Mr. Grummer, as he
      headed the cavalcade, staff in hand; loud and long were the shouts raised
      by the unsoaped; and amidst these united testimonials of public
      approbation, the procession moved slowly and majestically along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller, habited in his morning jacket, with the black calico sleeves,
      was returning in a rather desponding state from an unsuccessful survey of
      the mysterious house with the green gate, when, raising his eyes, he
      beheld a crowd pouring down the street, surrounding an object which had
      very much the appearance of a sedan-chair. Willing to divert his thoughts
      from the failure of his enterprise, he stepped aside to see the crowd
      pass; and finding that they were cheering away, very much to their own
      satisfaction, forthwith began (by way of raising his spirits) to cheer
      too, with all his might and main.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grummer passed, and Mr. Dubbley passed, and the sedan passed, and the
      bodyguard of specials passed, and Sam was still responding to the
      enthusiastic cheers of the mob, and waving his hat about as if he were in
      the very last extreme of the wildest joy (though, of course, he had not
      the faintest idea of the matter in hand), when he was suddenly stopped by
      the unexpected appearance of Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/0466m.jpg" alt="0466m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0466.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the row, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n?&rsquo; cried Sam. &lsquo;Who have they got in this here
      watch-box in mournin&rsquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Both gentlemen replied together, but their words were lost in the tumult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is it?&rsquo; cried Sam again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more was a joint reply returned; and, though the words were
      inaudible, Sam saw by the motion of the two pairs of lips that they had
      uttered the magic word &lsquo;Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was enough. In another minute Mr. Weller had made his way through the
      crowd, stopped the chairmen, and confronted the portly Grummer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo, old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n!&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;Who have you got in this here
      conweyance?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stand back,&rsquo; said Mr. Grummer, whose dignity, like the dignity of a great
      many other men, had been wondrously augmented by a little popularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Knock him down, if he don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Mr. Dubbley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m wery much obliged to you, old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n,&rsquo; replied Sam, &lsquo;for
      consulting my conwenience, and I&rsquo;m still more obliged to the other
      gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, who looks as if he&rsquo;d just escaped from a giant&rsquo;s carrywan, for
      his wery &lsquo;andsome suggestion; but I should prefer your givin&rsquo; me a answer
      to my question, if it&rsquo;s all the same to you.&mdash;How are you, Sir?&rsquo; This
      last observation was addressed with a patronising air to Mr. Pickwick, who
      was peeping through the front window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grummer, perfectly speechless with indignation, dragged the truncheon
      with the brass crown from its particular pocket, and flourished it before
      Sam&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s wery pretty, &lsquo;specially the crown, which is uncommon
      like the real one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stand back!&rsquo; said the outraged Mr. Grummer. By way of adding force to the
      command, he thrust the brass emblem of royalty into Sam&rsquo;s neckcloth with
      one hand, and seized Sam&rsquo;s collar with the other&mdash;a compliment which
      Mr. Weller returned by knocking him down out of hand, having previously
      with the utmost consideration, knocked down a chairman for him to lie
      upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Mr. Winkle was seized with a temporary attack of that species of
      insanity which originates in a sense of injury, or animated by this
      display of Mr. Weller&rsquo;s valour, is uncertain; but certain it is, that he
      no sooner saw Mr. Grummer fall than he made a terrific onslaught on a
      small boy who stood next him; whereupon Mr. Snodgrass, in a truly
      Christian spirit, and in order that he might take no one unawares,
      announced in a very loud tone that he was going to begin, and proceeded to
      take off his coat with the utmost deliberation. He was immediately
      surrounded and secured; and it is but common justice both to him and Mr.
      Winkle to say, that they did not make the slightest attempt to rescue
      either themselves or Mr. Weller; who, after a most vigorous resistance,
      was overpowered by numbers and taken prisoner. The procession then
      reformed; the chairmen resumed their stations; and the march was
      re-commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s indignation during the whole of this proceeding was beyond
      all bounds. He could just see Sam upsetting the specials, and flying about
      in every direction; and that was all he could see, for the sedan doors
      wouldn&rsquo;t open, and the blinds wouldn&rsquo;t pull up. At length, with the
      assistance of Mr. Tupman, he managed to push open the roof; and mounting
      on the seat, and steadying himself as well as he could, by placing his
      hand on that gentleman&rsquo;s shoulder, Mr. Pickwick proceeded to address the
      multitude; to dwell upon the unjustifiable manner in which he had been
      treated; and to call upon them to take notice that his servant had been
      first assaulted. In this order they reached the magistrate&rsquo;s house; the
      chairmen trotting, the prisoners following, Mr. Pickwick oratorising, and
      the crowd shouting.

      CHAPTER XXV. SHOWING, AMONG A VARIETY OF PLEASANT MATTERS, HOW MAJESTIC
      AND IMPARTIAL MR. NUPKINS WAS; AND HOW MR. WELLER RETURNED MR. JOB
      TROTTER&rsquo;S SHUTTLECOCK AS HEAVILY AS IT CAME&mdash;WITH ANOTHER MATTER,
      WHICH WILL BE FOUND IN ITS PLACE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">V</span>iolent was Mr.
      Weller&rsquo;s indignation as he was borne along; numerous were the allusions to
      the personal appearance and demeanour of Mr. Grummer and his companion;
      and valorous were the defiances to any six of the gentlemen present, in
      which he vented his dissatisfaction. Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle listened
      with gloomy respect to the torrent of eloquence which their leader poured
      forth from the sedan-chair, and the rapid course of which not all Mr.
      Tupman&rsquo;s earnest entreaties to have the lid of the vehicle closed, were
      able to check for an instant. But Mr. Weller&rsquo;s anger quickly gave way to
      curiosity when the procession turned down the identical courtyard in which
      he had met with the runaway Job Trotter; and curiosity was exchanged for a
      feeling of the most gleeful astonishment, when the all-important Mr.
      Grummer, commanding the sedan-bearers to halt, advanced with dignified and
      portentous steps to the very green gate from which Job Trotter had
      emerged, and gave a mighty pull at the bell-handle which hung at the side
      thereof. The ring was answered by a very smart and pretty-faced
      servant-girl, who, after holding up her hands in astonishment at the
      rebellious appearance of the prisoners, and the impassioned language of
      Mr. Pickwick, summoned Mr. Muzzle. Mr. Muzzle opened one half of the
      carriage gate, to admit the sedan, the captured ones, and the specials;
      and immediately slammed it in the faces of the mob, who, indignant at
      being excluded, and anxious to see what followed, relieved their feelings
      by kicking at the gate and ringing the bell, for an hour or two
      afterwards. In this amusement they all took part by turns, except three or
      four fortunate individuals, who, having discovered a grating in the gate,
      which commanded a view of nothing, stared through it with the
      indefatigable perseverance with which people will flatten their noses
      against the front windows of a chemist&rsquo;s shop, when a drunken man, who has
      been run over by a dog-cart in the street, is undergoing a surgical
      inspection in the back-parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of a flight of steps, leading to the house door, which was
      guarded on either side by an American aloe in a green tub, the sedan-chair
      stopped. Mr. Pickwick and his friends were conducted into the hall,
      whence, having been previously announced by Muzzle, and ordered in by Mr.
      Nupkins, they were ushered into the worshipful presence of that
      public-spirited officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene was an impressive one, well calculated to strike terror to the
      hearts of culprits, and to impress them with an adequate idea of the stern
      majesty of the law. In front of a big book-case, in a big chair, behind a
      big table, and before a big volume, sat Mr. Nupkins, looking a full size
      larger than any one of them, big as they were. The table was adorned with
      piles of papers; and above the farther end of it, appeared the head and
      shoulders of Mr. Jinks, who was busily engaged in looking as busy as
      possible. The party having all entered, Muzzle carefully closed the door,
      and placed himself behind his master&rsquo;s chair to await his orders. Mr.
      Nupkins threw himself back with thrilling solemnity, and scrutinised the
      faces of his unwilling visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Grummer, who is that person?&rsquo; said Mr. Nupkins, pointing to Mr.
      Pickwick, who, as the spokesman of his friends, stood hat in hand, bowing
      with the utmost politeness and respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This here&rsquo;s Pickvick, your Wash-up,&rsquo; said Grummer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, none o&rsquo; that &lsquo;ere, old Strike-a-light,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Weller,
      elbowing himself into the front rank. &lsquo;Beg your pardon, sir, but this here
      officer o&rsquo; yourn in the gambooge tops, &lsquo;ull never earn a decent livin&rsquo; as
      a master o&rsquo; the ceremonies any vere. This here, sir&rsquo; continued Mr. Weller,
      thrusting Grummer aside, and addressing the magistrate with pleasant
      familiarity, &lsquo;this here is S. Pickvick, Esquire; this here&rsquo;s Mr. Tupman;
      that &lsquo;ere&rsquo;s Mr. Snodgrass; and farder on, next him on the t&rsquo;other side,
      Mr. Winkle&mdash;all wery nice gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, Sir, as you&rsquo;ll be wery happy to
      have the acquaintance on; so the sooner you commits these here officers o&rsquo; 
      yourn to the tread-mill for a month or two, the sooner we shall begin to
      be on a pleasant understanding. Business first, pleasure arterwards, as
      King Richard the Third said when he stabbed the t&rsquo;other king in the Tower,
      afore he smothered the babbies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the conclusion of this address, Mr. Weller brushed his hat with his
      right elbow, and nodded benignly to Jinks, who had heard him throughout
      with unspeakable awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is this man, Grummer?&rsquo; said the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery desp&rsquo;rate ch&rsquo;racter, your Wash-up,&rsquo; replied Grummer. &lsquo;He attempted
      to rescue the prisoners, and assaulted the officers; so we took him into
      custody, and brought him here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You did quite right,&rsquo; replied the magistrate. &lsquo;He is evidently a
      desperate ruffian.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is my servant, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! he is your servant, is he?&rsquo; said Mr. Nupkins. &lsquo;A conspiracy to defeat
      the ends of justice, and murder its officers. Pickwick&rsquo;s servant. Put that
      down, Mr. Jinks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jinks did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your name, fellow?&rsquo; thundered Mr. Nupkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Veller,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A very good name for the Newgate Calendar,&rsquo; said Mr. Nupkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a joke; so Jinks, Grummer, Dubbley, all the specials, and Muzzle,
      went into fits of laughter of five minutes&rsquo; duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Put down his name, Mr. Jinks,&rsquo; said the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two L&rsquo;s, old feller,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here an unfortunate special laughed again, whereupon the magistrate
      threatened to commit him instantly. It is a dangerous thing to laugh at
      the wrong man, in these cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where do you live?&rsquo; said the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vere ever I can,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Put down that, Mr. Jinks,&rsquo; said the magistrate, who was fast rising into
      a rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Score it under,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a vagabond, Mr. Jinks,&rsquo; said the magistrate. &lsquo;He is a vagabond on
      his own statement,&mdash;is he not, Mr. Jinks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll commit him&mdash;I&rsquo;ll commit him as such,&rsquo; said Mr. Nupkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is a wery impartial country for justice, &lsquo;said Sam.&rsquo; There ain&rsquo;t a
      magistrate goin&rsquo; as don&rsquo;t commit himself twice as he commits other
      people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this sally another special laughed, and then tried to look so
      supernaturally solemn, that the magistrate detected him immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grummer,&rsquo; said Mr. Nupkins, reddening with passion, &lsquo;how dare you select
      such an inefficient and disreputable person for a special constable, as
      that man? How dare you do it, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very sorry, your Wash-up,&rsquo; stammered Grummer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very sorry!&rsquo; said the furious magistrate. &lsquo;You shall repent of this
      neglect of duty, Mr. Grummer; you shall be made an example of. Take that
      fellow&rsquo;s staff away. He&rsquo;s drunk. You&rsquo;re drunk, fellow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not drunk, your Worship,&rsquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You <i>are </i>drunk,&rsquo; returned the magistrate. &lsquo;How dare you say you are
      not drunk, Sir, when I say you are? Doesn&rsquo;t he smell of spirits, Grummer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Horrid, your Wash-up,&rsquo; replied Grummer, who had a vague impression that
      there was a smell of rum somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew he did,&rsquo; said Mr. Nupkins. &lsquo;I saw he was drunk when he first came
      into the room, by his excited eye. Did you observe his excited eye, Mr.
      Jinks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t touched a drop of spirits this morning,&rsquo; said the man, who was
      as sober a fellow as need be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How dare you tell me a falsehood?&rsquo; said Mr. Nupkins. &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t he drunk at
      this moment, Mr. Jinks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, Sir,&rsquo; replied Jinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Jinks,&rsquo; said the magistrate, &lsquo;I shall commit that man for contempt.
      Make out his committal, Mr. Jinks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And committed the special would have been, only Jinks, who was the
      magistrate&rsquo;s adviser (having had a legal education of three years in a
      country attorney&rsquo;s office), whispered the magistrate that he thought it
      wouldn&rsquo;t do; so the magistrate made a speech, and said, that in
      consideration of the special&rsquo;s family, he would merely reprimand and
      discharge him. Accordingly, the special was abused, vehemently, for a
      quarter of an hour, and sent about his business; and Grummer, Dubbley,
      Muzzle, and all the other specials, murmured their admiration of the
      magnanimity of Mr. Nupkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Mr. Jinks,&rsquo; said the magistrate, &lsquo;swear Grummer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Grummer was sworn directly; but as Grummer wandered, and Mr. Nupkins&rsquo;s
      dinner was nearly ready, Mr. Nupkins cut the matter short, by putting
      leading questions to Grummer, which Grummer answered as nearly in the
      affirmative as he could. So the examination went off, all very smooth and
      comfortable, and two assaults were proved against Mr. Weller, and a threat
      against Mr. Winkle, and a push against Mr. Snodgrass. When all this was
      done to the magistrate&rsquo;s satisfaction, the magistrate and Mr. Jinks
      consulted in whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consultation having lasted about ten minutes, Mr. Jinks retired to his
      end of the table; and the magistrate, with a preparatory cough, drew
      himself up in his chair, and was proceeding to commence his address, when
      Mr. Pickwick interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir, for interrupting you,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;but
      before you proceed to express, and act upon, any opinion you may have
      formed on the statements which have been made here, I must claim my right
      to be heard so far as I am personally concerned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your tongue, Sir,&rsquo; said the magistrate peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must submit to you, Sir&mdash;&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your tongue, sir,&rsquo; interposed the magistrate, &lsquo;or I shall order an
      officer to remove you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may order your officers to do whatever you please, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Pickwick; &lsquo;and I have no doubt, from the specimen I have had of the
      subordination preserved amongst them, that whatever you order, they will
      execute, Sir; but I shall take the liberty, Sir, of claiming my right to
      be heard, until I am removed by force.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pickvick and principle!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Weller, in a very audible voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam, be quiet,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dumb as a drum vith a hole in it, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nupkins looked at Mr. Pickwick with a gaze of intense astonishment, at
      his displaying such unwonted temerity; and was apparently about to return
      a very angry reply, when Mr. Jinks pulled him by the sleeve, and whispered
      something in his ear. To this, the magistrate returned a half-audible
      answer, and then the whispering was renewed. Jinks was evidently
      remonstrating.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the magistrate, gulping down, with a very bad grace, his
      disinclination to hear anything more, turned to Mr. Pickwick, and said
      sharply, &lsquo;What do you want to say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;First,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, sending a look through his spectacles, under
      which even Nupkins quailed, &lsquo;first, I wish to know what I and my friend
      have been brought here for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Must I tell him?&rsquo; whispered the magistrate to Jinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you had better, sir,&rsquo; whispered Jinks to the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An information has been sworn before me,&rsquo; said the magistrate, &lsquo;that it
      is apprehended you are going to fight a duel, and that the other man,
      Tupman, is your aider and abettor in it. Therefore&mdash;eh, Mr. Jinks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Therefore, I call upon you both, to&mdash;I think that&rsquo;s the course, Mr.
      Jinks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To&mdash;to&mdash;what, Mr. Jinks?&rsquo; said the magistrate pettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To find bail, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Therefore, I call upon you both&mdash;as I was about to say when I
      was interrupted by my clerk&mdash;to find bail.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Good bail,&rsquo; whispered Mr. Jinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall require good bail,&rsquo; said the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Town&rsquo;s-people,&rsquo; whispered Jinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They must be townspeople,&rsquo; said the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fifty pounds each,&rsquo; whispered Jinks, &lsquo;and householders, of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall require two sureties of fifty pounds each,&rsquo; said the magistrate
      aloud, with great dignity, &lsquo;and they must be householders, of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But bless my heart, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, who, together with Mr.
      Tupman, was all amazement and indignation; &lsquo;we are perfect strangers in
      this town. I have as little knowledge of any householders here, as I have
      intention of fighting a duel with anybody.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say,&rsquo; replied the magistrate, &lsquo;I dare say&mdash;don&rsquo;t you, Mr.
      Jinks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you anything more to say?&rsquo; inquired the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick had a great deal more to say, which he would no doubt have
      said, very little to his own advantage, or the magistrate&rsquo;s satisfaction,
      if he had not, the moment he ceased speaking, been pulled by the sleeve by
      Mr. Weller, with whom he was immediately engaged in so earnest a
      conversation, that he suffered the magistrate&rsquo;s inquiry to pass wholly
      unnoticed. Mr. Nupkins was not the man to ask a question of the kind twice
      over; and so, with another preparatory cough, he proceeded, amidst the
      reverential and admiring silence of the constables, to pronounce his
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      He should fine Weller two pounds for the first assault, and three pounds
      for the second. He should fine Winkle two pounds, and Snodgrass one pound,
      besides requiring them to enter into their own recognisances to keep the
      peace towards all his Majesty&rsquo;s subjects, and especially towards his liege
      servant, Daniel Grummer. Pickwick and Tupman he had already held to bail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately on the magistrate ceasing to speak, Mr. Pickwick, with a smile
      mantling on his again good-humoured countenance, stepped forward, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg the magistrate&rsquo;s pardon, but may I request a few minutes&rsquo; private
      conversation with him, on a matter of deep importance to himself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; said the magistrate. Mr. Pickwick repeated his request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is a most extraordinary request,&rsquo; said the magistrate. &lsquo;A private
      interview?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A private interview,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick firmly; &lsquo;only, as a part of
      the information which I wish to communicate is derived from my servant, I
      should wish him to be present.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The magistrate looked at Mr. Jinks; Mr. Jinks looked at the magistrate;
      the officers looked at each other in amazement. Mr. Nupkins turned
      suddenly pale. Could the man Weller, in a moment of remorse, have divulged
      some secret conspiracy for his assassination? It was a dreadful thought.
      He was a public man; and he turned paler, as he thought of Julius Caesar
      and Mr. Perceval.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magistrate looked at Mr. Pickwick again, and beckoned Mr. Jinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think of this request, Mr. Jinks?&rsquo; murmured Mr. Nupkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jinks, who didn&rsquo;t exactly know what to think of it, and was afraid he
      might offend, smiled feebly, after a dubious fashion, and, screwing up the
      corners of his mouth, shook his head slowly from side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Jinks,&rsquo; said the magistrate gravely, &lsquo;you are an ass.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this little expression of opinion, Mr. Jinks smiled again&mdash;rather
      more feebly than before&mdash;and edged himself, by degrees, back into his
      own corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nupkins debated the matter within himself for a few seconds, and then,
      rising from his chair, and requesting Mr. Pickwick and Sam to follow him,
      led the way into a small room which opened into the justice-parlour.
      Desiring Mr. Pickwick to walk to the upper end of the little apartment,
      and holding his hand upon the half-closed door, that he might be able to
      effect an immediate escape, in case there was the least tendency to a
      display of hostilities, Mr. Nupkins expressed his readiness to hear the
      communication, whatever it might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will come to the point at once, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;it affects
      yourself and your credit materially. I have every reason to believe, Sir,
      that you are harbouring in your house a gross impostor!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two,&rsquo; interrupted Sam. &lsquo;Mulberry agin all natur, for tears and
      willainny!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;if I am to render myself intelligible to this
      gentleman, I must beg you to control your feelings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery sorry, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; &lsquo;but when I think o&rsquo; that &lsquo;ere Job,
      I can&rsquo;t help opening the walve a inch or two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In one word, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;is my servant right in suspecting
      that a certain Captain Fitz-Marshall is in the habit of visiting here?
      Because,&rsquo; added Mr. Pickwick, as he saw that Mr. Nupkins was about to
      offer a very indignant interruption, &lsquo;because if he be, I know that person
      to be a&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, hush,&rsquo; said Mr. Nupkins, closing the door. &lsquo;Know him to be what,
      Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An unprincipled adventurer&mdash;a dishonourable character&mdash;a man
      who preys upon society, and makes easily-deceived people his dupes, Sir;
      his absurd, his foolish, his wretched dupes, Sir,&rsquo; said the excited Mr.
      Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said Mr. Nupkins, turning very red, and altering his whole
      manner directly. &lsquo;Dear me, Mr.&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pickvick,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pickwick,&rsquo; said the magistrate, &lsquo;dear me, Mr. Pickwick&mdash;pray take a
      seat&mdash;you cannot mean this? Captain Fitz-Marshall!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t call him a cap&rsquo;en,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;nor Fitz-Marshall neither; he ain&rsquo;t
      neither one nor t&rsquo;other. He&rsquo;s a strolling actor, he is, and his name&rsquo;s
      Jingle; and if ever there was a wolf in a mulberry suit, that &lsquo;ere Job
      Trotter&rsquo;s him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very true, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, replying to the magistrate&rsquo;s
      look of amazement; &lsquo;my only business in this town, is to expose the person
      of whom we now speak.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick proceeded to pour into the horror-stricken ear of Mr.
      Nupkins, an abridged account of all Mr. Jingle&rsquo;s atrocities. He related
      how he had first met him; how he had eloped with Miss Wardle; how he had
      cheerfully resigned the lady for a pecuniary consideration; how he had
      entrapped himself into a lady&rsquo;s boarding-school at midnight; and how he
      (Mr. Pickwick) now felt it his duty to expose his assumption of his
      present name and rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the narrative proceeded, all the warm blood in the body of Mr. Nupkins
      tingled up into the very tips of his ears. He had picked up the captain at
      a neighbouring race-course. Charmed with his long list of aristocratic
      acquaintance, his extensive travel, and his fashionable demeanour, Mrs.
      Nupkins and Miss Nupkins had exhibited Captain Fitz-Marshall, and quoted
      Captain Fitz-Marshall, and hurled Captain Fitz-Marshall at the devoted
      heads of their select circle of acquaintance, until their bosom friends,
      Mrs. Porkenham and the Misses Porkenhams, and Mr. Sidney Porkenham, were
      ready to burst with jealousy and despair. And now, to hear, after all,
      that he was a needy adventurer, a strolling player, and if not a swindler,
      something so very like it, that it was hard to tell the difference!
      Heavens! what would the Porkenhams say! What would be the triumph of Mr.
      Sidney Porkenham when he found that his addresses had been slighted for
      such a rival! How should he, Nupkins, meet the eye of old Porkenham at the
      next quarter-sessions! And what a handle would it be for the opposition
      magisterial party if the story got abroad!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But after all,&rsquo; said Mr. Nupkins, brightening for a moment, after a long
      pause; &lsquo;after all, this is a mere statement. Captain Fitz-Marshall is a
      man of very engaging manners, and, I dare say, has many enemies. What
      proof have you of the truth of these representations?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Confront me with him,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;that is all I ask, and all I
      require. Confront him with me and my friends here; you will want no
      further proof.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said Mr. Nupkins, &lsquo;that might be very easily done, for he will be
      here to-night, and then there would be no occasion to make the matter
      public, just&mdash;just&mdash;for the young man&rsquo;s own sake, you know. I&mdash;I&mdash;should
      like to consult Mrs. Nupkins on the propriety of the step, in the first
      instance, though. At all events, Mr. Pickwick, we must despatch this legal
      business before we can do anything else. Pray step back into the next
      room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the next room they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grummer,&rsquo; said the magistrate, in an awful voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Wash-up,&rsquo; replied Grummer, with the smile of a favourite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come, Sir,&rsquo; said the magistrate sternly, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t let me see any of
      this levity here. It is very unbecoming, and I can assure you that you
      have very little to smile at. Was the account you gave me just now
      strictly true? Now be careful, sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Your Wash-up,&rsquo; stammered Grummer, &lsquo;I-&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you are confused, are you?&rsquo; said the magistrate. &lsquo;Mr. Jinks, you
      observe this confusion?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, Sir,&rsquo; replied Jinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the magistrate, &lsquo;repeat your statement, Grummer, and again I
      warn you to be careful. Mr. Jinks, take his words down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate Grummer proceeded to re-state his complaint, but, what
      between Mr. Jinks&rsquo;s taking down his words, and the magistrate&rsquo;s taking
      them up, his natural tendency to rambling, and his extreme confusion, he
      managed to get involved, in something under three minutes, in such a mass
      of entanglement and contradiction, that Mr. Nupkins at once declared he
      didn&rsquo;t believe him. So the fines were remitted, and Mr. Jinks found a
      couple of bail in no time. And all these solemn proceedings having been
      satisfactorily concluded, Mr. Grummer was ignominiously ordered out&mdash;an
      awful instance of the instability of human greatness, and the uncertain
      tenure of great men&rsquo;s favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Nupkins was a majestic female in a pink gauze turban and a light
      brown wig. Miss Nupkins possessed all her mamma&rsquo;s haughtiness without the
      turban, and all her ill-nature without the wig; and whenever the exercise
      of these two amiable qualities involved mother and daughter in some
      unpleasant dilemma, as they not infrequently did, they both concurred in
      laying the blame on the shoulders of Mr. Nupkins. Accordingly, when Mr.
      Nupkins sought Mrs. Nupkins, and detailed the communication which had been
      made by Mr. Pickwick, Mrs. Nupkins suddenly recollected that she had
      always expected something of the kind; that she had always said it would
      be so; that her advice was never taken; that she really did not know what
      Mr. Nupkins supposed she was; and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The idea!&rsquo; said Miss Nupkins, forcing a tear of very scanty proportions
      into the corner of each eye; &lsquo;the idea of my being made such a fool of!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you may thank your papa, my dear,&rsquo; said Mrs. Nupkins; &lsquo;how I have
      implored and begged that man to inquire into the captain&rsquo;s family
      connections; how I have urged and entreated him to take some decisive
      step! I am quite certain nobody would believe it&mdash;quite.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, my dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Nupkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me, you aggravating thing, don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; said Mrs. Nupkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My love,&rsquo; said Mr. Nupkins, &lsquo;you professed yourself very fond of Captain
      Fitz-Marshall. You have constantly asked him here, my dear, and you have
      lost no opportunity of introducing him elsewhere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say so, Henrietta?&rsquo; cried Mrs. Nupkins, appealing to her
      daughter with the air of a much-injured female. &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say that your
      papa would turn round and lay all this at my door? Didn&rsquo;t I say so?&rsquo; Here
      Mrs. Nupkins sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, pa!&rsquo; remonstrated Miss Nupkins. And here she sobbed too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it too much, when he has brought all this disgrace and ridicule
      upon us, to taunt me with being the cause of it?&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Nupkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can we ever show ourselves in society!&rsquo; said Miss Nupkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can we face the Porkenhams?&rsquo; cried Mrs. Nupkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or the Griggs!&rsquo; cried Miss Nupkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or the Slummintowkens!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Nupkins. &lsquo;But what does your papa
      care! What is it to <i>him</i>!&rsquo; At this dreadful reflection, Mrs. Nupkins
      wept mental anguish, and Miss Nupkins followed on the same side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Nupkins&rsquo;s tears continued to gush forth, with great velocity, until
      she had gained a little time to think the matter over; when she decided,
      in her own mind, that the best thing to do would be to ask Mr. Pickwick
      and his friends to remain until the captain&rsquo;s arrival, and then to give
      Mr. Pickwick the opportunity he sought. If it appeared that he had spoken
      truly, the captain could be turned out of the house without noising the
      matter abroad, and they could easily account to the Porkenhams for his
      disappearance, by saying that he had been appointed, through the Court
      influence of his family, to the governor-generalship of Sierra Leone, of
      Saugur Point, or any other of those salubrious climates which enchant
      Europeans so much, that when they once get there, they can hardly ever
      prevail upon themselves to come back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Nupkins dried up her tears, Miss Nupkins dried up hers, and Mr.
      Nupkins was very glad to settle the matter as Mrs. Nupkins had proposed.
      So Mr. Pickwick and his friends, having washed off all marks of their late
      encounter, were introduced to the ladies, and soon afterwards to their
      dinner; and Mr. Weller, whom the magistrate, with his peculiar sagacity,
      had discovered in half an hour to be one of the finest fellows alive, was
      consigned to the care and guardianship of Mr. Muzzle, who was specially
      enjoined to take him below, and make much of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How de do, sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Muzzle, as he conducted Mr. Weller down the
      kitchen stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, no considerable change has taken place in the state of my system,
      since I see you cocked up behind your governor&rsquo;s chair in the parlour, a
      little vile ago,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will excuse my not taking more notice of you then,&rsquo; said Mr. Muzzle.
      &lsquo;You see, master hadn&rsquo;t introduced us, then. Lord, how fond he is of you,
      Mr. Weller, to be sure!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;what a pleasant chap he is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; replied Mr. Muzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So much humour,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And such a man to speak,&rsquo; said Mr. Muzzle. &lsquo;How his ideas flow, don&rsquo;t
      they?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wonderful,&rsquo; replied Sam; &lsquo;they comes a-pouring out, knocking each other&rsquo;s
      heads so fast, that they seems to stun one another; you hardly know what
      he&rsquo;s arter, do you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That&rsquo;s the great merit of his style of speaking,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Muzzle.
      &lsquo;Take care of the last step, Mr. Weller. Would you like to wash your
      hands, sir, before we join the ladies? Here&rsquo;s a sink, with the water laid
      on, Sir, and a clean jack towel behind the door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! perhaps I may as well have a rinse,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, applying
      plenty of yellow soap to the towel, and rubbing away till his face shone
      again. &lsquo;How many ladies are there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only two in our kitchen,&rsquo; said Mr. Muzzle; &lsquo;cook and &lsquo;ouse-maid. We keep
      a boy to do the dirty work, and a gal besides, but they dine in the
      wash&rsquo;us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, they dines in the wash&rsquo;us, do they?&rsquo; said Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Mr. Muzzle, &lsquo;we tried &lsquo;em at our table when they first
      come, but we couldn&rsquo;t keep &lsquo;em. The gal&rsquo;s manners is dreadful vulgar; and
      the boy breathes so very hard while he&rsquo;s eating, that we found it
      impossible to sit at table with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Young grampus!&rsquo; said Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, dreadful,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Muzzle; &lsquo;but that is the worst of country
      service, Mr. Weller; the juniors is always so very savage. This way, sir,
      if you please, this way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Preceding Mr. Weller, with the utmost politeness, Mr. Muzzle conducted him
      into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mary,&rsquo; said Mr. Muzzle to the pretty servant-girl, &lsquo;this is Mr. Weller; a
      gentleman as master has sent down, to be made as comfortable as possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And your master&rsquo;s a knowin&rsquo; hand, and has just sent me to the right
      place,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, with a glance of admiration at Mary. &lsquo;If I wos
      master o&rsquo; this here house, I should alvays find the materials for comfort
      vere Mary wos.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lor, Mr. Weller!&rsquo; said Mary blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I never!&rsquo; ejaculated the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless me, cook, I forgot you,&rsquo; said Mr. Muzzle. &lsquo;Mr. Weller, let me
      introduce you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How are you, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; said Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Wery glad to see you, indeed, and
      hope our acquaintance may be a long &lsquo;un, as the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n said to the fi&rsquo; 
      pun&rsquo; note.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When this ceremony of introduction had been gone through, the cook and
      Mary retired into the back kitchen to titter, for ten minutes; then
      returning, all giggles and blushes, they sat down to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller&rsquo;s easy manners and conversational powers had such irresistible
      influence with his new friends, that before the dinner was half over, they
      were on a footing of perfect intimacy, and in possession of a full account
      of the delinquency of Job Trotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never could a-bear that Job,&rsquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more you never ought to, my dear,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; inquired Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Cos ugliness and svindlin&rsquo; never ought to be formiliar with elegance and
      wirtew,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Ought they, Mr. Muzzle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not by no means,&rsquo; replied that gentleman.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/0486m.jpg" alt="0486m " /><br />

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0486.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Here Mary laughed, and said the cook had made her; and the cook laughed,
      and said she hadn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got a glass,&rsquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drink with me, my dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Put your lips to this here
      tumbler, and then I can kiss you by deputy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For shame, Mr. Weller!&rsquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s a shame, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Talkin&rsquo; in that way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense; it ain&rsquo;t no harm. It&rsquo;s natur; ain&rsquo;t it, cook?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me, imperence,&rsquo; replied the cook, in a high state of delight;
      and hereupon the cook and Mary laughed again, till what between the beer,
      and the cold meat, and the laughter combined, the latter young lady was
      brought to the verge of choking&mdash;an alarming crisis from which she
      was only recovered by sundry pats on the back, and other necessary
      attentions, most delicately administered by Mr. Samuel Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of all this jollity and conviviality, a loud ring was heard
      at the garden gate, to which the young gentleman who took his meals in the
      wash-house, immediately responded. Mr. Weller was in the height of his
      attentions to the pretty house-maid; Mr. Muzzle was busy doing the honours
      of the table; and the cook had just paused to laugh, in the very act of
      raising a huge morsel to her lips; when the kitchen door opened, and in
      walked Mr. Job Trotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have said in walked Mr. Job Trotter, but the statement is not
      distinguished by our usual scrupulous adherence to fact. The door opened
      and Mr. Trotter appeared. He would have walked in, and was in the very act
      of doing so, indeed, when catching sight of Mr. Weller, he involuntarily
      shrank back a pace or two, and stood gazing on the unexpected scene before
      him, perfectly motionless with amazement and terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here he is!&rsquo; said Sam, rising with great glee. &lsquo;Why we were that wery
      moment a-speaking o&rsquo; you. How are you? Where have you been? Come in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Laying his hand on the mulberry collar of the unresisting Job, Mr. Weller
      dragged him into the kitchen; and, locking the door, handed the key to Mr.
      Muzzle, who very coolly buttoned it up in a side pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, here&rsquo;s a game!&rsquo; cried Sam. &lsquo;Only think o&rsquo; my master havin&rsquo; the
      pleasure o&rsquo; meeting yourn upstairs, and me havin&rsquo; the joy o&rsquo; meetin&rsquo; you
      down here. How are you gettin&rsquo; on, and how is the chandlery bis&rsquo;ness
      likely to do? Well, I am so glad to see you. How happy you look. It&rsquo;s
      quite a treat to see you; ain&rsquo;t it, Mr. Muzzle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite,&rsquo; said Mr. Muzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So cheerful he is!&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In such good spirits!&rsquo; said Muzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so glad to see us&mdash;that makes it so much more comfortable,&rsquo; said
      Sam. &lsquo;Sit down; sit down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Trotter suffered himself to be forced into a chair by the fireside. He
      cast his small eyes, first on Mr. Weller, and then on Mr. Muzzle, but said
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, now,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;afore these here ladies, I should jest like to ask
      you, as a sort of curiosity, whether you don&rsquo;t consider yourself as nice
      and well-behaved a young gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, as ever used a pink check
      pocket-handkerchief, and the number four collection?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And as was ever a-going to be married to a cook,&rsquo; said that lady
      indignantly. &lsquo;The willin!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And leave off his evil ways, and set up in the chandlery line
      arterwards,&rsquo; said the housemaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, young man,&rsquo; said Mr. Muzzle solemnly,
      enraged at the last two allusions, &lsquo;this here lady (pointing to the cook)
      keeps company with me; and when you presume, Sir, to talk of keeping
      chandlers&rsquo; shops with her, you injure me in one of the most delicatest
      points in which one man can injure another. Do you understand that, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Muzzle, who had a great notion of his eloquence, in which he
      imitated his master, paused for a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Trotter made no reply. So Mr. Muzzle proceeded in a solemn manner&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very probable, sir, that you won&rsquo;t be wanted upstairs for several
      minutes, Sir, because <i>my</i> master is at this moment particularly
      engaged in settling the hash of <i>your </i>master, Sir; and therefore
      you&rsquo;ll have leisure, Sir, for a little private talk with me, Sir. Do you
      understand that, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Muzzle again paused for a reply; and again Mr. Trotter disappointed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said Mr. Muzzle, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry to have to explain myself
      before ladies, but the urgency of the case will be my excuse. The back
      kitchen&rsquo;s empty, Sir. If you will step in there, Sir, Mr. Weller will see
      fair, and we can have mutual satisfaction till the bell rings. Follow me,
      Sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Muzzle uttered these words, he took a step or two towards the door;
      and, by way of saving time, began to pull off his coat as he walked along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the cook no sooner heard the concluding words of this desperate
      challenge, and saw Mr. Muzzle about to put it into execution, than she
      uttered a loud and piercing shriek; and rushing on Mr. Job Trotter, who
      rose from his chair on the instant, tore and buffeted his large flat face,
      with an energy peculiar to excited females, and twining her hands in his
      long black hair, tore therefrom about enough to make five or six dozen of
      the very largest-sized mourning-rings. Having accomplished this feat with
      all the ardour which her devoted love for Mr. Muzzle inspired, she
      staggered back; and being a lady of very excitable and delicate feelings,
      she instantly fell under the dresser, and fainted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, the bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s for you, Job Trotter,&rsquo; said Sam; and before Mr. Trotter could
      offer remonstrance or reply&mdash;even before he had time to stanch the
      wounds inflicted by the insensible lady&mdash;Sam seized one arm and Mr.
      Muzzle the other, and one pulling before, and the other pushing behind,
      they conveyed him upstairs, and into the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an impressive tableau. Alfred Jingle, Esquire, alias Captain
      Fitz-Marshall, was standing near the door with his hat in his hand, and a
      smile on his face, wholly unmoved by his very unpleasant situation.
      Confronting him, stood Mr. Pickwick, who had evidently been inculcating
      some high moral lesson; for his left hand was beneath his coat tail, and
      his right extended in air, as was his wont when delivering himself of an
      impressive address. At a little distance, stood Mr. Tupman with indignant
      countenance, carefully held back by his two younger friends; at the
      farther end of the room were Mr. Nupkins, Mrs. Nupkins, and Miss Nupkins,
      gloomily grand and savagely vexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What prevents me,&rsquo; said Mr. Nupkins, with magisterial dignity, as Job was
      brought in&mdash;&lsquo;what prevents me from detaining these men as rogues and
      impostors? It is a foolish mercy. What prevents me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pride, old fellow, pride,&rsquo; replied Jingle, quite at his ease. &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t
      do&mdash;no go&mdash;caught a captain, eh?&mdash;ha! ha! very good&mdash;husband
      for daughter&mdash;biter bit&mdash;make it public&mdash;not for worlds&mdash;look
      stupid&mdash;very!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wretch,&rsquo; said Mr. Nupkins, &lsquo;we scorn your base insinuations.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I always hated him,&rsquo; added Henrietta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, of course,&rsquo; said Jingle. &lsquo;Tall young man&mdash;old lover&mdash;Sidney
      Porkenham&mdash;rich&mdash;fine fellow&mdash;not so rich as captain,
      though, eh?&mdash;turn him away&mdash;off with him&mdash;anything for
      captain&mdash;nothing like captain anywhere&mdash;all the girls&mdash;raving
      mad&mdash;eh, Job, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Jingle laughed very heartily; and Job, rubbing his hands with
      delight, uttered the first sound he had given vent to since he entered the
      house&mdash;a low, noiseless chuckle, which seemed to intimate that he
      enjoyed his laugh too much, to let any of it escape in sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Nupkins,&rsquo; said the elder lady,&rsquo; this is not a fit conversation for
      the servants to overhear. Let these wretches be removed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, my dear,&rsquo; Said Mr. Nupkins. &lsquo;Muzzle!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Worship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Open the front door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, your Worship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave the house!&rsquo; said Mr. Nupkins, waving his hand emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jingle smiled, and moved towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. Jingle stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I might,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;have taken a much greater revenge for the
      treatment I have experienced at your hands, and that of your hypocritical
      friend there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Job Trotter bowed with great politeness, and laid his hand upon his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, growing gradually angry, &lsquo;that I might have
      taken a greater revenge, but I content myself with exposing you, which I
      consider a duty I owe to society. This is a leniency, Sir, which I hope
      you will remember.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Pickwick arrived at this point, Job Trotter, with facetious
      gravity, applied his hand to his ear, as if desirous not to lose a
      syllable he uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I have only to add, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, now thoroughly angry,
      &lsquo;that I consider you a rascal, and a&mdash;a&mdash;ruffian&mdash;and&mdash;and
      worse than any man I ever saw, or heard of, except that pious and
      sanctified vagabond in the mulberry livery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! ha!&rsquo; said Jingle, &lsquo;good fellow, Pickwick&mdash;fine heart&mdash;stout
      old boy&mdash;but must <i>not </i>be passionate&mdash;bad thing, very&mdash;bye,
      bye&mdash;see you again some day&mdash;keep up your spirits&mdash;now, Job&mdash;trot!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Mr. Jingle stuck on his hat in his old fashion, and
      strode out of the room. Job Trotter paused, looked round, smiled and then
      with a bow of mock solemnity to Mr. Pickwick, and a wink to Mr. Weller,
      the audacious slyness of which baffles all description, followed the
      footsteps of his hopeful master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as Mr. Weller was following.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller seemed uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay here,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I polish that &lsquo;ere Job off, in the front garden?&rsquo; said Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I kick him out o&rsquo; the gate, Sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not on any account,&rsquo; replied his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time since his engagement, Mr. Weller looked, for a moment,
      discontented and unhappy. But his countenance immediately cleared up; for
      the wily Mr. Muzzle, by concealing himself behind the street door, and
      rushing violently out, at the right instant, contrived with great
      dexterity to overturn both Mr. Jingle and his attendant, down the flight
      of steps, into the American aloe tubs that stood beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Having discharged my duty, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick to Mr. Nupkins, &lsquo;I
      will, with my friends, bid you farewell. While we thank you for such
      hospitality as we have received, permit me to assure you, in our joint
      names, that we should not have accepted it, or have consented to extricate
      ourselves in this way, from our previous dilemma, had we not been impelled
      by a strong sense of duty. We return to London to-morrow. Your secret is
      safe with us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus entered his protest against their treatment of the morning,
      Mr. Pickwick bowed low to the ladies, and notwithstanding the
      solicitations of the family, left the room with his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get your hat, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s below stairs, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam, and he ran down after it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, there was nobody in the kitchen, but the pretty housemaid; and as
      Sam&rsquo;s hat was mislaid, he had to look for it, and the pretty housemaid
      lighted him. They had to look all over the place for the hat. The pretty
      housemaid, in her anxiety to find it, went down on her knees, and turned
      over all the things that were heaped together in a little corner by the
      door. It was an awkward corner. You couldn&rsquo;t get at it without shutting
      the door first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here it is,&rsquo; said the pretty housemaid. &lsquo;This is it, ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me look,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pretty housemaid had stood the candle on the floor; and, as it gave a
      very dim light, Sam was obliged to go down on <i>his </i>knees before he
      could see whether it really was his own hat or not. It was a remarkably
      small corner, and so&mdash;it was nobody&rsquo;s fault but the man&rsquo;s who built
      the house&mdash;Sam and the pretty housemaid were necessarily very close
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, this is it,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;Good-bye!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye!&rsquo; said the pretty housemaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye!&rsquo; said Sam; and as he said it, he dropped the hat that had cost
      so much trouble in looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How awkward you are,&rsquo; said the pretty housemaid. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll lose it again,
      if you don&rsquo;t take care.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So just to prevent his losing it again, she put it on for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it was that the pretty housemaid&rsquo;s face looked prettier still,
      when it was raised towards Sam&rsquo;s, or whether it was the accidental
      consequence of their being so near to each other, is matter of uncertainty
      to this day; but Sam kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you did that on purpose,&rsquo; said the pretty
      housemaid, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t then,&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;but I will now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So he kissed her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, calling over the banisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Coming, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam, running upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long you have been!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was something behind the door, Sir, which perwented our getting it
      open, for ever so long, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was the first passage of Mr. Weller&rsquo;s first love.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. WHICH CONTAINS A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE PROGRESS OF THE ACTION
      OF BARDELL AGAINST PICKWICK
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>aving accomplished
      the main end and object of his journey, by the exposure of Jingle, Mr.
      Pickwick resolved on immediately returning to London, with the view of
      becoming acquainted with the proceedings which had been taken against him,
      in the meantime, by Messrs. Dodson and Fogg. Acting upon this resolution
      with all the energy and decision of his character, he mounted to the back
      seat of the first coach which left Ipswich on the morning after the
      memorable occurrences detailed at length in the two preceding chapters;
      and accompanied by his three friends, and Mr. Samuel Weller, arrived in
      the metropolis, in perfect health and safety, the same evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the friends, for a short time, separated. Messrs. Tupman, Winkle, and
      Snodgrass repaired to their several homes to make such preparations as
      might be requisite for their forthcoming visit to Dingley Dell; and Mr.
      Pickwick and Sam took up their present abode in very good, old-fashioned,
      and comfortable quarters, to wit, the George and Vulture Tavern and Hotel,
      George Yard, Lombard Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick had dined, finished his second pint of particular port,
      pulled his silk handkerchief over his head, put his feet on the fender,
      and thrown himself back in an easy-chair, when the entrance of Mr. Weller
      with his carpet-bag, aroused him from his tranquil meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have just been thinking, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;that having left a
      good many things at Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s, in Goswell Street, I ought to arrange
      for taking them away, before I leave town again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could send them to Mr. Tupman&rsquo;s, for the present, Sam,&rsquo; continued Mr.
      Pickwick, &lsquo;but before we take them away, it is necessary that they should
      be looked up, and put together. I wish you would step up to Goswell
      Street, Sam, and arrange about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At once, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At once,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;And stay, Sam,&rsquo; added Mr. Pickwick,
      pulling out his purse, &lsquo;there is some rent to pay. The quarter is not due
      till Christmas, but you may pay it, and have done with it. A month&rsquo;s
      notice terminates my tenancy. Here it is, written out. Give it, and tell
      Mrs. Bardell she may put a bill up, as soon as she likes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; &lsquo;anythin&rsquo; more, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing more, Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller stepped slowly to the door, as if he expected something more;
      slowly opened it, slowly stepped out, and had slowly closed it within a
      couple of inches, when Mr. Pickwick called out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, stepping quickly back, and closing the door
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no objection, Sam, to your endeavouring to ascertain how Mrs.
      Bardell herself seems disposed towards me, and whether it is really
      probable that this vile and groundless action is to be carried to
      extremity. I say I do not object to you doing this, if you wish it, Sam,&rsquo; 
      said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam gave a short nod of intelligence, and left the room. Mr. Pickwick drew
      the silk handkerchief once more over his head, And composed himself for a
      nap. Mr. Weller promptly walked forth, to execute his commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly nine o&rsquo;clock when he reached Goswell Street. A couple of
      candles were burning in the little front parlour, and a couple of caps
      were reflected on the window-blind. Mrs. Bardell had got company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller knocked at the door, and after a pretty long interval&mdash;occupied
      by the party without, in whistling a tune, and by the party within, in
      persuading a refractory flat candle to allow itself to be lighted&mdash;a
      pair of small boots pattered over the floor-cloth, and Master Bardell
      presented himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, young townskip,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;how&rsquo;s mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s pretty well,&rsquo; replied Master Bardell, &lsquo;so am I.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a mercy,&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;tell her I want to speak to her, will
      you, my hinfant fernomenon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Bardell, thus adjured, placed the refractory flat candle on the
      bottom stair, and vanished into the front parlour with his message.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two caps, reflected on the window-blind, were the respective
      head-dresses of a couple of Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s most particular acquaintance,
      who had just stepped in, to have a quiet cup of tea, and a little warm
      supper of a couple of sets of pettitoes and some toasted cheese. The
      cheese was simmering and browning away, most delightfully, in a little
      Dutch oven before the fire; the pettitoes were getting on deliciously in a
      little tin saucepan on the hob; and Mrs. Bardell and her two friends were
      getting on very well, also, in a little quiet conversation about and
      concerning all their particular friends and acquaintance; when Master
      Bardell came back from answering the door, and delivered the message
      intrusted to him by Mr. Samuel Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s servant!&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell, turning pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless my soul!&rsquo; said Mrs. Cluppins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I raly would not ha&rsquo; believed it, unless I had ha&rsquo; happened to ha&rsquo; 
      been here!&rsquo; said Mrs. Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cluppins was a little, brisk, busy-looking woman; Mrs. Sanders was a
      big, fat, heavy-faced personage; and the two were the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bardell felt it proper to be agitated; and as none of the three
      exactly knew whether under existing circumstances, any communication,
      otherwise than through Dodson &amp; Fogg, ought to be held with Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s servant, they were all rather taken by surprise. In this state
      of indecision, obviously the first thing to be done, was to thump the boy
      for finding Mr. Weller at the door. So his mother thumped him, and he
      cried melodiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your noise&mdash;do&mdash;you naughty creetur!&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; don&rsquo;t worrit your poor mother,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s quite enough to worrit her, as it is, without you, Tommy,&rsquo; said
      Mrs. Cluppins, with sympathising resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! worse luck, poor lamb!&rsquo; said Mrs. Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all which moral reflections, Master Bardell howled the louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, what shall I do?&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell to Mrs. Cluppins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you ought to see him,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Cluppins. &lsquo;But on no account
      without a witness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think two witnesses would be more lawful,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sanders, who, like
      the other friend, was bursting with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;d better come in here,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Cluppins, eagerly catching at the idea; &lsquo;walk
      in, young man; and shut the street door first, please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller immediately took the hint; and presenting himself in the
      parlour, explained his business to Mrs. Bardell thus&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery sorry to &lsquo;casion any personal inconwenience, ma&rsquo;am, as the
      housebreaker said to the old lady when he put her on the fire; but as me
      and my governor &lsquo;s only jest come to town, and is jest going away agin, it
      can&rsquo;t be helped, you see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, the young man can&rsquo;t help the faults of his master,&rsquo; said Mrs.
      Cluppins, much struck by Mr. Weller&rsquo;s appearance and conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; chimed in Mrs. Sanders, who, from certain wistful glances
      at the little tin saucepan, seemed to be engaged in a mental calculation
      of the probable extent of the pettitoes, in the event of Sam&rsquo;s being asked
      to stop to supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So all I&rsquo;ve come about, is jest this here,&rsquo; said Sam, disregarding the
      interruption; &lsquo;first, to give my governor&rsquo;s notice&mdash;there it is.
      Secondly, to pay the rent&mdash;here it is. Thirdly, to say as all his
      things is to be put together, and give to anybody as we sends for &lsquo;em.
      Fourthly, that you may let the place as soon as you like&mdash;and that&rsquo;s
      all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever has happened,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell, &lsquo;I always have said, and
      always will say, that in every respect but one, Mr. Pickwick has always
      behaved himself like a perfect gentleman. His money always as good as the
      bank&mdash;always.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. Bardell said this, she applied her handkerchief to her eyes, and
      went out of the room to get the receipt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam well knew that he had only to remain quiet, and the women were sure to
      talk; so he looked alternately at the tin saucepan, the toasted cheese,
      the wall, and the ceiling, in profound silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor dear!&rsquo; said Mrs. Cluppins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, poor thing!&rsquo; replied Mrs. Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam said nothing. He saw they were coming to the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I raly cannot contain myself,&rsquo; said Mrs. Cluppins, &lsquo;when I think of such
      perjury. I don&rsquo;t wish to say anything to make you uncomfortable, young
      man, but your master&rsquo;s an old brute, and I wish I had him here to tell him
      so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish you had,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To see how dreadful she takes on, going moping about, and taking no
      pleasure in nothing, except when her friends comes in, out of charity, to
      sit with her, and make her comfortable,&rsquo; resumed Mrs. Cluppins, glancing
      at the tin saucepan and the Dutch oven, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s shocking!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Barbareous,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And your master, young man! A gentleman with money, as could never feel
      the expense of a wife, no more than nothing,&rsquo; continued Mrs. Cluppins,
      with great volubility; &lsquo;why there ain&rsquo;t the faintest shade of an excuse
      for his behaviour! Why don&rsquo;t he marry her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;to be sure; that&rsquo;s the question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Question, indeed,&rsquo; retorted Mrs. Cluppins, &lsquo;she&rsquo;d question him, if she&rsquo;d
      my spirit. Hows&rsquo;ever, there is law for us women, mis&rsquo;rable creeturs as
      they&rsquo;d make us, if they could; and that your master will find out, young
      man, to his cost, afore he&rsquo;s six months older.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this consolatory reflection, Mrs. Cluppins bridled up, and smiled at
      Mrs. Sanders, who smiled back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The action&rsquo;s going on, and no mistake,&rsquo; thought Sam, as Mrs. Bardell
      re-entered with the receipt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the receipt, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell, &lsquo;and here&rsquo;s the
      change, and I hope you&rsquo;ll take a little drop of something to keep the cold
      out, if it&rsquo;s only for old acquaintance&rsquo; sake, Mr. Weller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam saw the advantage he should gain, and at once acquiesced; whereupon
      Mrs. Bardell produced, from a small closet, a black bottle and a
      wine-glass; and so great was her abstraction, in her deep mental
      affliction, that, after filling Mr. Weller&rsquo;s glass, she brought out three
      more wine-glasses, and filled them too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lauk, Mrs. Bardell,&rsquo; said Mrs. Cluppins, &lsquo;see what you&rsquo;ve been and done!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that is a good one!&rsquo; ejaculated Mrs. Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, my poor head!&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell, with a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam understood all this, of course, so he said at once, that he never
      could drink before supper, unless a lady drank with him. A great deal of
      laughter ensued, and Mrs. Sanders volunteered to humour him, so she took a
      slight sip out of her glass. Then Sam said it must go all round, so they
      all took a slight sip. Then little Mrs. Cluppins proposed as a toast,
      &lsquo;Success to Bardell agin Pickwick&rsquo;; and then the ladies emptied their
      glasses in honour of the sentiment, and got very talkative directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve heard what&rsquo;s going forward, Mr. Weller?&rsquo; said Mrs.
      Bardell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heerd somethin&rsquo; on it,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a terrible thing to be dragged before the public, in that way, Mr.
      Weller,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell; &lsquo;but I see now, that it&rsquo;s the only thing I
      ought to do, and my lawyers, Mr. Dodson and Fogg, tell me that, with the
      evidence as we shall call, we must succeed. I don&rsquo;t know what I should do,
      Mr. Weller, if I didn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mere idea of Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s failing in her action, affected Mrs.
      Sanders so deeply, that she was under the necessity of refilling and
      re-emptying her glass immediately; feeling, as she said afterwards, that
      if she hadn&rsquo;t had the presence of mind to do so, she must have dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ven is it expected to come on?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Either in February or March,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Bardell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a number of witnesses there&rsquo;ll be, won&rsquo;t there?&rsquo; said Mrs. Cluppins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! won&rsquo;t there!&rsquo; replied Mrs. Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And won&rsquo;t Mr. Dodson and Fogg be wild if the plaintiff shouldn&rsquo;t get it?&rsquo; 
      added Mrs. Cluppins, &lsquo;when they do it all on speculation!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! won&rsquo;t they!&rsquo; said Mrs. Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the plaintiff must get it,&rsquo; resumed Mrs. Cluppins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope so,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, there can&rsquo;t be any doubt about it,&rsquo; rejoined Mrs. Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell,&rsquo; said Sam, rising and setting down his glass, &lsquo;all I can say is,
      that I vish you <i>may </i>get it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And of them Dodson and Foggs, as does these sort o&rsquo; things on spec,&rsquo; 
      continued Mr. Weller, &lsquo;as vell as for the other kind and gen&rsquo;rous people
      o&rsquo; the same purfession, as sets people by the ears, free gratis for
      nothin&rsquo;, and sets their clerks to work to find out little disputes among
      their neighbours and acquaintances as vants settlin&rsquo; by means of lawsuits&mdash;all
      I can say o&rsquo; them is, that I vish they had the reward I&rsquo;d give &lsquo;em.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I wish they had the reward that every kind and generous heart would
      be inclined to bestow upon them!&rsquo; said the gratified Mrs. Bardell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Amen to that,&rsquo; replied Sam, &lsquo;and a fat and happy liven&rsquo; they&rsquo;d get out of
      it! Wish you good-night, ladies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To the great relief of Mrs. Sanders, Sam was allowed to depart without any
      reference, on the part of the hostess, to the pettitoes and toasted
      cheese; to which the ladies, with such juvenile assistance as Master
      Bardell could afford, soon afterwards rendered the amplest justice&mdash;indeed
      they wholly vanished before their strenuous exertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller wended his way back to the George and Vulture, and faithfully
      recounted to his master, such indications of the sharp practice of Dodson
      &amp; Fogg, as he had contrived to pick up in his visit to Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s.
      An interview with Mr. Perker, next day, more than confirmed Mr. Weller&rsquo;s
      statement; and Mr. Pickwick was fain to prepare for his Christmas visit to
      Dingley Dell, with the pleasant anticipation that some two or three months
      afterwards, an action brought against him for damages sustained by reason
      of a breach of promise of marriage, would be publicly tried in the Court
      of Common Pleas; the plaintiff having all the advantages derivable, not
      only from the force of circumstances, but from the sharp practice of
      Dodson &amp; Fogg to boot.

      CHAPTER XXVII. SAMUEL WELLER MAKES A PILGRIMAGE TO DORKING, AND BEHOLDS
      HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here still
      remaining an interval of two days before the time agreed upon for the
      departure of the Pickwickians to Dingley Dell, Mr. Weller sat himself down
      in a back room at the George and Vulture, after eating an early dinner, to
      muse on the best way of disposing of his time. It was a remarkably fine
      day; and he had not turned the matter over in his mind ten minutes, when
      he was suddenly stricken filial and affectionate; and it occurred to him
      so strongly that he ought to go down and see his father, and pay his duty
      to his mother-in-law, that he was lost in astonishment at his own
      remissness in never thinking of this moral obligation before. Anxious to
      atone for his past neglect without another hour&rsquo;s delay, he straightway
      walked upstairs to Mr. Pickwick, and requested leave of absence for this
      laudable purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, Sam, certainly,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, his eyes glistening with
      delight at this manifestation of filial feeling on the part of his
      attendant; &lsquo;certainly, Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller made a grateful bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very glad to see that you have so high a sense of your duties as a
      son, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I always had, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a very gratifying reflection, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; &lsquo;if ever I wanted anythin&rsquo; o&rsquo; my father,
      I always asked for it in a wery &lsquo;spectful and obligin&rsquo; manner. If he
      didn&rsquo;t give it me, I took it, for fear I should be led to do anythin&rsquo; 
      wrong, through not havin&rsquo; it. I saved him a world o&rsquo; trouble this vay,
      Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not precisely what I meant, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, shaking his
      head, with a slight smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All good feelin&rsquo;, sir&mdash;the wery best intentions, as the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n
      said ven he run away from his wife &lsquo;cos she seemed unhappy with him,&rsquo; 
      replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may go, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; and having made his best bow, and put
      on his best clothes, Sam planted himself on the top of the Arundel coach,
      and journeyed on to Dorking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis of Granby, in Mrs. Weller&rsquo;s time, was quite a model of a
      roadside public-house of the better class&mdash;just large enough to be
      convenient, and small enough to be snug. On the opposite side of the road
      was a large sign-board on a high post, representing the head and shoulders
      of a gentleman with an apoplectic countenance, in a red coat with deep
      blue facings, and a touch of the same blue over his three-cornered hat,
      for a sky. Over that again were a pair of flags; beneath the last button
      of his coat were a couple of cannon; and the whole formed an expressive
      and undoubted likeness of the Marquis of Granby of glorious memory. The
      bar window displayed a choice collection of geranium plants, and a
      well-dusted row of spirit phials. The open shutters bore a variety of
      golden inscriptions, eulogistic of good beds and neat wines; and the
      choice group of countrymen and hostlers lounging about the stable door and
      horse-trough, afforded presumptive proof of the excellent quality of the
      ale and spirits which were sold within. Sam Weller paused, when he
      dismounted from the coach, to note all these little indications of a
      thriving business, with the eye of an experienced traveller; and having
      done so, stepped in at once, highly satisfied with everything he had
      observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, then!&rsquo; said a shrill female voice the instant Sam thrust his head in
      at the door, &lsquo;what do you want, young man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam looked round in the direction whence the voice proceeded. It came from
      a rather stout lady of comfortable appearance, who was seated beside the
      fireplace in the bar, blowing the fire to make the kettle boil for tea.
      She was not alone; for on the other side of the fireplace, sitting bolt
      upright in a high-backed chair, was a man in threadbare black clothes,
      with a back almost as long and stiff as that of the chair itself, who
      caught Sam&rsquo;s most particular and especial attention at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a prim-faced, red-nosed man, with a long, thin countenance, and a
      semi-rattlesnake sort of eye&mdash;rather sharp, but decidedly bad. He
      wore very short trousers, and black cotton stockings, which, like the rest
      of his apparel, were particularly rusty. His looks were starched, but his
      white neckerchief was not, and its long limp ends straggled over his
      closely-buttoned waistcoat in a very uncouth and unpicturesque fashion. A
      pair of old, worn, beaver gloves, a broad-brimmed hat, and a faded green
      umbrella, with plenty of whalebone sticking through the bottom, as if to
      counterbalance the want of a handle at the top, lay on a chair beside him;
      and, being disposed in a very tidy and careful manner, seemed to imply
      that the red-nosed man, whoever he was, had no intention of going away in
      a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do the red-nosed man justice, he would have been very far from wise if
      he had entertained any such intention; for, to judge from all appearances,
      he must have been possessed of a most desirable circle of acquaintance, if
      he could have reasonably expected to be more comfortable anywhere else.
      The fire was blazing brightly under the influence of the bellows, and the
      kettle was singing gaily under the influence of both. A small tray of
      tea-things was arranged on the table; a plate of hot buttered toast was
      gently simmering before the fire; and the red-nosed man himself was busily
      engaged in converting a large slice of bread into the same agreeable
      edible, through the instrumentality of a long brass toasting-fork. Beside
      him stood a glass of reeking hot pine-apple rum-and-water, with a slice of
      lemon in it; and every time the red-nosed man stopped to bring the round
      of toast to his eye, with the view of ascertaining how it got on, he
      imbibed a drop or two of the hot pine-apple rum-and-water, and smiled upon
      the rather stout lady, as she blew the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam was so lost in the contemplation of this comfortable scene, that he
      suffered the first inquiry of the rather stout lady to pass unheeded. It
      was not until it had been twice repeated, each time in a shriller tone,
      that he became conscious of the impropriety of his behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Governor in?&rsquo; inquired Sam, in reply to the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Weller; for the rather stout lady was no
      other than the quondam relict and sole executrix of the dead-and-gone Mr.
      Clarke; &lsquo;no, he isn&rsquo;t, and I don&rsquo;t expect him, either.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s drivin&rsquo; up to-day?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He may be, or he may not,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Weller, buttering the round of
      toast which the red-nosed man had just finished. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, and,
      what&rsquo;s more, I don&rsquo;t care.&mdash;Ask a blessin&rsquo;, Mr. Stiggins.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The red-nosed man did as he was desired, and instantly commenced on the
      toast with fierce voracity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of the red-nosed man had induced Sam, at first sight, to
      more than half suspect that he was the deputy-shepherd of whom his
      estimable parent had spoken. The moment he saw him eat, all doubt on the
      subject was removed, and he perceived at once that if he purposed to take
      up his temporary quarters where he was, he must make his footing good
      without delay. He therefore commenced proceedings by putting his arm over
      the half-door of the bar, coolly unbolting it, and leisurely walking in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother-in-law,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;how are you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I do believe he is a Weller!&rsquo; said Mrs. W., raising her eyes to
      Sam&rsquo;s face, with no very gratified expression of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I rayther think he is,&rsquo; said the imperturbable Sam; &lsquo;and I hope this here
      reverend gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n &lsquo;ll excuse me saying that I wish I was <i>the </i>Weller
      as owns you, mother-in-law.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a double-barrelled compliment. It implied that Mrs. Weller was a
      most agreeable female, and also that Mr. Stiggins had a clerical
      appearance. It made a visible impression at once; and Sam followed up his
      advantage by kissing his mother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get along with you!&rsquo; said Mrs. Weller, pushing him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For shame, young man!&rsquo; said the gentleman with the red nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No offence, sir, no offence,&rsquo; replied Sam; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re wery right, though; it
      ain&rsquo;t the right sort o&rsquo; thing, ven mothers-in-law is young and
      good-looking, is it, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all vanity,&rsquo; said Mr. Stiggins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, so it is,&rsquo; said Mrs. Weller, setting her cap to rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam thought it was, too, but he held his peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deputy-shepherd seemed by no means best pleased with Sam&rsquo;s arrival;
      and when the first effervescence of the compliment had subsided, even Mrs.
      Weller looked as if she could have spared him without the smallest
      inconvenience. However, there he was; and as he couldn&rsquo;t be decently
      turned out, they all three sat down to tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how&rsquo;s father?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this inquiry, Mrs. Weller raised her hands, and turned up her eyes, as
      if the subject were too painful to be alluded to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stiggins groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with that &lsquo;ere gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s shocked at the way your father goes on in,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, he is, is he?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And with too good reason,&rsquo; added Mrs. Weller gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stiggins took up a fresh piece of toast, and groaned heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a dreadful reprobate,&rsquo; said Mrs. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A man of wrath!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Stiggins. He took a large semi-circular
      bite out of the toast, and groaned again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam felt very strongly disposed to give the reverend Mr. Stiggins
      something to groan for, but he repressed his inclination, and merely
      asked, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the old &lsquo;un up to now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Up to, indeed!&rsquo; said Mrs. Weller, &lsquo;Oh, he has a hard heart. Night after
      night does this excellent man&mdash;don&rsquo;t frown, Mr. Stiggins; I <i>will
      </i>say you <i>are </i>an excellent man&mdash;come and sit here, for hours
      together, and it has not the least effect upon him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that is odd,&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;it &lsquo;ud have a wery considerable effect upon
      me, if I wos in his place; I know that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fact is, my young friend,&rsquo; said Mr. Stiggins solemnly, &lsquo;he has an
      obderrate bosom. Oh, my young friend, who else could have resisted the
      pleading of sixteen of our fairest sisters, and withstood their
      exhortations to subscribe to our noble society for providing the infant
      negroes in the West Indies with flannel waistcoats and moral
      pocket-handkerchiefs?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s a moral pocket-ankercher?&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;I never see one o&rsquo; them
      articles o&rsquo; furniter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those which combine amusement With instruction, my young friend,&rsquo; replied
      Mr. Stiggins, &lsquo;blending select tales with wood-cuts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I know,&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;them as hangs up in the linen-drapers&rsquo; shops,
      with beggars&rsquo; petitions and all that &lsquo;ere upon &lsquo;em?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stiggins began a third round of toast, and nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he wouldn&rsquo;t be persuaded by the ladies, wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sat and smoked his pipe, and said the infant negroes were&mdash;what did
      he say the infant negroes were?&rsquo; said Mrs. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Little humbugs,&rsquo; replied Mr. Stiggins, deeply affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Said the infant negroes were little humbugs,&rsquo; repeated Mrs. Weller. And
      they both groaned at the atrocious conduct of the elder Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great many more iniquities of a similar nature might have been
      disclosed, only the toast being all eaten, the tea having got very weak,
      and Sam holding out no indications of meaning to go, Mr. Stiggins suddenly
      recollected that he had a most pressing appointment with the shepherd, and
      took himself off accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tea-things had been scarcely put away, and the hearth swept up, when
      the London coach deposited Mr. Weller, senior, at the door; his legs
      deposited him in the bar; and his eyes showed him his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, Sammy!&rsquo; exclaimed the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, old Nobs!&rsquo; ejaculated the son. And they shook hands heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery glad to see you, Sammy,&rsquo; said the elder Mr. Weller, &lsquo;though how
      you&rsquo;ve managed to get over your mother-in-law, is a mystery to me. I only
      vish you&rsquo;d write me out the receipt, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;she&rsquo;s at home, old feller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She ain&rsquo;t vithin hearin&rsquo;,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; &lsquo;she always goes and blows
      up, downstairs, for a couple of hours arter tea; so we&rsquo;ll just give
      ourselves a damp, Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, Mr. Weller mixed two glasses of spirits-and-water, and
      produced a couple of pipes. The father and son sitting down opposite each
      other; Sam on one side of the fire, in the high-backed chair, and Mr.
      Weller, senior, on the other, in an easy ditto, they proceeded to enjoy
      themselves with all due gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anybody been here, Sammy?&rsquo; asked Mr. Weller, senior, dryly, after a long
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam nodded an expressive assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Red-nosed chap?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam nodded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Amiable man that &lsquo;ere, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, smoking violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seems so,&rsquo; observed Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good hand at accounts,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Is he?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Borrows eighteenpence on Monday, and comes on Tuesday for a shillin&rsquo; to
      make it up half-a-crown; calls again on Vensday for another half-crown to
      make it five shillin&rsquo;s; and goes on, doubling, till he gets it up to a
      five pund note in no time, like them sums in the &lsquo;rithmetic book &lsquo;bout the
      nails in the horse&rsquo;s shoes, Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam intimated by a nod that he recollected the problem alluded to by his
      parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you vouldn&rsquo;t subscribe to the flannel veskits?&rsquo; said Sam, after
      another interval of smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cert&rsquo;nly not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the good o&rsquo; flannel veskits to
      the young niggers abroad? But I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Weller, lowering his voice, and bending across the fireplace; &lsquo;I&rsquo;d come
      down wery handsome towards strait veskits for some people at home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Weller said this, he slowly recovered his former position, and
      winked at his first-born, in a profound manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It cert&rsquo;nly seems a queer start to send out pocket-&rsquo;ankerchers to people
      as don&rsquo;t know the use on &lsquo;em,&rsquo; observed Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re alvays a-doin&rsquo; some gammon of that sort, Sammy,&rsquo; replied his
      father. &lsquo;T&rsquo;other Sunday I wos walkin&rsquo; up the road, wen who should I see,
      a-standin&rsquo; at a chapel door, with a blue soup-plate in her hand, but your
      mother-in-law! I werily believe there was change for a couple o&rsquo; suv&rsquo;rins
      in it, then, Sammy, all in ha&rsquo;pence; and as the people come out, they
      rattled the pennies in it, till you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; thought that no mortal plate as
      ever was baked, could ha&rsquo; stood the wear and tear. What d&rsquo;ye think it was
      all for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For another tea-drinkin&rsquo;, perhaps,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit on it,&rsquo; replied the father; &lsquo;for the shepherd&rsquo;s water-rate,
      Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The shepherd&rsquo;s water-rate!&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, &lsquo;there was three quarters owin&rsquo;, and the
      shepherd hadn&rsquo;t paid a farden, not he&mdash;perhaps it might be on account
      that the water warn&rsquo;t o&rsquo; much use to him, for it&rsquo;s wery little o&rsquo; that tap
      he drinks, Sammy, wery; he knows a trick worth a good half-dozen of that,
      he does. Hows&rsquo;ever, it warn&rsquo;t paid, and so they cuts the water off. Down
      goes the shepherd to chapel, gives out as he&rsquo;s a persecuted saint, and
      says he hopes the heart of the turncock as cut the water off, &lsquo;ll be
      softened, and turned in the right vay, but he rayther thinks he&rsquo;s booked
      for somethin&rsquo; uncomfortable. Upon this, the women calls a meetin&rsquo;, sings a
      hymn, wotes your mother-in-law into the chair, wolunteers a collection
      next Sunday, and hands it all over to the shepherd. And if he ain&rsquo;t got
      enough out on &lsquo;em, Sammy, to make him free of the water company for life,&rsquo; 
      said Mr. Weller, in conclusion, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m one Dutchman, and you&rsquo;re another, and
      that&rsquo;s all about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller smoked for some minutes in silence, and then resumed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The worst o&rsquo; these here shepherds is, my boy, that they reg&rsquo;larly turns
      the heads of all the young ladies, about here. Lord bless their little
      hearts, they thinks it&rsquo;s all right, and don&rsquo;t know no better; but they&rsquo;re
      the wictims o&rsquo; gammon, Samivel, they&rsquo;re the wictims o&rsquo; gammon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I s&rsquo;pose they are,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothin&rsquo; else,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, shaking his head gravely; &lsquo;and wot
      aggrawates me, Samivel, is to see &lsquo;em a-wastin&rsquo; all their time and labour
      in making clothes for copper-coloured people as don&rsquo;t want &lsquo;em, and taking
      no notice of flesh-coloured Christians as do. If I&rsquo;d my vay, Samivel, I&rsquo;d
      just stick some o&rsquo; these here lazy shepherds behind a heavy wheelbarrow,
      and run &lsquo;em up and down a fourteen-inch-wide plank all day. That &lsquo;ud shake
      the nonsense out of &lsquo;em, if anythin&rsquo; vould.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller, having delivered this gentle recipe with strong emphasis, eked
      out by a variety of nods and contortions of the eye, emptied his glass at
      a draught, and knocked the ashes out of his pipe, with native dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was engaged in this operation, when a shrill voice was heard in the
      passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s your dear relation, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller; and Mrs. W. hurried
      into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve come back, have you!&rsquo; said Mrs. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my dear,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, filling a fresh pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has Mr. Stiggins been back?&rsquo; said Mrs. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, my dear, he hasn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, lighting the pipe by the
      ingenious process of holding to the bowl thereof, between the tongs, a
      red-hot coal from the adjacent fire; and what&rsquo;s more, my dear, I shall
      manage to surwive it, if he don&rsquo;t come back at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ugh, you wretch!&rsquo; said Mrs. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, my love,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come, father,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;none o&rsquo; these little lovin&rsquo;s afore
      strangers. Here&rsquo;s the reverend gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n a-comin&rsquo; in now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this announcement, Mrs. Weller hastily wiped off the tears which she
      had just begun to force on; and Mr. W. drew his chair sullenly into the
      chimney-corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stiggins was easily prevailed on to take another glass of the hot
      pine-apple rum-and-water, and a second, and a third, and then to refresh
      himself with a slight supper, previous to beginning again. He sat on the
      same side as Mr. Weller, senior; and every time he could contrive to do
      so, unseen by his wife, that gentleman indicated to his son the hidden
      emotions of his bosom, by shaking his fist over the deputy-shepherd&rsquo;s
      head; a process which afforded his son the most unmingled delight and
      satisfaction, the more especially as Mr. Stiggins went on, quietly
      drinking the hot pine-apple rum-and-water, wholly unconscious of what was
      going forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The major part of the conversation was confined to Mrs. Weller and the
      reverend Mr. Stiggins; and the topics principally descanted on, were the
      virtues of the shepherd, the worthiness of his flock, and the high crimes
      and misdemeanours of everybody beside&mdash;dissertations which the elder
      Mr. Weller occasionally interrupted by half-suppressed references to a
      gentleman of the name of Walker, and other running commentaries of the
      same kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Mr. Stiggins, with several most indubitable symptoms of having
      quite as much pine-apple rum-and-water about him as he could comfortably
      accommodate, took his hat, and his leave; and Sam was, immediately
      afterwards, shown to bed by his father. The respectable old gentleman
      wrung his hand fervently, and seemed disposed to address some observation
      to his son; but on Mrs. Weller advancing towards him, he appeared to
      relinquish that intention, and abruptly bade him good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam was up betimes next day, and having partaken of a hasty breakfast,
      prepared to return to London. He had scarcely set foot without the house,
      when his father stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goin&rsquo;, Sammy?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Off at once,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I vish you could muffle that &lsquo;ere Stiggins, and take him vith you,&rsquo; said
      Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am ashamed on you!&rsquo; said Sam reproachfully; &lsquo;what do you let him show
      his red nose in the Markis o&rsquo; Granby at all, for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller the elder fixed on his son an earnest look, and replied,
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m a married man, Samivel, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m a married man. Ven you&rsquo;re a
      married man, Samivel, you&rsquo;ll understand a good many things as you don&rsquo;t
      understand now; but vether it&rsquo;s worth while goin&rsquo; through so much, to
      learn so little, as the charity-boy said ven he got to the end of the
      alphabet, is a matter o&rsquo; taste. I rayther think it isn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Well,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;good-bye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tar, tar, Sammy,&rsquo; replied his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve only got to say this here,&rsquo; said Sam, stopping short, &lsquo;that if I was
      the properiator o&rsquo; the Markis o&rsquo; Granby, and that &lsquo;ere Stiggins came and
      made toast in my bar, I&rsquo;d&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; interposed Mr. Weller, with great anxiety. &lsquo;What?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pison his rum-and-water,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, shaking his son eagerly by the hand, &lsquo;would you
      raly, Sammy-would you, though?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be too hard upon him at first. I&rsquo;d drop
      him in the water-butt, and put the lid on; and if I found he was
      insensible to kindness, I&rsquo;d try the other persvasion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Mr. Weller bestowed a look of deep, unspeakable admiration on
      his son, and, having once more grasped his hand, walked slowly away,
      revolving in his mind the numerous reflections to which his advice had
      given rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam looked after him, until he turned a corner of the road; and then set
      forward on his walk to London. He meditated at first, on the probable
      consequences of his own advice, and the likelihood of his father&rsquo;s
      adopting it. He dismissed the subject from his mind, however, with the
      consolatory reflection that time alone would show; and this is the
      reflection we would impress upon the reader.

      CHAPTER XXVIII. A GOOD-HUMOURED CHRISTMAS CHAPTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT
      OF A WEDDING, AND SOME OTHER SPORTS BESIDE: WHICH ALTHOUGH IN THEIR WAY,
      EVEN AS GOOD CUSTOMS AS MARRIAGE ITSELF, ARE NOT QUITE SO RELIGIOUSLY KEPT
      UP, IN THESE DEGENERATE TIMES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s brisk as bees,
      if not altogether as light as fairies, did the four Pickwickians assemble
      on the morning of the twenty-second day of December, in the year of grace
      in which these, their faithfully-recorded adventures, were undertaken and
      accomplished. Christmas was close at hand, in all his bluff and hearty
      honesty; it was the season of hospitality, merriment, and
      open-heartedness; the old year was preparing, like an ancient philosopher,
      to call his friends around him, and amidst the sound of feasting and
      revelry to pass gently and calmly away. Gay and merry was the time; and
      right gay and merry were at least four of the numerous hearts that were
      gladdened by its coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      And numerous indeed are the hearts to which Christmas brings a brief
      season of happiness and enjoyment. How many families, whose members have
      been dispersed and scattered far and wide, in the restless struggles of
      life, are then reunited, and meet once again in that happy state of
      companionship and mutual goodwill, which is a source of such pure and
      unalloyed delight; and one so incompatible with the cares and sorrows of
      the world, that the religious belief of the most civilised nations, and
      the rude traditions of the roughest savages, alike number it among the
      first joys of a future condition of existence, provided for the blessed
      and happy! How many old recollections, and how many dormant sympathies,
      does Christmas time awaken!
    </p>
    <p>
      We write these words now, many miles distant from the spot at which, year
      after year, we met on that day, a merry and joyous circle. Many of the
      hearts that throbbed so gaily then, have ceased to beat; many of the looks
      that shone so brightly then, have ceased to glow; the hands we grasped,
      have grown cold; the eyes we sought, have hid their lustre in the grave;
      and yet the old house, the room, the merry voices and smiling faces, the
      jest, the laugh, the most minute and trivial circumstances connected with
      those happy meetings, crowd upon our mind at each recurrence of the
      season, as if the last assemblage had been but yesterday! Happy, happy
      Christmas, that can win us back to the delusions of our childish days;
      that can recall to the old man the pleasures of his youth; that can
      transport the sailor and the traveller, thousands of miles away, back to
      his own fireside and his quiet home!
    </p>
    <p>
      But we are so taken up and occupied with the good qualities of this saint
      Christmas, that we are keeping Mr. Pickwick and his friends waiting in the
      cold on the outside of the Muggleton coach, which they have just attained,
      well wrapped up in great-coats, shawls, and comforters. The portmanteaus
      and carpet-bags have been stowed away, and Mr. Weller and the guard are
      endeavouring to insinuate into the fore-boot a huge cod-fish several sizes
      too large for it&mdash;which is snugly packed up, in a long brown basket,
      with a layer of straw over the top, and which has been left to the last,
      in order that he may repose in safety on the half-dozen barrels of real
      native oysters, all the property of Mr. Pickwick, which have been arranged
      in regular order at the bottom of the receptacle. The interest displayed
      in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s countenance is most intense, as Mr. Weller and the guard
      try to squeeze the cod-fish into the boot, first head first, and then tail
      first, and then top upward, and then bottom upward, and then side-ways,
      and then long-ways, all of which artifices the implacable cod-fish
      sturdily resists, until the guard accidentally hits him in the very middle
      of the basket, whereupon he suddenly disappears into the boot, and with
      him, the head and shoulders of the guard himself, who, not calculating
      upon so sudden a cessation of the passive resistance of the cod-fish,
      experiences a very unexpected shock, to the unsmotherable delight of all
      the porters and bystanders. Upon this, Mr. Pickwick smiles with great
      good-humour, and drawing a shilling from his waistcoat pocket, begs the
      guard, as he picks himself out of the boot, to drink his health in a glass
      of hot brandy-and-water; at which the guard smiles too, and Messrs.
      Snodgrass, Winkle, and Tupman, all smile in company. The guard and Mr.
      Weller disappear for five minutes, most probably to get the hot
      brandy-and-water, for they smell very strongly of it, when they return,
      the coachman mounts to the box, Mr. Weller jumps up behind, the
      Pickwickians pull their coats round their legs and their shawls over their
      noses, the helpers pull the horse-cloths off, the coachman shouts out a
      cheery &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; and away they go.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have rumbled through the streets, and jolted over the stones, and at
      length reach the wide and open country. The wheels skim over the hard and
      frosty ground; and the horses, bursting into a canter at a smart crack of
      the whip, step along the road as if the load behind them&mdash;coach,
      passengers, cod-fish, oyster-barrels, and all&mdash;were but a feather at
      their heels. They have descended a gentle slope, and enter upon a level,
      as compact and dry as a solid block of marble, two miles long. Another
      crack of the whip, and on they speed, at a smart gallop, the horses
      tossing their heads and rattling the harness, as if in exhilaration at the
      rapidity of the motion; while the coachman, holding whip and reins in one
      hand, takes off his hat with the other, and resting it on his knees, pulls
      out his handkerchief, and wipes his forehead, partly because he has a
      habit of doing it, and partly because it&rsquo;s as well to show the passengers
      how cool he is, and what an easy thing it is to drive four-in-hand, when
      you have had as much practice as he has. Having done this very leisurely
      (otherwise the effect would be materially impaired), he replaces his
      handkerchief, pulls on his hat, adjusts his gloves, squares his elbows,
      cracks the whip again, and on they speed, more merrily than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few small houses, scattered on either side of the road, betoken the
      entrance to some town or village. The lively notes of the guard&rsquo;s
      key-bugle vibrate in the clear cold air, and wake up the old gentleman
      inside, who, carefully letting down the window-sash half-way, and standing
      sentry over the air, takes a short peep out, and then carefully pulling it
      up again, informs the other inside that they&rsquo;re going to change directly;
      on which the other inside wakes himself up, and determines to postpone his
      next nap until after the stoppage. Again the bugle sounds lustily forth,
      and rouses the cottager&rsquo;s wife and children, who peep out at the house
      door, and watch the coach till it turns the corner, when they once more
      crouch round the blazing fire, and throw on another log of wood against
      father comes home; while father himself, a full mile off, has just
      exchanged a friendly nod with the coachman, and turned round to take a
      good long stare at the vehicle as it whirls away.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the bugle plays a lively air as the coach rattles through the
      ill-paved streets of a country town; and the coachman, undoing the buckle
      which keeps his ribands together, prepares to throw them off the moment he
      stops. Mr. Pickwick emerges from his coat collar, and looks about him with
      great curiosity; perceiving which, the coachman informs Mr. Pickwick of
      the name of the town, and tells him it was market-day yesterday, both of
      which pieces of information Mr. Pickwick retails to his fellow-passengers;
      whereupon they emerge from their coat collars too, and look about them
      also. Mr. Winkle, who sits at the extreme edge, with one leg dangling in
      the air, is nearly precipitated into the street, as the coach twists round
      the sharp corner by the cheesemonger&rsquo;s shop, and turns into the
      market-place; and before Mr. Snodgrass, who sits next to him, has
      recovered from his alarm, they pull up at the inn yard where the fresh
      horses, with cloths on, are already waiting. The coachman throws down the
      reins and gets down himself, and the other outside passengers drop down
      also; except those who have no great confidence in their ability to get up
      again; and they remain where they are, and stamp their feet against the
      coach to warm them&mdash;looking, with longing eyes and red noses, at the
      bright fire in the inn bar, and the sprigs of holly with red berries which
      ornament the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the guard has delivered at the corn-dealer&rsquo;s shop, the brown paper
      packet he took out of the little pouch which hangs over his shoulder by a
      leathern strap; and has seen the horses carefully put to; and has thrown
      on the pavement the saddle which was brought from London on the coach
      roof; and has assisted in the conference between the coachman and the
      hostler about the gray mare that hurt her off fore-leg last Tuesday; and
      he and Mr. Weller are all right behind, and the coachman is all right in
      front, and the old gentleman inside, who has kept the window down full two
      inches all this time, has pulled it up again, and the cloths are off, and
      they are all ready for starting, except the &lsquo;two stout gentlemen,&rsquo; whom
      the coachman inquires after with some impatience. Hereupon the coachman,
      and the guard, and Sam Weller, and Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass, and all
      the hostlers, and every one of the idlers, who are more in number than all
      the others put together, shout for the missing gentlemen as loud as they
      can bawl. A distant response is heard from the yard, and Mr. Pickwick and
      Mr. Tupman come running down it, quite out of breath, for they have been
      having a glass of ale a-piece, and Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s fingers are so cold that
      he has been full five minutes before he could find the sixpence to pay for
      it. The coachman shouts an admonitory &lsquo;Now then, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n,&rsquo; the guard
      re-echoes it; the old gentleman inside thinks it a very extraordinary
      thing that people <i>will </i>get down when they know there isn&rsquo;t time for
      it; Mr. Pickwick struggles up on one side, Mr. Tupman on the other; Mr.
      Winkle cries &lsquo;All right&rsquo;; and off they start. Shawls are pulled up, coat
      collars are readjusted, the pavement ceases, the houses disappear; and
      they are once again dashing along the open road, with the fresh clear air
      blowing in their faces, and gladdening their very hearts within them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the progress of Mr. Pickwick and his friends by the Muggleton
      Telegraph, on their way to Dingley Dell; and at three o&rsquo;clock that
      afternoon they all stood high and dry, safe and sound, hale and hearty,
      upon the steps of the Blue Lion, having taken on the road quite enough of
      ale and brandy, to enable them to bid defiance to the frost that was
      binding up the earth in its iron fetters, and weaving its beautiful
      network upon the trees and hedges. Mr. Pickwick was busily engaged in
      counting the barrels of oysters and superintending the disinterment of the
      cod-fish, when he felt himself gently pulled by the skirts of the coat.
      Looking round, he discovered that the individual who resorted to this mode
      of catching his attention was no other than Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s favourite page,
      better known to the readers of this unvarnished history, by the
      distinguishing appellation of the fat boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; said the fat boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said it, he glanced from the cod-fish to the oyster-barrels, and
      chuckled joyously. He was fatter than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you look rosy enough, my young friend,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been asleep, right in front of the taproom fire,&rsquo; replied the fat
      boy, who had heated himself to the colour of a new chimney-pot, in the
      course of an hour&rsquo;s nap. &lsquo;Master sent me over with the chay-cart, to carry
      your luggage up to the house. He&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; sent some saddle-horses, but he
      thought you&rsquo;d rather walk, being a cold day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick hastily, for he remembered how they had
      travelled over nearly the same ground on a previous occasion. &lsquo;Yes, we
      would rather walk. Here, Sam!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Help Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s servant to put the packages into the cart, and then
      ride on with him. We will walk forward at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having given this direction, and settled with the coachman, Mr. Pickwick
      and his three friends struck into the footpath across the fields, and
      walked briskly away, leaving Mr. Weller and the fat boy confronted
      together for the first time. Sam looked at the fat boy with great
      astonishment, but without saying a word; and began to stow the luggage
      rapidly away in the cart, while the fat boy stood quietly by, and seemed
      to think it a very interesting sort of thing to see Mr. Weller working by
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There,&rsquo; said Sam, throwing in the last carpet-bag, &lsquo;there they are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the fat boy, in a very satisfied tone, &lsquo;there they are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell, young twenty stun,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a nice specimen of a prize
      boy, you are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank&rsquo;ee,&rsquo; said the fat boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; on your mind as makes you fret yourself, have you?&rsquo; 
      inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not as I knows on,&rsquo; replied the fat boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should rayther ha&rsquo; thought, to look at you, that you was a-labourin&rsquo; 
      under an unrequited attachment to some young &lsquo;ooman,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;I am glad to hear it. Do you ever drink anythin&rsquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I likes eating better,&rsquo; replied the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;I should ha&rsquo; s&rsquo;posed that; but what I mean is, should you
      like a drop of anythin&rsquo; as&rsquo;d warm you? but I s&rsquo;pose you never was cold,
      with all them elastic fixtures, was you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sometimes,&rsquo; replied the boy; &lsquo;and I likes a drop of something, when it&rsquo;s
      good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you do, do you?&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;come this way, then!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Blue Lion tap was soon gained, and the fat boy swallowed a glass of
      liquor without so much as winking&mdash;a feat which considerably advanced
      him in Mr. Weller&rsquo;s good opinion. Mr. Weller having transacted a similar
      piece of business on his own account, they got into the cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you drive?&rsquo; said the fat boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should rayther think so,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, then,&rsquo; said the fat boy, putting the reins in his hand, and
      pointing up a lane, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s as straight as you can go; you can&rsquo;t miss it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, the fat boy laid himself affectionately down by the side
      of the cod-fish, and, placing an oyster-barrel under his head for a
      pillow, fell asleep instantaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;of all the cool boys ever I set my eyes on, this here
      young gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n is the coolest. Come, wake up, young dropsy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But as young dropsy evinced no symptoms of returning animation, Sam Weller
      sat himself down in front of the cart, and starting the old horse with a
      jerk of the rein, jogged steadily on, towards the Manor Farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mr. Pickwick and his friends having walked their blood into
      active circulation, proceeded cheerfully on. The paths were hard; the
      grass was crisp and frosty; the air had a fine, dry, bracing coldness; and
      the rapid approach of the gray twilight (slate-coloured is a better term
      in frosty weather) made them look forward with pleasant anticipation to
      the comforts which awaited them at their hospitable entertainer&rsquo;s. It was
      the sort of afternoon that might induce a couple of elderly gentlemen, in
      a lonely field, to take off their greatcoats and play at leap-frog in pure
      lightness of heart and gaiety; and we firmly believe that had Mr. Tupman
      at that moment proffered &lsquo;a back,&rsquo; Mr. Pickwick would have accepted his
      offer with the utmost avidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Mr. Tupman did not volunteer any such accommodation, and the
      friends walked on, conversing merrily. As they turned into a lane they had
      to cross, the sound of many voices burst upon their ears; and before they
      had even had time to form a guess to whom they belonged, they walked into
      the very centre of the party who were expecting their arrival&mdash;a fact
      which was first notified to the Pickwickians, by the loud &lsquo;Hurrah,&rsquo; which
      burst from old Wardle&rsquo;s lips, when they appeared in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, there was Wardle himself, looking, if that were possible, more
      jolly than ever; then there were Bella and her faithful Trundle; and,
      lastly, there were Emily and some eight or ten young ladies, who had all
      come down to the wedding, which was to take place next day, and who were
      in as happy and important a state as young ladies usually are, on such
      momentous occasions; and they were, one and all, startling the fields and
      lanes, far and wide, with their frolic and laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceremony of introduction, under such circumstances, was very soon
      performed, or we should rather say that the introduction was soon over,
      without any ceremony at all. In two minutes thereafter, Mr. Pickwick was
      joking with the young ladies who wouldn&rsquo;t come over the stile while he
      looked&mdash;or who, having pretty feet and unexceptionable ankles,
      preferred standing on the top rail for five minutes or so, declaring that
      they were too frightened to move&mdash;with as much ease and absence of
      reserve or constraint, as if he had known them for life. It is worthy of
      remark, too, that Mr. Snodgrass offered Emily far more assistance than the
      absolute terrors of the stile (although it was full three feet high, and
      had only a couple of stepping-stones) would seem to require; while one
      black-eyed young lady in a very nice little pair of boots with fur round
      the top, was observed to scream very loudly, when Mr. Winkle offered to
      help her over.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was very snug and pleasant. And when the difficulties of the
      stile were at last surmounted, and they once more entered on the open
      field, old Wardle informed Mr. Pickwick how they had all been down in a
      body to inspect the furniture and fittings-up of the house, which the
      young couple were to tenant, after the Christmas holidays; at which
      communication Bella and Trundle both coloured up, as red as the fat boy
      after the taproom fire; and the young lady with the black eyes and the fur
      round the boots, whispered something in Emily&rsquo;s ear, and then glanced
      archly at Mr. Snodgrass; to which Emily responded that she was a foolish
      girl, but turned very red, notwithstanding; and Mr. Snodgrass, who was as
      modest as all great geniuses usually are, felt the crimson rising to the
      crown of his head, and devoutly wished, in the inmost recesses of his own
      heart, that the young lady aforesaid, with her black eyes, and her
      archness, and her boots with the fur round the top, were all comfortably
      deposited in the adjacent county.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if they were social and happy outside the house, what was the warmth
      and cordiality of their reception when they reached the farm! The very
      servants grinned with pleasure at sight of Mr. Pickwick; and Emma bestowed
      a half-demure, half-impudent, and all-pretty look of recognition, on Mr.
      Tupman, which was enough to make the statue of Bonaparte in the passage,
      unfold his arms, and clasp her within them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady was seated with customary state in the front parlour, but she
      was rather cross, and, by consequence, most particularly deaf. She never
      went out herself, and like a great many other old ladies of the same
      stamp, she was apt to consider it an act of domestic treason, if anybody
      else took the liberty of doing what she couldn&rsquo;t. So, bless her old soul,
      she sat as upright as she could, in her great chair, and looked as fierce
      as might be&mdash;and that was benevolent after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; said Wardle, &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick. You recollect him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; replied the old lady, with great dignity. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble Mr.
      Pickwick about an old creetur like me. Nobody cares about me now, and it&rsquo;s
      very nat&rsquo;ral they shouldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; Here the old lady tossed her head, and
      smoothed down her lavender-coloured silk dress with trembling hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t let you cut an old friend
      in this way. I have come down expressly to have a long talk, and another
      rubber with you; and we&rsquo;ll show these boys and girls how to dance a
      minuet, before they&rsquo;re eight-and-forty hours older.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady was rapidly giving way, but she did not like to do it all at
      once; so she only said, &lsquo;Ah! I can&rsquo;t hear him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense, mother,&rsquo; said Wardle. &lsquo;Come, come, don&rsquo;t be cross, there&rsquo;s a
      good soul. Recollect Bella; come, you must keep her spirits up, poor
      girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The good old lady heard this, for her lip quivered as her son said it. But
      age has its little infirmities of temper, and she was not quite brought
      round yet. So, she smoothed down the lavender-coloured dress again, and
      turning to Mr. Pickwick said, &lsquo;Ah, Mr. Pickwick, young people was very
      different, when I was a girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt of that, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;and that&rsquo;s the reason why I
      would make much of the few that have any traces of the old stock&rsquo;&mdash;and
      saying this, Mr. Pickwick gently pulled Bella towards him, and bestowing a
      kiss upon her forehead, bade her sit down on the little stool at her
      grandmother&rsquo;s feet. Whether the expression of her countenance, as it was
      raised towards the old lady&rsquo;s face, called up a thought of old times, or
      whether the old lady was touched by Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s affectionate
      good-nature, or whatever was the cause, she was fairly melted; so she
      threw herself on her granddaughter&rsquo;s neck, and all the little ill-humour
      evaporated in a gush of silent tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      A happy party they were, that night. Sedate and solemn were the score of
      rubbers in which Mr. Pickwick and the old lady played together; uproarious
      was the mirth of the round table. Long after the ladies had retired, did
      the hot elder wine, well qualified with brandy and spice, go round, and
      round, and round again; and sound was the sleep and pleasant were the
      dreams that followed. It is a remarkable fact that those of Mr. Snodgrass
      bore constant reference to Emily Wardle; and that the principal figure in
      Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s visions was a young lady with black eyes, and arch smile, and
      a pair of remarkably nice boots with fur round the tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was awakened early in the morning, by a hum of voices and a
      pattering of feet, sufficient to rouse even the fat boy from his heavy
      slumbers. He sat up in bed and listened. The female servants and female
      visitors were running constantly to and fro; and there were such
      multitudinous demands for hot water, such repeated outcries for needles
      and thread, and so many half-suppressed entreaties of &lsquo;Oh, do come and tie
      me, there&rsquo;s a dear!&rsquo; that Mr. Pickwick in his innocence began to imagine
      that something dreadful must have occurred&mdash;when he grew more awake,
      and remembered the wedding. The occasion being an important one, he
      dressed himself with peculiar care, and descended to the breakfast-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were all the female servants in a bran new uniform of pink muslin
      gowns with white bows in their caps, running about the house in a state of
      excitement and agitation which it would be impossible to describe. The old
      lady was dressed out in a brocaded gown, which had not seen the light for
      twenty years, saving and excepting such truant rays as had stolen through
      the chinks in the box in which it had been laid by, during the whole time.
      Mr. Trundle was in high feather and spirits, but a little nervous withal.
      The hearty old landlord was trying to look very cheerful and unconcerned,
      but failing signally in the attempt. All the girls were in tears and white
      muslin, except a select two or three, who were being honoured with a
      private view of the bride and bridesmaids, upstairs. All the Pickwickians
      were in most blooming array; and there was a terrific roaring on the grass
      in front of the house, occasioned by all the men, boys, and hobbledehoys
      attached to the farm, each of whom had got a white bow in his button-hole,
      and all of whom were cheering with might and main; being incited thereto,
      and stimulated therein by the precept and example of Mr. Samuel Weller,
      who had managed to become mighty popular already, and was as much at home
      as if he had been born on the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wedding is a licensed subject to joke upon, but there really is no great
      joke in the matter after all;&mdash;we speak merely of the ceremony, and
      beg it to be distinctly understood that we indulge in no hidden sarcasm
      upon a married life. Mixed up with the pleasure and joy of the occasion,
      are the many regrets at quitting home, the tears of parting between parent
      and child, the consciousness of leaving the dearest and kindest friends of
      the happiest portion of human life, to encounter its cares and troubles
      with others still untried and little known&mdash;natural feelings which we
      would not render this chapter mournful by describing, and which we should
      be still more unwilling to be supposed to ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us briefly say, then, that the ceremony was performed by the old
      clergyman, in the parish church of Dingley Dell, and that Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      name is attached to the register, still preserved in the vestry thereof;
      that the young lady with the black eyes signed her name in a very unsteady
      and tremulous manner; that Emily&rsquo;s signature, as the other bridesmaid, is
      nearly illegible; that it all went off in very admirable style; that the
      young ladies generally thought it far less shocking than they had
      expected; and that although the owner of the black eyes and the arch smile
      informed Mr. Wardle that she was sure she could never submit to anything
      so dreadful, we have the very best reasons for thinking she was mistaken.
      To all this, we may add, that Mr. Pickwick was the first who saluted the
      bride, and that in so doing he threw over her neck a rich gold watch and
      chain, which no mortal eyes but the jeweller&rsquo;s had ever beheld before.
      Then, the old church bell rang as gaily as it could, and they all returned
      to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vere does the mince-pies go, young opium-eater?&rsquo; said Mr. Weller to the
      fat boy, as he assisted in laying out such articles of consumption as had
      not been duly arranged on the previous night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy pointed to the destination of the pies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;stick a bit o&rsquo; Christmas in &lsquo;em. T&rsquo;other dish
      opposite. There; now we look compact and comfortable, as the father said
      ven he cut his little boy&rsquo;s head off, to cure him o&rsquo; squintin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Weller made the comparison, he fell back a step or two, to give
      full effect to it, and surveyed the preparations with the utmost
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wardle,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, almost as soon as they were all seated, &lsquo;a
      glass of wine in honour of this happy occasion!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be delighted, my boy,&rsquo; said Wardle. &lsquo;Joe&mdash;damn that boy,
      he&rsquo;s gone to sleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I ain&rsquo;t, sir,&rsquo; replied the fat boy, starting up from a remote corner,
      where, like the patron saint of fat boys&mdash;the immortal Horner&mdash;he
      had been devouring a Christmas pie, though not with the coolness and
      deliberation which characterised that young gentleman&rsquo;s proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fill Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s glass.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy filled Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s glass, and then retired behind his
      master&rsquo;s chair, from whence he watched the play of the knives and forks,
      and the progress of the choice morsels from the dishes to the mouths of
      the company, with a kind of dark and gloomy joy that was most impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God bless you, old fellow!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Same to you, my boy,&rsquo; replied Wardle; and they pledged each other,
      heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Wardle,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;we old folks must have a glass of wine
      together, in honour of this joyful event.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady was in a state of great grandeur just then, for she was
      sitting at the top of the table in the brocaded gown, with her
      newly-married granddaughter on one side, and Mr. Pickwick on the other, to
      do the carving. Mr. Pickwick had not spoken in a very loud tone, but she
      understood him at once, and drank off a full glass of wine to his long
      life and happiness; after which the worthy old soul launched forth into a
      minute and particular account of her own wedding, with a dissertation on
      the fashion of wearing high-heeled shoes, and some particulars concerning
      the life and adventures of the beautiful Lady Tollimglower, deceased; at
      all of which the old lady herself laughed very heartily indeed, and so did
      the young ladies too, for they were wondering among themselves what on
      earth grandma was talking about. When they laughed, the old lady laughed
      ten times more heartily, and said that these always had been considered
      capital stories, which caused them all to laugh again, and put the old
      lady into the very best of humours. Then the cake was cut, and passed
      through the ring; the young ladies saved pieces to put under their pillows
      to dream of their future husbands on; and a great deal of blushing and
      merriment was thereby occasioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Miller,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick to his old acquaintance, the hard-headed
      gentleman, &lsquo;a glass of wine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With great satisfaction, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; replied the hard-headed gentleman
      solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll take me in?&rsquo; said the benevolent old clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And me,&rsquo; interposed his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And me, and me,&rsquo; said a couple of poor relations at the bottom of the
      table, who had eaten and drunk very heartily, and laughed at everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick expressed his heartfelt delight at every additional
      suggestion; and his eyes beamed with hilarity and cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, suddenly rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear, hear! Hear, hear! Hear, hear!&rsquo; cried Mr. Weller, in the excitement
      of his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Call in all the servants,&rsquo; cried old Wardle, interposing to prevent the
      public rebuke which Mr. Weller would otherwise most indubitably have
      received from his master. &lsquo;Give them a glass of wine each to drink the
      toast in. Now, Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst the silence of the company, the whispering of the women-servants,
      and the awkward embarrassment of the men, Mr. Pickwick proceeded&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;no, I won&rsquo;t say ladies and gentlemen, I&rsquo;ll
      call you my friends, my dear friends, if the ladies will allow me to take
      so great a liberty&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Pickwick was interrupted by immense applause from the ladies,
      echoed by the gentlemen, during which the owner of the eyes was distinctly
      heard to state that she could kiss that dear Mr. Pickwick. Whereupon Mr.
      Winkle gallantly inquired if it couldn&rsquo;t be done by deputy: to which the
      young lady with the black eyes replied &lsquo;Go away,&rsquo; and accompanied the
      request with a look which said as plainly as a look could do, &lsquo;if you
      can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear friends,&rsquo; resumed Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I am going to propose the health
      of the bride and bridegroom&mdash;God bless &lsquo;em (cheers and tears). My
      young friend, Trundle, I believe to be a very excellent and manly fellow;
      and his wife I know to be a very amiable and lovely girl, well qualified
      to transfer to another sphere of action the happiness which for twenty
      years she has diffused around her, in her father&rsquo;s house. (Here, the fat
      boy burst forth into stentorian blubberings, and was led forth by the coat
      collar, by Mr. Weller.) I wish,&rsquo; added Mr. Pickwick&mdash;&lsquo;I wish I was
      young enough to be her sister&rsquo;s husband (cheers), but, failing that, I am
      happy to be old enough to be her father; for, being so, I shall not be
      suspected of any latent designs when I say, that I admire, esteem, and
      love them both (cheers and sobs). The bride&rsquo;s father, our good friend
      there, is a noble person, and I am proud to know him (great uproar). He is
      a kind, excellent, independent-spirited, fine-hearted, hospitable, liberal
      man (enthusiastic shouts from the poor relations, at all the adjectives;
      and especially at the two last). That his daughter may enjoy all the
      happiness, even he can desire; and that he may derive from the
      contemplation of her felicity all the gratification of heart and peace of
      mind which he so well deserves, is, I am persuaded, our united wish. So,
      let us drink their healths, and wish them prolonged life, and every
      blessing!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick concluded amidst a whirlwind of applause; and once more were
      the lungs of the supernumeraries, under Mr. Weller&rsquo;s command, brought into
      active and efficient operation. Mr. Wardle proposed Mr. Pickwick; Mr.
      Pickwick proposed the old lady. Mr. Snodgrass proposed Mr. Wardle; Mr.
      Wardle proposed Mr. Snodgrass. One of the poor relations proposed Mr.
      Tupman, and the other poor relation proposed Mr. Winkle; all was happiness
      and festivity, until the mysterious disappearance of both the poor
      relations beneath the table, warned the party that it was time to adjourn.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner they met again, after a five-and-twenty mile walk, undertaken by
      the males at Wardle&rsquo;s recommendation, to get rid of the effects of the
      wine at breakfast. The poor relations had kept in bed all day, with the
      view of attaining the same happy consummation, but, as they had been
      unsuccessful, they stopped there. Mr. Weller kept the domestics in a state
      of perpetual hilarity; and the fat boy divided his time into small
      alternate allotments of eating and sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was as hearty an affair as the breakfast, and was quite as
      noisy, without the tears. Then came the dessert and some more toasts. Then
      came the tea and coffee; and then, the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best sitting-room at Manor Farm was a good, long, dark-panelled room
      with a high chimney-piece, and a capacious chimney, up which you could
      have driven one of the new patent cabs, wheels and all. At the upper end
      of the room, seated in a shady bower of holly and evergreens were the two
      best fiddlers, and the only harp, in all Muggleton. In all sorts of
      recesses, and on all kinds of brackets, stood massive old silver
      candlesticks with four branches each. The carpet was up, the candles
      burned bright, the fire blazed and crackled on the hearth, and merry
      voices and light-hearted laughter rang through the room. If any of the old
      English yeomen had turned into fairies when they died, it was just the
      place in which they would have held their revels.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anything could have added to the interest of this agreeable scene, it
      would have been the remarkable fact of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s appearing without
      his gaiters, for the first time within the memory of his oldest friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean to dance?&rsquo; said Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I do,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see I am dressed for
      the purpose?&rsquo; Mr. Pickwick called attention to his speckled silk
      stockings, and smartly tied pumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>You </i>in silk stockings!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Tupman jocosely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why not, sir&mdash;why not?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, turning warmly upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, of course there is no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t wear them,&rsquo; responded
      Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I imagine not, sir&mdash;I imagine not,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, in a very
      peremptory tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman had contemplated a laugh, but he found it was a serious matter;
      so he looked grave, and said they were a pretty pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope they are,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, fixing his eyes upon his friend.
      &lsquo;You see nothing extraordinary in the stockings, <i>as</i> stockings, I
      trust, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not. Oh, certainly not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Tupman. He walked away;
      and Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s countenance resumed its customary benign expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are all ready, I believe,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, who was stationed with
      the old lady at the top of the dance, and had already made four false
      starts, in his excessive anxiety to commence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then begin at once,&rsquo; said Wardle. &lsquo;Now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Up struck the two fiddles and the one harp, and off went Mr. Pickwick into
      hands across, when there was a general clapping of hands, and a cry of
      &lsquo;Stop, stop!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, who was only brought to, by the
      fiddles and harp desisting, and could have been stopped by no other
      earthly power, if the house had been on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Arabella Allen?&rsquo; cried a dozen voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Winkle?&rsquo; added Mr. Tupman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here we are!&rsquo; exclaimed that gentleman, emerging with his pretty
      companion from the corner; as he did so, it would have been hard to tell
      which was the redder in the face, he or the young lady with the black
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What an extraordinary thing it is, Winkle,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, rather
      pettishly, &lsquo;that you couldn&rsquo;t have taken your place before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all extraordinary,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with a very expressive smile, as his eyes
      rested on Arabella, &lsquo;well, I don&rsquo;t know that it <i>was </i>extraordinary,
      either, after all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there was no time to think more about the matter, for the fiddles
      and harp began in real earnest. Away went Mr. Pickwick&mdash;hands across&mdash;down
      the middle to the very end of the room, and half-way up the chimney, back
      again to the door&mdash;poussette everywhere&mdash;loud stamp on the
      ground&mdash;ready for the next couple&mdash;off again&mdash;all the
      figure over once more&mdash;another stamp to beat out the time&mdash;next
      couple, and the next, and the next again&mdash;never was such going; at
      last, after they had reached the bottom of the dance, and full fourteen
      couple after the old lady had retired in an exhausted state, and the
      clergyman&rsquo;s wife had been substituted in her stead, did that gentleman,
      when there was no demand whatever on his exertions, keep perpetually
      dancing in his place, to keep time to the music, smiling on his partner
      all the while with a blandness of demeanour which baffles all description.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Long before Mr. Pickwick was weary of dancing, the newly-married couple
      had retired from the scene. There was a glorious supper downstairs,
      notwithstanding, and a good long sitting after it; and when Mr. Pickwick
      awoke, late the next morning, he had a confused recollection of having,
      severally and confidentially, invited somewhere about five-and-forty
      people to dine with him at the George and Vulture, the very first time
      they came to London; which Mr. Pickwick rightly considered a pretty
      certain indication of his having taken something besides exercise, on the
      previous night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so your family has games in the kitchen to-night, my dear, has they?&rsquo; 
      inquired Sam of Emma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; replied Emma; &lsquo;we always have on Christmas Eve. Master
      wouldn&rsquo;t neglect to keep it up on any account.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your master&rsquo;s a wery pretty notion of keeping anythin&rsquo; up, my dear,&rsquo; said
      Mr. Weller; &lsquo;I never see such a sensible sort of man as he is, or such a
      reg&rsquo;lar gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, that he is!&rsquo; said the fat boy, joining in the conversation; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t he
      breed nice pork!&rsquo; The fat youth gave a semi-cannibalic leer at Mr. Weller,
      as he thought of the roast legs and gravy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve woke up, at last, have you?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, young boa-constructer,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller
      impressively; &lsquo;if you don&rsquo;t sleep a little less, and exercise a little
      more, wen you comes to be a man you&rsquo;ll lay yourself open to the same sort
      of personal inconwenience as was inflicted on the old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n as wore
      the pigtail.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did they do to him?&rsquo; inquired the fat boy, in a faltering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a-going to tell you,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; &lsquo;he was one o&rsquo; the largest
      patterns as was ever turned out&mdash;reg&rsquo;lar fat man, as hadn&rsquo;t caught a
      glimpse of his own shoes for five-and-forty year.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor!&rsquo; exclaimed Emma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, that he hadn&rsquo;t, my dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller; &lsquo;and if you&rsquo;d put an exact
      model of his own legs on the dinin&rsquo;-table afore him, he wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; known
      &lsquo;em. Well, he always walks to his office with a wery handsome gold
      watch-chain hanging out, about a foot and a quarter, and a gold watch in
      his fob pocket as was worth&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid to say how much, but as much
      as a watch can be&mdash;a large, heavy, round manufacter, as stout for a
      watch, as he was for a man, and with a big face in proportion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
      better not carry that &lsquo;ere watch,&rdquo; says the old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n&rsquo;s friends,
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be robbed on it,&rdquo; says they. &ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Yes, you will,&rdquo;
       says they. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I should like to see the thief as could get
      this here watch out, for I&rsquo;m blessed if I ever can, it&rsquo;s such a tight
      fit,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and wenever I vants to know what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock, I&rsquo;m obliged to
      stare into the bakers&rsquo; shops,&rdquo; he says. Well, then he laughs as hearty as
      if he was a-goin&rsquo; to pieces, and out he walks agin with his powdered head
      and pigtail, and rolls down the Strand with the chain hangin&rsquo; out furder
      than ever, and the great round watch almost bustin&rsquo; through his gray
      kersey smalls. There warn&rsquo;t a pickpocket in all London as didn&rsquo;t take a
      pull at that chain, but the chain &lsquo;ud never break, and the watch &lsquo;ud never
      come out, so they soon got tired of dragging such a heavy old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n
      along the pavement, and he&rsquo;d go home and laugh till the pigtail wibrated
      like the penderlum of a Dutch clock. At last, one day the old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n
      was a-rollin&rsquo; along, and he sees a pickpocket as he know&rsquo;d by sight,
      a-coming up, arm in arm with a little boy with a wery large head. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
      a game,&rdquo; says the old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n to himself, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re a-goin&rsquo; to have
      another try, but it won&rsquo;t do!&rdquo; So he begins a-chucklin&rsquo; wery hearty, wen,
      all of a sudden, the little boy leaves hold of the pickpocket&rsquo;s arm, and
      rushes head foremost straight into the old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n&rsquo;s stomach, and for a
      moment doubles him right up with the pain. &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; says the old
      gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n. &ldquo;All right, Sir,&rdquo; says the pickpocket, a-wisperin&rsquo; in his ear.
      And wen he come straight agin, the watch and chain was gone, and what&rsquo;s
      worse than that, the old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n&rsquo;s digestion was all wrong ever
      afterwards, to the wery last day of his life; so just you look about you,
      young feller, and take care you don&rsquo;t get too fat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Weller concluded this moral tale, with which the fat boy appeared
      much affected, they all three repaired to the large kitchen, in which the
      family were by this time assembled, according to annual custom on
      Christmas Eve, observed by old Wardle&rsquo;s forefathers from time immemorial.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the centre of the ceiling of this kitchen, old Wardle had just
      suspended, with his own hands, a huge branch of mistletoe, and this same
      branch of mistletoe instantaneously gave rise to a scene of general and
      most delightful struggling and confusion; in the midst of which, Mr.
      Pickwick, with a gallantry that would have done honour to a descendant of
      Lady Tollimglower herself, took the old lady by the hand, led her beneath
      the mystic branch, and saluted her in all courtesy and decorum. The old
      lady submitted to this piece of practical politeness with all the dignity
      which befitted so important and serious a solemnity, but the younger
      ladies, not being so thoroughly imbued with a superstitious veneration for
      the custom, or imagining that the value of a salute is very much enhanced
      if it cost a little trouble to obtain it, screamed and struggled, and ran
      into corners, and threatened and remonstrated, and did everything but
      leave the room, until some of the less adventurous gentlemen were on the
      point of desisting, when they all at once found it useless to resist any
      longer, and submitted to be kissed with a good grace. Mr. Winkle kissed
      the young lady with the black eyes, and Mr. Snodgrass kissed Emily; and
      Mr. Weller, not being particular about the form of being under the
      mistletoe, kissed Emma and the other female servants, just as he caught
      them. As to the poor relations, they kissed everybody, not even excepting
      the plainer portions of the young lady visitors, who, in their excessive
      confusion, ran right under the mistletoe, as soon as it was hung up,
      without knowing it! Wardle stood with his back to the fire, surveying the
      whole scene, with the utmost satisfaction; and the fat boy took the
      opportunity of appropriating to his own use, and summarily devouring, a
      particularly fine mince-pie, that had been carefully put by, for somebody
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the screaming had subsided, and faces were in a glow, and curls in a
      tangle, and Mr. Pickwick, after kissing the old lady as before mentioned,
      was standing under the mistletoe, looking with a very pleased countenance
      on all that was passing around him, when the young lady with the black
      eyes, after a little whispering with the other young ladies, made a sudden
      dart forward, and, putting her arm round Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s neck, saluted him
      affectionately on the left cheek; and before Mr. Pickwick distinctly knew
      what was the matter, he was surrounded by the whole body, and kissed by
      every one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pleasant thing to see Mr. Pickwick in the centre of the group,
      now pulled this way, and then that, and first kissed on the chin, and then
      on the nose, and then on the spectacles, and to hear the peals of laughter
      which were raised on every side; but it was a still more pleasant thing to
      see Mr. Pickwick, blinded shortly afterwards with a silk handkerchief,
      falling up against the wall, and scrambling into corners, and going
      through all the mysteries of blind-man&rsquo;s buff, with the utmost relish for
      the game, until at last he caught one of the poor relations, and then had
      to evade the blind-man himself, which he did with a nimbleness and agility
      that elicited the admiration and applause of all beholders. The poor
      relations caught the people who they thought would like it, and, when the
      game flagged, got caught themselves. When they all tired of blind-man&rsquo;s
      buff, there was a great game at snap-dragon, and when fingers enough were
      burned with that, and all the raisins were gone, they sat down by the huge
      fire of blazing logs to a substantial supper, and a mighty bowl of
      wassail, something smaller than an ordinary wash-house copper, in which
      the hot apples were hissing and bubbling with a rich look, and a jolly
      sound, that were perfectly irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking round him, &lsquo;this is, indeed, comfort.&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Our invariable custom,&rsquo; replied Mr. Wardle. &lsquo;Everybody sits down with us
      on Christmas Eve, as you see them now&mdash;servants and all; and here we
      wait, until the clock strikes twelve, to usher Christmas in, and beguile
      the time with forfeits and old stories. Trundle, my boy, rake up the
      fire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Up flew the bright sparks in myriads as the logs were stirred. The deep
      red blaze sent forth a rich glow, that penetrated into the farthest corner
      of the room, and cast its cheerful tint on every face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said Wardle, &lsquo;a song&mdash;a Christmas song! I&rsquo;ll give you one, in
      default of a better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bravo!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fill up,&rsquo; cried Wardle. &lsquo;It will be two hours, good, before you see the
      bottom of the bowl through the deep rich colour of the wassail; fill up
      all round, and now for the song.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus saying, the merry old gentleman, in a good, round, sturdy voice,
      commenced without more ado&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A CHRISTMAS CAROL

     &lsquo;I care not for Spring; on his fickle wing
     Let the blossoms and buds be borne;
     He woos them amain with his treacherous rain,
     And he scatters them ere the morn.
     An inconstant elf, he knows not himself,
     Nor his own changing mind an hour,
     He&rsquo;ll smile in your face, and, with wry grimace,
     He&rsquo;ll wither your youngest flower.

     &lsquo;Let the Summer sun to his bright home run,
     He shall never be sought by me;
     When he&rsquo;s dimmed by a cloud I can laugh aloud
     And care not how sulky he be!
     For his darling child is the madness wild
     That sports in fierce fever&rsquo;s train;
     And when love is too strong, it don&rsquo;t last long,
     As many have found to their pain.

     &lsquo;A mild harvest night, by the tranquil light
     Of the modest and gentle moon,
     Has a far sweeter sheen for me, I ween,
     Than the broad and unblushing noon.
     But every leaf awakens my grief,
     As it lieth beneath the tree;
     So let Autumn air be never so fair,
     It by no means agrees with me.

     &lsquo;But my song I troll out, for <i>Christmas </i>Stout,
     The hearty, the true, and the bold;
     A bumper I drain, and with might and main
     Give three cheers for this Christmas old!
     We&rsquo;ll usher him in with a merry din
     That shall gladden his joyous heart,
     And we&rsquo;ll keep him up, while there&rsquo;s bite or sup,
     And in fellowship good, we&rsquo;ll part.
     &lsquo;In his fine honest pride, he scorns to hide
     One jot of his hard-weather scars;
     They&rsquo;re no disgrace, for there&rsquo;s much the same trace
     On the cheeks of our bravest tars.
     Then again I sing till the roof doth ring
     And it echoes from wall to wall&mdash;
     To the stout old wight, fair welcome to-night,
     As the King of the Seasons all!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      This song was tumultuously applauded&mdash;for friends and dependents make
      a capital audience&mdash;and the poor relations, especially, were in
      perfect ecstasies of rapture. Again was the fire replenished, and again
      went the wassail round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How it snows!&rsquo; said one of the men, in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Snows, does it?&rsquo; said Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rough, cold night, Sir,&rsquo; replied the man; &lsquo;and there&rsquo;s a wind got up,
      that drifts it across the fields, in a thick white cloud.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does Jem say?&rsquo; inquired the old lady. &lsquo;There ain&rsquo;t anything the
      matter, is there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, mother,&rsquo; replied Wardle; &lsquo;he says there&rsquo;s a snowdrift, and a wind
      that&rsquo;s piercing cold. I should know that, by the way it rumbles in the
      chimney.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the old lady, &lsquo;there was just such a wind, and just such a fall
      of snow, a good many years back, I recollect&mdash;just five years before
      your poor father died. It was a Christmas Eve, too; and I remember that on
      that very night he told us the story about the goblins that carried away
      old Gabriel Grub.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The story about what?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, nothing, nothing,&rsquo; replied Wardle. &lsquo;About an old sexton, that the
      good people down here suppose to have been carried away by goblins.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose!&rsquo; ejaculated the old lady. &lsquo;Is there anybody hardy enough to
      disbelieve it? Suppose! Haven&rsquo;t you heard ever since you were a child,
      that he <i>was </i>carried away by the goblins, and don&rsquo;t you know he
      was?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, mother, he was, if you like,&rsquo; said Wardle laughing. &lsquo;He <i>was</i>
      carried away by goblins, Pickwick; and there&rsquo;s an end of the matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;not an end of it, I assure you; for I must
      hear how, and why, and all about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardle smiled, as every head was bent forward to hear, and filling out the
      wassail with no stinted hand, nodded a health to Mr. Pickwick, and began
      as follows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But bless our editorial heart, what a long chapter we have been betrayed
      into! We had quite forgotten all such petty restrictions as chapters, we
      solemnly declare. So here goes, to give the goblin a fair start in a new
      one. A clear stage and no favour for the goblins, ladies and gentlemen, if
      you please.

      CHAPTER XXIX. THE STORY OF THE GOBLINS WHO STOLE A SEXTON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&rsquo; I</span>n an old abbey
      town, down in this part of the country, a long, long while ago&mdash;so
      long, that the story must be a true one, because our great-grandfathers
      implicitly believed it&mdash;there officiated as sexton and grave-digger
      in the churchyard, one Gabriel Grub. It by no means follows that because a
      man is a sexton, and constantly surrounded by the emblems of mortality,
      therefore he should be a morose and melancholy man; your undertakers are
      the merriest fellows in the world; and I once had the honour of being on
      intimate terms with a mute, who in private life, and off duty, was as
      comical and jocose a little fellow as ever chirped out a devil-may-care
      song, without a hitch in his memory, or drained off a good stiff glass
      without stopping for breath. But notwithstanding these precedents to the
      contrary, Gabriel Grub was an ill-conditioned, cross-grained, surly fellow&mdash;a
      morose and lonely man, who consorted with nobody but himself, and an old
      wicker bottle which fitted into his large deep waistcoat pocket&mdash;and
      who eyed each merry face, as it passed him by, with such a deep scowl of
      malice and ill-humour, as it was difficult to meet without feeling
      something the worse for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little before twilight, one Christmas Eve, Gabriel shouldered his
      spade, lighted his lantern, and betook himself towards the old churchyard;
      for he had got a grave to finish by next morning, and, feeling very low,
      he thought it might raise his spirits, perhaps, if he went on with his
      work at once. As he went his way, up the ancient street, he saw the
      cheerful light of the blazing fires gleam through the old casements, and
      heard the loud laugh and the cheerful shouts of those who were assembled
      around them; he marked the bustling preparations for next day&rsquo;s cheer, and
      smelled the numerous savoury odours consequent thereupon, as they steamed
      up from the kitchen windows in clouds. All this was gall and wormwood to
      the heart of Gabriel Grub; and when groups of children bounded out of the
      houses, tripped across the road, and were met, before they could knock at
      the opposite door, by half a dozen curly-headed little rascals who crowded
      round them as they flocked upstairs to spend the evening in their
      Christmas games, Gabriel smiled grimly, and clutched the handle of his
      spade with a firmer grasp, as he thought of measles, scarlet fever,
      thrush, whooping-cough, and a good many other sources of consolation
      besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In this happy frame of mind, Gabriel strode along, returning a short,
      sullen growl to the good-humoured greetings of such of his neighbours as
      now and then passed him, until he turned into the dark lane which led to
      the churchyard. Now, Gabriel had been looking forward to reaching the dark
      lane, because it was, generally speaking, a nice, gloomy, mournful place,
      into which the townspeople did not much care to go, except in broad
      daylight, and when the sun was shining; consequently, he was not a little
      indignant to hear a young urchin roaring out some jolly song about a merry
      Christmas, in this very sanctuary which had been called Coffin Lane ever
      since the days of the old abbey, and the time of the shaven-headed monks.
      As Gabriel walked on, and the voice drew nearer, he found it proceeded
      from a small boy, who was hurrying along, to join one of the little
      parties in the old street, and who, partly to keep himself company, and
      partly to prepare himself for the occasion, was shouting out the song at
      the highest pitch of his lungs. So Gabriel waited until the boy came up,
      and then dodged him into a corner, and rapped him over the head with his
      lantern five or six times, just to teach him to modulate his voice. And as
      the boy hurried away with his hand to his head, singing quite a different
      sort of tune, Gabriel Grub chuckled very heartily to himself, and entered
      the churchyard, locking the gate behind him.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

      <a href="images/0546.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He took off his coat, set down his lantern, and getting into the
      unfinished grave, worked at it for an hour or so with right good-will. But
      the earth was hardened with the frost, and it was no very easy matter to
      break it up, and shovel it out; and although there was a moon, it was a
      very young one, and shed little light upon the grave, which was in the
      shadow of the church. At any other time, these obstacles would have made
      Gabriel Grub very moody and miserable, but he was so well pleased with
      having stopped the small boy&rsquo;s singing, that he took little heed of the
      scanty progress he had made, and looked down into the grave, when he had
      finished work for the night, with grim satisfaction, murmuring as he
      gathered up his things&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Brave lodgings for one, brave lodgings for one,
     A few feet of cold earth, when life is done;
     A stone at the head, a stone at the feet,
     A rich, juicy meal for the worms to eat;
     Rank grass overhead, and damp clay around,
     Brave lodgings for one, these, in holy ground!
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; laughed Gabriel Grub, as he sat himself down on a flat
      tombstone which was a favourite resting-place of his, and drew forth his
      wicker bottle. &ldquo;A coffin at Christmas! A Christmas box! Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo; repeated a voice which sounded close behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gabriel paused, in some alarm, in the act of raising the wicker bottle to
      his lips, and looked round. The bottom of the oldest grave about him was
      not more still and quiet than the churchyard in the pale moonlight. The
      cold hoar frost glistened on the tombstones, and sparkled like rows of
      gems, among the stone carvings of the old church. The snow lay hard and
      crisp upon the ground; and spread over the thickly-strewn mounds of earth,
      so white and smooth a cover that it seemed as if corpses lay there, hidden
      only by their winding sheets. Not the faintest rustle broke the profound
      tranquillity of the solemn scene. Sound itself appeared to be frozen up,
      all was so cold and still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;It was the echoes,&rdquo; said Gabriel Grub, raising the bottle to his lips
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;It was <i>not</i>,&rdquo; said a deep voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gabriel started up, and stood rooted to the spot with astonishment and
      terror; for his eyes rested on a form that made his blood run cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seated on an upright tombstone, close to him, was a strange, unearthly
      figure, whom Gabriel felt at once, was no being of this world. His long,
      fantastic legs which might have reached the ground, were cocked up, and
      crossed after a quaint, fantastic fashion; his sinewy arms were bare; and
      his hands rested on his knees. On his short, round body, he wore a close
      covering, ornamented with small slashes; a short cloak dangled at his
      back; the collar was cut into curious peaks, which served the goblin in
      lieu of ruff or neckerchief; and his shoes curled up at his toes into long
      points. On his head, he wore a broad-brimmed sugar-loaf hat, garnished
      with a single feather. The hat was covered with the white frost; and the
      goblin looked as if he had sat on the same tombstone very comfortably, for
      two or three hundred years. He was sitting perfectly still; his tongue was
      put out, as if in derision; and he was grinning at Gabriel Grub with such
      a grin as only a goblin could call up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;It was <i>not </i>the echoes,&rdquo; said the goblin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gabriel Grub was paralysed, and could make no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What do you do here on Christmas Eve?&rdquo; said the goblin sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I came to dig a grave, Sir,&rdquo; stammered Gabriel Grub.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What man wanders among graves and churchyards on such a night as this?&rdquo;
       cried the goblin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Gabriel Grub! Gabriel Grub!&rdquo; screamed a wild chorus of voices that
      seemed to fill the churchyard. Gabriel looked fearfully round&mdash;nothing
      was to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What have you got in that bottle?&rdquo; said the goblin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Hollands, sir,&rdquo; replied the sexton, trembling more than ever; for he had
      bought it of the smugglers, and he thought that perhaps his questioner
      might be in the excise department of the goblins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Who drinks Hollands alone, and in a churchyard, on such a night as
      this?&rdquo; said the goblin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Gabriel Grub! Gabriel Grub!&rdquo; exclaimed the wild voices again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The goblin leered maliciously at the terrified sexton, and then raising
      his voice, exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;And who, then, is our fair and lawful prize?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To this inquiry the invisible chorus replied, in a strain that sounded
      like the voices of many choristers singing to the mighty swell of the old
      church organ&mdash;a strain that seemed borne to the sexton&rsquo;s ears upon a
      wild wind, and to die away as it passed onward; but the burden of the
      reply was still the same, &ldquo;Gabriel Grub! Gabriel Grub!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The goblin grinned a broader grin than before, as he said, &ldquo;Well,
      Gabriel, what do you say to this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The sexton gasped for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What do you think of this, Gabriel?&rdquo; said the goblin, kicking up his
      feet in the air on either side of the tombstone, and looking at the
      turned-up points with as much complacency as if he had been contemplating
      the most fashionable pair of Wellingtons in all Bond Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;very curious, Sir,&rdquo; replied the sexton, half dead
      with fright; &ldquo;very curious, and very pretty, but I think I&rsquo;ll go back and
      finish my work, Sir, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Work!&rdquo; said the goblin, &ldquo;what work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;The grave, Sir; making the grave,&rdquo; stammered the sexton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, the grave, eh?&rdquo; said the goblin; &ldquo;who makes graves at a time when
      all other men are merry, and takes a pleasure in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Again the mysterious voices replied, &ldquo;Gabriel Grub! Gabriel Grub!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I am afraid my friends want you, Gabriel,&rdquo; said the goblin, thrusting
      his tongue farther into his cheek than ever&mdash;and a most astonishing
      tongue it was&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid my friends want you, Gabriel,&rdquo; said the
      goblin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Under favour, Sir,&rdquo; replied the horror-stricken sexton, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
      they can, Sir; they don&rsquo;t know me, Sir; I don&rsquo;t think the gentlemen have
      ever seen me, Sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, yes, they have,&rdquo; replied the goblin; &ldquo;we know the man with the sulky
      face and grim scowl, that came down the street to-night, throwing his evil
      looks at the children, and grasping his burying-spade the tighter. We know
      the man who struck the boy in the envious malice of his heart, because the
      boy could be merry, and he could not. We know him, we know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, the goblin gave a loud, shrill laugh, which the echoes returned
      twentyfold; and throwing his legs up in the air, stood upon his head, or
      rather upon the very point of his sugar-loaf hat, on the narrow edge of
      the tombstone, whence he threw a Somerset with extraordinary agility,
      right to the sexton&rsquo;s feet, at which he planted himself in the attitude in
      which tailors generally sit upon the shop-board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;am afraid I must leave you, Sir,&rdquo; said the sexton,
      making an effort to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Leave us!&rdquo; said the goblin, &ldquo;Gabriel Grub going to leave us. Ho! ho!
      ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As the goblin laughed, the sexton observed, for one instant, a brilliant
      illumination within the windows of the church, as if the whole building
      were lighted up; it disappeared, the organ pealed forth a lively air, and
      whole troops of goblins, the very counterpart of the first one, poured
      into the churchyard, and began playing at leap-frog with the tombstones,
      never stopping for an instant to take breath, but &ldquo;overing&rdquo; the highest
      among them, one after the other, with the most marvellous dexterity. The
      first goblin was a most astonishing leaper, and none of the others could
      come near him; even in the extremity of his terror the sexton could not
      help observing, that while his friends were content to leap over the
      common-sized gravestones, the first one took the family vaults, iron
      railings and all, with as much ease as if they had been so many
      street-posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At last the game reached to a most exciting pitch; the organ played
      quicker and quicker, and the goblins leaped faster and faster, coiling
      themselves up, rolling head over heels upon the ground, and bounding over
      the tombstones like footballs. The sexton&rsquo;s brain whirled round with the
      rapidity of the motion he beheld, and his legs reeled beneath him, as the
      spirits flew before his eyes; when the goblin king, suddenly darting
      towards him, laid his hand upon his collar, and sank with him through the
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When Gabriel Grub had had time to fetch his breath, which the rapidity of
      his descent had for the moment taken away, he found himself in what
      appeared to be a large cavern, surrounded on all sides by crowds of
      goblins, ugly and grim; in the centre of the room, on an elevated seat,
      was stationed his friend of the churchyard; and close behind him stood
      Gabriel Grub himself, without power of motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Cold to-night,&rdquo; said the king of the goblins, &ldquo;very cold. A glass of
      something warm here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At this command, half a dozen officious goblins, with a perpetual smile
      upon their faces, whom Gabriel Grub imagined to be courtiers, on that
      account, hastily disappeared, and presently returned with a goblet of
      liquid fire, which they presented to the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried the goblin, whose cheeks and throat were transparent, as he
      tossed down the flame, &ldquo;this warms one, indeed! Bring a bumper of the
      same, for Mr. Grub.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was in vain for the unfortunate sexton to protest that he was not in
      the habit of taking anything warm at night; one of the goblins held him
      while another poured the blazing liquid down his throat; the whole
      assembly screeched with laughter, as he coughed and choked, and wiped away
      the tears which gushed plentifully from his eyes, after swallowing the
      burning draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the king, fantastically poking the taper corner of his
      sugar-loaf hat into the sexton&rsquo;s eye, and thereby occasioning him the most
      exquisite pain; &ldquo;and now, show the man of misery and gloom, a few of the
      pictures from our own great storehouse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As the goblin said this, a thick cloud which obscured the remoter end of
      the cavern rolled gradually away, and disclosed, apparently at a great
      distance, a small and scantily furnished, but neat and clean apartment. A
      crowd of little children were gathered round a bright fire, clinging to
      their mother&rsquo;s gown, and gambolling around her chair. The mother
      occasionally rose, and drew aside the window-curtain, as if to look for
      some expected object; a frugal meal was ready spread upon the table; and
      an elbow chair was placed near the fire. A knock was heard at the door;
      the mother opened it, and the children crowded round her, and clapped
      their hands for joy, as their father entered. He was wet and weary, and
      shook the snow from his garments, as the children crowded round him, and
      seizing his cloak, hat, stick, and gloves, with busy zeal, ran with them
      from the room. Then, as he sat down to his meal before the fire, the
      children climbed about his knee, and the mother sat by his side, and all
      seemed happiness and comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But a change came upon the view, almost imperceptibly. The scene was
      altered to a small bedroom, where the fairest and youngest child lay
      dying; the roses had fled from his cheek, and the light from his eye; and
      even as the sexton looked upon him with an interest he had never felt or
      known before, he died. His young brothers and sisters crowded round his
      little bed, and seized his tiny hand, so cold and heavy; but they shrank
      back from its touch, and looked with awe on his infant face; for calm and
      tranquil as it was, and sleeping in rest and peace as the beautiful child
      seemed to be, they saw that he was dead, and they knew that he was an
      angel looking down upon, and blessing them, from a bright and happy
      Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Again the light cloud passed across the picture, and again the subject
      changed. The father and mother were old and helpless now, and the number
      of those about them was diminished more than half; but content and
      cheerfulness sat on every face, and beamed in every eye, as they crowded
      round the fireside, and told and listened to old stories of earlier and
      bygone days. Slowly and peacefully, the father sank into the grave, and,
      soon after, the sharer of all his cares and troubles followed him to a
      place of rest. The few who yet survived them, kneeled by their tomb, and
      watered the green turf which covered it with their tears; then rose, and
      turned away, sadly and mournfully, but not with bitter cries, or
      despairing lamentations, for they knew that they should one day meet
      again; and once more they mixed with the busy world, and their content and
      cheerfulness were restored. The cloud settled upon the picture, and
      concealed it from the sexton&rsquo;s view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What do you think of <i>that</i>?&rdquo; said the goblin, turning his large
      face towards Gabriel Grub.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gabriel murmured out something about its being very pretty, and looked
      somewhat ashamed, as the goblin bent his fiery eyes upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You a miserable man!&rdquo; said the goblin, in a tone of excessive contempt.
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; He appeared disposed to add more, but indignation choked his
      utterance, so he lifted up one of his very pliable legs, and, flourishing
      it above his head a little, to insure his aim, administered a good sound
      kick to Gabriel Grub; immediately after which, all the goblins in waiting
      crowded round the wretched sexton, and kicked him without mercy, according
      to the established and invariable custom of courtiers upon earth, who kick
      whom royalty kicks, and hug whom royalty hugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Show him some more!&rdquo; said the king of the goblins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At these words, the cloud was dispelled, and a rich and beautiful
      landscape was disclosed to view&mdash;there is just such another, to this
      day, within half a mile of the old abbey town. The sun shone from out the
      clear blue sky, the water sparkled beneath his rays, and the trees looked
      greener, and the flowers more gay, beneath its cheering influence. The
      water rippled on with a pleasant sound, the trees rustled in the light
      wind that murmured among their leaves, the birds sang upon the boughs, and
      the lark carolled on high her welcome to the morning. Yes, it was morning;
      the bright, balmy morning of summer; the minutest leaf, the smallest blade
      of grass, was instinct with life. The ant crept forth to her daily toil,
      the butterfly fluttered and basked in the warm rays of the sun; myriads of
      insects spread their transparent wings, and revelled in their brief but
      happy existence. Man walked forth, elated with the scene; and all was
      brightness and splendour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;<i>You </i>a miserable man!&rdquo; said the king of the goblins, in a more
      contemptuous tone than before. And again the king of the goblins gave his
      leg a flourish; again it descended on the shoulders of the sexton; and
      again the attendant goblins imitated the example of their chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Many a time the cloud went and came, and many a lesson it taught to
      Gabriel Grub, who, although his shoulders smarted with pain from the
      frequent applications of the goblins&rsquo; feet thereunto, looked on with an
      interest that nothing could diminish. He saw that men who worked hard, and
      earned their scanty bread with lives of labour, were cheerful and happy;
      and that to the most ignorant, the sweet face of Nature was a
      never-failing source of cheerfulness and joy. He saw those who had been
      delicately nurtured, and tenderly brought up, cheerful under privations,
      and superior to suffering, that would have crushed many of a rougher
      grain, because they bore within their own bosoms the materials of
      happiness, contentment, and peace. He saw that women, the tenderest and
      most fragile of all God&rsquo;s creatures, were the oftenest superior to sorrow,
      adversity, and distress; and he saw that it was because they bore, in
      their own hearts, an inexhaustible well-spring of affection and devotion.
      Above all, he saw that men like himself, who snarled at the mirth and
      cheerfulness of others, were the foulest weeds on the fair surface of the
      earth; and setting all the good of the world against the evil, he came to
      the conclusion that it was a very decent and respectable sort of world
      after all. No sooner had he formed it, than the cloud which had closed
      over the last picture, seemed to settle on his senses, and lull him to
      repose. One by one, the goblins faded from his sight; and, as the last one
      disappeared, he sank to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The day had broken when Gabriel Grub awoke, and found himself lying at
      full length on the flat gravestone in the churchyard, with the wicker
      bottle lying empty by his side, and his coat, spade, and lantern, all well
      whitened by the last night&rsquo;s frost, scattered on the ground. The stone on
      which he had first seen the goblin seated, stood bolt upright before him,
      and the grave at which he had worked, the night before, was not far off.
      At first, he began to doubt the reality of his adventures, but the acute
      pain in his shoulders when he attempted to rise, assured him that the
      kicking of the goblins was certainly not ideal. He was staggered again, by
      observing no traces of footsteps in the snow on which the goblins had
      played at leap-frog with the gravestones, but he speedily accounted for
      this circumstance when he remembered that, being spirits, they would leave
      no visible impression behind them. So, Gabriel Grub got on his feet as
      well as he could, for the pain in his back; and, brushing the frost off
      his coat, put it on, and turned his face towards the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he was an altered man, and he could not bear the thought of returning
      to a place where his repentance would be scoffed at, and his reformation
      disbelieved. He hesitated for a few moments; and then turned away to
      wander where he might, and seek his bread elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The lantern, the spade, and the wicker bottle were found, that day, in
      the churchyard. There were a great many speculations about the sexton&rsquo;s
      fate, at first, but it was speedily determined that he had been carried
      away by the goblins; and there were not wanting some very credible
      witnesses who had distinctly seen him whisked through the air on the back
      of a chestnut horse blind of one eye, with the hind-quarters of a lion,
      and the tail of a bear. At length all this was devoutly believed; and the
      new sexton used to exhibit to the curious, for a trifling emolument, a
      good-sized piece of the church weathercock which had been accidentally
      kicked off by the aforesaid horse in his aerial flight, and picked up by
      himself in the churchyard, a year or two afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unfortunately, these stories were somewhat disturbed by the unlooked-for
      reappearance of Gabriel Grub himself, some ten years afterwards, a ragged,
      contented, rheumatic old man. He told his story to the clergyman, and also
      to the mayor; and in course of time it began to be received as a matter of
      history, in which form it has continued down to this very day. The
      believers in the weathercock tale, having misplaced their confidence once,
      were not easily prevailed upon to part with it again, so they looked as
      wise as they could, shrugged their shoulders, touched their foreheads, and
      murmured something about Gabriel Grub having drunk all the Hollands, and
      then fallen asleep on the flat tombstone; and they affected to explain
      what he supposed he had witnessed in the goblin&rsquo;s cavern, by saying that
      he had seen the world, and grown wiser. But this opinion, which was by no
      means a popular one at any time, gradually died off; and be the matter how
      it may, as Gabriel Grub was afflicted with rheumatism to the end of his
      days, this story has at least one moral, if it teach no better one&mdash;and
      that is, that if a man turn sulky and drink by himself at Christmas time,
      he may make up his mind to be not a bit the better for it: let the spirits
      be never so good, or let them be even as many degrees beyond proof, as
      those which Gabriel Grub saw in the goblin&rsquo;s cavern.&rsquo;

      CHAPTER XXX. HOW THE PICKWICKIANS MADE AND CULTIVATED THE ACQUAINTANCE OF
      A COUPLE OF NICE YOUNG MEN BELONGING TO ONE OF THE LIBERAL PROFESSIONS;
      HOW THEY DISPORTED THEMSELVES ON THE ICE; AND HOW THEIR VISIT CAME TO A
      CONCLUSION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ell, Sam,&rsquo; said
      Mr. Pickwick, as that favoured servitor entered his bed-chamber, with his
      warm water, on the morning of Christmas Day, &lsquo;still frosty?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Water in the wash-hand basin&rsquo;s a mask o&rsquo; ice, Sir,&rsquo; responded Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Severe weather, Sam,&rsquo; observed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fine time for them as is well wropped up, as the Polar bear said to
      himself, ven he was practising his skating,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be down in a quarter of an hour, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, untying
      his nightcap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good, sir,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a couple o&rsquo; sawbones downstairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A couple of what!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, sitting up in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A couple o&rsquo; sawbones,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s a sawbones?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, not quite certain whether it
      was a live animal, or something to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! Don&rsquo;t you know what a sawbones is, sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller. &lsquo;I
      thought everybody know&rsquo;d as a sawbones was a surgeon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, a surgeon, eh?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just that, sir,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;These here ones as is below, though, ain&rsquo;t
      reg&rsquo;lar thoroughbred sawbones; they&rsquo;re only in trainin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words they&rsquo;re medical students, I suppose?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam Weller nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad of it,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, casting his nightcap energetically
      on the counterpane. &lsquo;They are fine fellows&mdash;very fine fellows; with
      judgments matured by observation and reflection; and tastes refined by
      reading and study. I am very glad of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re a-smokin&rsquo; cigars by the kitchen fire,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; observed Mr. Pickwick, rubbing his hands, &lsquo;overflowing with kindly
      feelings and animal spirits. Just what I like to see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And one on &lsquo;em,&rsquo; said Sam, not noticing his master&rsquo;s interruption, &lsquo;one on
      &lsquo;em&rsquo;s got his legs on the table, and is a-drinking brandy neat, vile the
      t&rsquo;other one&mdash;him in the barnacles&mdash;has got a barrel o&rsquo; oysters
      atween his knees, which he&rsquo;s a-openin&rsquo; like steam, and as fast as he eats
      &lsquo;em, he takes a aim vith the shells at young dropsy, who&rsquo;s a sittin&rsquo; down
      fast asleep, in the chimbley corner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eccentricities of genius, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;You may retire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam did retire accordingly. Mr. Pickwick at the expiration of the quarter
      of an hour, went down to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here he is at last!&rsquo; said old Mr. Wardle. &lsquo;Pickwick, this is Miss Allen&rsquo;s
      brother, Mr. Benjamin Allen. Ben we call him, and so may you, if you like.
      This gentleman is his very particular friend, Mr.&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Bob Sawyer,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Benjamin Allen; whereupon Mr. Bob Sawyer
      and Mr. Benjamin Allen laughed in concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick bowed to Bob Sawyer, and Bob Sawyer bowed to Mr. Pickwick.
      Bob and his very particular friend then applied themselves most
      assiduously to the eatables before them; and Mr. Pickwick had an
      opportunity of glancing at them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Benjamin Allen was a coarse, stout, thick-set young man, with black
      hair cut rather short, and a white face cut rather long. He was
      embellished with spectacles, and wore a white neckerchief. Below his
      single-breasted black surtout, which was buttoned up to his chin, appeared
      the usual number of pepper-and-salt coloured legs, terminating in a pair
      of imperfectly polished boots. Although his coat was short in the sleeves,
      it disclosed no vestige of a linen wristband; and although there was quite
      enough of his face to admit of the encroachment of a shirt collar, it was
      not graced by the smallest approach to that appendage. He presented,
      altogether, rather a mildewy appearance, and emitted a fragrant odour of
      full-flavoured Cubas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bob Sawyer, who was habited in a coarse, blue coat, which, without
      being either a greatcoat or a surtout, partook of the nature and qualities
      of both, had about him that sort of slovenly smartness, and swaggering
      gait, which is peculiar to young gentlemen who smoke in the streets by
      day, shout and scream in the same by night, call waiters by their
      Christian names, and do various other acts and deeds of an equally
      facetious description. He wore a pair of plaid trousers, and a large,
      rough, double-breasted waistcoat; out of doors, he carried a thick stick
      with a big top. He eschewed gloves, and looked, upon the whole, something
      like a dissipated Robinson Crusoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the two worthies to whom Mr. Pickwick was introduced, as he took
      his seat at the breakfast-table on Christmas morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Splendid morning, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bob Sawyer slightly nodded his assent to the proposition, and asked
      Mr. Benjamin Allen for the mustard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you come far this morning, gentlemen?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Blue Lion at Muggleton,&rsquo; briefly responded Mr. Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should have joined us last night,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So we should,&rsquo; replied Bob Sawyer, &lsquo;but the brandy was too good to leave
      in a hurry; wasn&rsquo;t it, Ben?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said Mr. Benjamin Allen; &lsquo;and the cigars were not bad, or the
      pork-chops either; were they, Bob?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Decidedly not,&rsquo; said Bob. The particular friends resumed their attack
      upon the breakfast, more freely than before, as if the recollection of
      last night&rsquo;s supper had imparted a new relish to the meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peg away, Bob,&rsquo; said Mr. Allen, to his companion, encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I do,&rsquo; replied Bob Sawyer. And so, to do him justice, he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing like dissecting, to give one an appetite,&rsquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer,
      looking round the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick slightly shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the bye, Bob,&rsquo; said Mr. Allen, &lsquo;have you finished that leg yet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nearly,&rsquo; replied Sawyer, helping himself to half a fowl as he spoke.
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a very muscular one for a child&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Allen carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very,&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer, with his mouth full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve put my name down for an arm at our place,&rsquo; said Mr. Allen. &lsquo;We&rsquo;re
      clubbing for a subject, and the list is nearly full, only we can&rsquo;t get
      hold of any fellow that wants a head. I wish you&rsquo;d take it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied &lsquo;Bob Sawyer; &lsquo;can&rsquo;t afford expensive luxuries.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; said Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t, indeed,&rsquo; rejoined Bob Sawyer, &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind a brain, but I
      couldn&rsquo;t stand a whole head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hush, hush, gentlemen, pray,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I hear the ladies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Pickwick spoke, the ladies, gallantly escorted by Messrs.
      Snodgrass, Winkle, and Tupman, returned from an early walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Ben!&rsquo; said Arabella, in a tone which expressed more surprise than
      pleasure at the sight of her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come to take you home to-morrow,&rsquo; replied Benjamin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see Bob Sawyer, Arabella?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Benjamin Allen,
      somewhat reproachfully. Arabella gracefully held out her hand, in
      acknowledgment of Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s presence. A thrill of hatred struck to Mr.
      Winkle&rsquo;s heart, as Bob Sawyer inflicted on the proffered hand a
      perceptible squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ben, dear!&rsquo; said Arabella, blushing; &lsquo;have&mdash;have&mdash;you been
      introduced to Mr. Winkle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not been, but I shall be very happy to be, Arabella,&rsquo; replied her
      brother gravely. Here Mr. Allen bowed grimly to Mr. Winkle, while Mr.
      Winkle and Mr. Bob Sawyer glanced mutual distrust out of the corners of
      their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrival of the two new visitors, and the consequent check upon Mr.
      Winkle and the young lady with the fur round her boots, would in all
      probability have proved a very unpleasant interruption to the hilarity of
      the party, had not the cheerfulness of Mr. Pickwick, and the good humour
      of the host, been exerted to the very utmost for the common weal. Mr.
      Winkle gradually insinuated himself into the good graces of Mr. Benjamin
      Allen, and even joined in a friendly conversation with Mr. Bob Sawyer;
      who, enlivened with the brandy, and the breakfast, and the talking,
      gradually ripened into a state of extreme facetiousness, and related with
      much glee an agreeable anecdote, about the removal of a tumour on some
      gentleman&rsquo;s head, which he illustrated by means of an oyster-knife and a
      half-quartern loaf, to the great edification of the assembled company.
      Then the whole train went to church, where Mr. Benjamin Allen fell fast
      asleep; while Mr. Bob Sawyer abstracted his thoughts from worldly matters,
      by the ingenious process of carving his name on the seat of the pew, in
      corpulent letters of four inches long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Wardle, after a substantial lunch, with the agreeable items of
      strong beer and cherry-brandy, had been done ample justice to, &lsquo;what say
      you to an hour on the ice? We shall have plenty of time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Capital!&rsquo; said Mr. Benjamin Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Prime!&rsquo; ejaculated Mr. Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You skate, of course, Winkle?&rsquo; said Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye-yes; oh, yes,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle. &lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;am <i>rather </i>out
      of practice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, <i>do</i> skate, Mr. Winkle,&rsquo; said Arabella. &lsquo;I like to see it so
      much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it is <i>so</i> graceful,&rsquo; said another young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third young lady said it was elegant, and a fourth expressed her opinion
      that it was &lsquo;swan-like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be very happy, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, reddening; &lsquo;but I
      have no skates.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This objection was at once overruled. Trundle had a couple of pair, and
      the fat boy announced that there were half a dozen more downstairs;
      whereat Mr. Winkle expressed exquisite delight, and looked exquisitely
      uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Wardle led the way to a pretty large sheet of ice; and the fat boy and
      Mr. Weller, having shovelled and swept away the snow which had fallen on
      it during the night, Mr. Bob Sawyer adjusted his skates with a dexterity
      which to Mr. Winkle was perfectly marvellous, and described circles with
      his left leg, and cut figures of eight, and inscribed upon the ice,
      without once stopping for breath, a great many other pleasant and
      astonishing devices, to the excessive satisfaction of Mr. Pickwick, Mr.
      Tupman, and the ladies; which reached a pitch of positive enthusiasm, when
      old Wardle and Benjamin Allen, assisted by the aforesaid Bob Sawyer,
      performed some mystic evolutions, which they called a reel.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time, Mr. Winkle, with his face and hands blue with the cold, had
      been forcing a gimlet into the sole of his feet, and putting his skates
      on, with the points behind, and getting the straps into a very complicated
      and entangled state, with the assistance of Mr. Snodgrass, who knew rather
      less about skates than a Hindoo. At length, however, with the assistance
      of Mr. Weller, the unfortunate skates were firmly screwed and buckled on,
      and Mr. Winkle was raised to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, then, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam, in an encouraging tone; &lsquo;off vith you, and
      show &lsquo;em how to do it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop, Sam, stop!&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, trembling violently, and clutching
      hold of Sam&rsquo;s arms with the grasp of a drowning man. &lsquo;How slippery it is,
      Sam!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not an uncommon thing upon ice, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Hold up, Sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This last observation of Mr. Weller&rsquo;s bore reference to a demonstration
      Mr. Winkle made at the instant, of a frantic desire to throw his feet in
      the air, and dash the back of his head on the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These&mdash;these&mdash;are very awkward skates; ain&rsquo;t they, Sam?&rsquo; 
      inquired Mr. Winkle, staggering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afeerd there&rsquo;s a orkard gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n in &lsquo;em, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Winkle,&rsquo; cried Mr. Pickwick, quite unconscious that there was
      anything the matter. &lsquo;Come; the ladies are all anxiety.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle, with a ghastly smile. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m coming.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just a-goin&rsquo; to begin,&rsquo; said Sam, endeavouring to disengage himself.
      &lsquo;Now, Sir, start off!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop an instant, Sam,&rsquo; gasped Mr. Winkle, clinging most affectionately to
      Mr. Weller. &lsquo;I find I&rsquo;ve got a couple of coats at home that I don&rsquo;t want,
      Sam. You may have them, Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind touching your hat, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle hastily. &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t
      take your hand away to do that. I meant to have given you five shillings
      this morning for a Christmas box, Sam. I&rsquo;ll give it you this afternoon,
      Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re wery good, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just hold me at first, Sam; will you?&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle. &lsquo;There&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      right. I shall soon get in the way of it, Sam. Not too fast, Sam; not too
      fast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle, stooping forward, with his body half doubled up, was being
      assisted over the ice by Mr. Weller, in a very singular and un-swan-like
      manner, when Mr. Pickwick most innocently shouted from the opposite bank&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here. I want you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let go, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear the governor a-callin&rsquo;? Let go,
      sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With a violent effort, Mr. Weller disengaged himself from the grasp of the
      agonised Pickwickian, and, in so doing, administered a considerable
      impetus to the unhappy Mr. Winkle. With an accuracy which no degree of
      dexterity or practice could have insured, that unfortunate gentleman bore
      swiftly down into the centre of the reel, at the very moment when Mr. Bob
      Sawyer was performing a flourish of unparalleled beauty. Mr. Winkle struck
      wildly against him, and with a loud crash they both fell heavily down. Mr.
      Pickwick ran to the spot. Bob Sawyer had risen to his feet, but Mr. Winkle
      was far too wise to do anything of the kind, in skates. He was seated on
      the ice, making spasmodic efforts to smile; but anguish was depicted on
      every lineament of his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you hurt?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Benjamin Allen, with great anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not much,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, rubbing his back very hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you&rsquo;d let me bleed you,&rsquo; said Mr. Benjamin, with great eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really think you had better,&rsquo; said Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle; &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do <i>you </i>think, Mr. Pickwick?&rsquo; inquired Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was excited and indignant. He beckoned to Mr. Weller, and
      said in a stern voice, &lsquo;Take his skates off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; but really I had scarcely begun,&rsquo; remonstrated Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take his skates off,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Pickwick firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The command was not to be resisted. Mr. Winkle allowed Sam to obey it, in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lift him up,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. Sam assisted him to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick retired a few paces apart from the bystanders; and, beckoning
      his friend to approach, fixed a searching look upon him, and uttered in a
      low, but distinct and emphatic tone, these remarkable words&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a humbug, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A what?&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A humbug, Sir. I will speak plainer, if you wish it. An impostor, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With those words, Mr. Pickwick turned slowly on his heel, and rejoined his
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mr. Pickwick was delivering himself of the sentiment just recorded,
      Mr. Weller and the fat boy, having by their joint endeavours cut out a
      slide, were exercising themselves thereupon, in a very masterly and
      brilliant manner. Sam Weller, in particular, was displaying that beautiful
      feat of fancy-sliding which is currently denominated &lsquo;knocking at the
      cobbler&rsquo;s door,&rsquo; and which is achieved by skimming over the ice on one
      foot, and occasionally giving a postman&rsquo;s knock upon it with the other. It
      was a good long slide, and there was something in the motion which Mr.
      Pickwick, who was very cold with standing still, could not help envying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It looks a nice warm exercise that, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; he inquired of Wardle,
      when that gentleman was thoroughly out of breath, by reason of the
      indefatigable manner in which he had converted his legs into a pair of
      compasses, and drawn complicated problems on the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, it does, indeed,&rsquo; replied Wardle. &lsquo;Do you slide?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I used to do so, on the gutters, when I was a boy,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Try it now,&rsquo; said Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, do, please, Mr. Pickwick!&rsquo; cried all the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be very happy to afford you any amusement,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Pickwick, &lsquo;but I haven&rsquo;t done such a thing these thirty years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pooh! pooh! Nonsense!&rsquo; said Wardle, dragging off his skates with the
      impetuosity which characterised all his proceedings. &lsquo;Here; I&rsquo;ll keep you
      company; come along!&rsquo; And away went the good-tempered old fellow down the
      slide, with a rapidity which came very close upon Mr. Weller, and beat the
      fat boy all to nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick paused, considered, pulled off his gloves and put them in his
      hat; took two or three short runs, baulked himself as often, and at last
      took another run, and went slowly and gravely down the slide, with his
      feet about a yard and a quarter apart, amidst the gratified shouts of all
      the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep the pot a-bilin&rsquo;, Sir!&rsquo; said Sam; and down went Wardle again, and
      then Mr. Pickwick, and then Sam, and then Mr. Winkle, and then Mr. Bob
      Sawyer, and then the fat boy, and then Mr. Snodgrass, following closely
      upon each other&rsquo;s heels, and running after each other with as much
      eagerness as if their future prospects in life depended on their
      expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the most intensely interesting thing, to observe the manner in
      which Mr. Pickwick performed his share in the ceremony; to watch the
      torture of anxiety with which he viewed the person behind, gaining upon
      him at the imminent hazard of tripping him up; to see him gradually expend
      the painful force he had put on at first, and turn slowly round on the
      slide, with his face towards the point from which he had started; to
      contemplate the playful smile which mantled on his face when he had
      accomplished the distance, and the eagerness with which he turned round
      when he had done so, and ran after his predecessor, his black gaiters
      tripping pleasantly through the snow, and his eyes beaming cheerfulness
      and gladness through his spectacles. And when he was knocked down (which
      happened upon the average every third round), it was the most invigorating
      sight that can possibly be imagined, to behold him gather up his hat,
      gloves, and handkerchief, with a glowing countenance, and resume his
      station in the rank, with an ardour and enthusiasm that nothing Could
      abate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sport was at its height, the sliding was at the quickest, the laughter
      was at the loudest, when a sharp smart crack was heard. There was a quick
      rush towards the bank, a wild scream from the ladies, and a shout from Mr.
      Tupman. A large mass of ice disappeared; the water bubbled up over it; Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s hat, gloves, and handkerchief were floating on the surface; and
      this was all of Mr. Pickwick that anybody could see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dismay and anguish were depicted on every countenance; the males turned
      pale, and the females fainted; Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle grasped each
      other by the hand, and gazed at the spot where their leader had gone down,
      with frenzied eagerness; while Mr. Tupman, by way of rendering the
      promptest assistance, and at the same time conveying to any persons who
      might be within hearing, the clearest possible notion of the catastrophe,
      ran off across the country at his utmost speed, screaming &lsquo;Fire!&rsquo; with all
      his might.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment, when old Wardle and Sam Weller were approaching the
      hole with cautious steps, and Mr. Benjamin Allen was holding a hurried
      consultation with Mr. Bob Sawyer on the advisability of bleeding the
      company generally, as an improving little bit of professional practice&mdash;it
      was at this very moment, that a face, head, and shoulders, emerged from
      beneath the water, and disclosed the features and spectacles of Mr.
      Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep yourself up for an instant&mdash;for only one instant!&rsquo; bawled Mr.
      Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, do; let me implore you&mdash;for my sake!&rsquo; roared Mr. Winkle, deeply
      affected. The adjuration was rather unnecessary; the probability being,
      that if Mr. Pickwick had declined to keep himself up for anybody else&rsquo;s
      sake, it would have occurred to him that he might as well do so, for his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you feel the bottom there, old fellow?&rsquo; said Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, certainly,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, wringing the water from his head
      and face, and gasping for breath. &lsquo;I fell upon my back. I couldn&rsquo;t get on
      my feet at first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The clay upon so much of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s coat as was yet visible, bore
      testimony to the accuracy of this statement; and as the fears of the
      spectators were still further relieved by the fat boy&rsquo;s suddenly
      recollecting that the water was nowhere more than five feet deep,
      prodigies of valour were performed to get him out. After a vast quantity
      of splashing, and cracking, and struggling, Mr. Pickwick was at length
      fairly extricated from his unpleasant position, and once more stood on dry
      land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll catch his death of cold,&rsquo; said Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear old thing!&rsquo; said Arabella. &lsquo;Let me wrap this shawl round you, Mr.
      Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the best thing you can do,&rsquo; said Wardle; &lsquo;and when you&rsquo;ve got
      it on, run home as fast as your legs can carry you, and jump into bed
      directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A dozen shawls were offered on the instant. Three or four of the thickest
      having been selected, Mr. Pickwick was wrapped up, and started off, under
      the guidance of Mr. Weller; presenting the singular phenomenon of an
      elderly gentleman, dripping wet, and without a hat, with his arms bound
      down to his sides, skimming over the ground, without any clearly-defined
      purpose, at the rate of six good English miles an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Pickwick cared not for appearances in such an extreme case, and
      urged on by Sam Weller, he kept at the very top of his speed until he
      reached the door of Manor Farm, where Mr. Tupman had arrived some five
      minutes before, and had frightened the old lady into palpitations of the
      heart by impressing her with the unalterable conviction that the kitchen
      chimney was on fire&mdash;a calamity which always presented itself in
      glowing colours to the old lady&rsquo;s mind, when anybody about her evinced the
      smallest agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick paused not an instant until he was snug in bed. Sam Weller
      lighted a blazing fire in the room, and took up his dinner; a bowl of
      punch was carried up afterwards, and a grand carouse held in honour of his
      safety. Old Wardle would not hear of his rising, so they made the bed the
      chair, and Mr. Pickwick presided. A second and a third bowl were ordered
      in; and when Mr. Pickwick awoke next morning, there was not a symptom of
      rheumatism about him; which proves, as Mr. Bob Sawyer very justly
      observed, that there is nothing like hot punch in such cases; and that if
      ever hot punch did fail to act as a preventive, it was merely because the
      patient fell into the vulgar error of not taking enough of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jovial party broke up next morning. Breakings-up are capital things in
      our school-days, but in after life they are painful enough. Death,
      self-interest, and fortune&rsquo;s changes, are every day breaking up many a
      happy group, and scattering them far and wide; and the boys and girls
      never come back again. We do not mean to say that it was exactly the case
      in this particular instance; all we wish to inform the reader is, that the
      different members of the party dispersed to their several homes; that Mr.
      Pickwick and his friends once more took their seats on the top of the
      Muggleton coach; and that Arabella Allen repaired to her place of
      destination, wherever it might have been&mdash;we dare say Mr. Winkle
      knew, but we confess we don&rsquo;t&mdash;under the care and guardianship of her
      brother Benjamin, and his most intimate and particular friend, Mr. Bob
      Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they separated, however, that gentleman and Mr. Benjamin Allen drew
      Mr. Pickwick aside with an air of some mystery; and Mr. Bob Sawyer,
      thrusting his forefinger between two of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s ribs, and thereby
      displaying his native drollery, and his knowledge of the anatomy of the
      human frame, at one and the same time, inquired&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, old boy, where do you hang out?&rsquo; Mr. Pickwick replied that he was
      at present suspended at the George and Vulture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you&rsquo;d come and see me,&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing would give me greater pleasure,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s my lodgings,&rsquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer, producing a card. &lsquo;Lant
      Street, Borough; it&rsquo;s near Guy&rsquo;s, and handy for me, you know. Little
      distance after you&rsquo;ve passed St. George&rsquo;s Church&mdash;turns out of the
      High Street on the right hand side the way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall find it,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come on Thursday fortnight, and bring the other chaps with you,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Bob Sawyer; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a few medical fellows that night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick expressed the pleasure it would afford him to meet the
      medical fellows; and after Mr. Bob Sawyer had informed him that he meant
      to be very cosy, and that his friend Ben was to be one of the party, they
      shook hands and separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      We feel that in this place we lay ourself open to the inquiry whether Mr.
      Winkle was whispering, during this brief conversation, to Arabella Allen;
      and if so, what he said; and furthermore, whether Mr. Snodgrass was
      conversing apart with Emily Wardle; and if so, what <i>he</i> said. To
      this, we reply, that whatever they might have said to the ladies, they
      said nothing at all to Mr. Pickwick or Mr. Tupman for eight-and-twenty
      miles, and that they sighed very often, refused ale and brandy, and looked
      gloomy. If our observant lady readers can deduce any satisfactory
      inferences from these facts, we beg them by all means to do so.

      CHAPTER XXXI. WHICH IS ALL ABOUT THE LAW, AND SUNDRY GREAT AUTHORITIES
      LEARNED THEREIN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>cattered about, in
      various holes and corners of the Temple, are certain dark and dirty
      chambers, in and out of which, all the morning in vacation, and half the
      evening too in term time, there may be seen constantly hurrying with
      bundles of papers under their arms, and protruding from their pockets, an
      almost uninterrupted succession of lawyers&rsquo; clerks. There are several
      grades of lawyers&rsquo; clerks. There is the articled clerk, who has paid a
      premium, and is an attorney in perspective, who runs a tailor&rsquo;s bill,
      receives invitations to parties, knows a family in Gower Street, and
      another in Tavistock Square; who goes out of town every long vacation to
      see his father, who keeps live horses innumerable; and who is, in short,
      the very aristocrat of clerks. There is the salaried clerk&mdash;out of
      door, or in door, as the case may be&mdash;who devotes the major part of
      his thirty shillings a week to his Personal pleasure and adornments,
      repairs half-price to the Adelphi Theatre at least three times a week,
      dissipates majestically at the cider cellars afterwards, and is a dirty
      caricature of the fashion which expired six months ago. There is the
      middle-aged copying clerk, with a large family, who is always shabby, and
      often drunk. And there are the office lads in their first surtouts, who
      feel a befitting contempt for boys at day-schools, club as they go home at
      night, for saveloys and porter, and think there&rsquo;s nothing like &lsquo;life.&rsquo; 
      There are varieties of the genus, too numerous to recapitulate, but
      however numerous they may be, they are all to be seen, at certain
      regulated business hours, hurrying to and from the places we have just
      mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      These sequestered nooks are the public offices of the legal profession,
      where writs are issued, judgments signed, declarations filed, and numerous
      other ingenious machines put in motion for the torture and torment of His
      Majesty&rsquo;s liege subjects, and the comfort and emolument of the
      practitioners of the law. They are, for the most part, low-roofed, mouldy
      rooms, where innumerable rolls of parchment, which have been perspiring in
      secret for the last century, send forth an agreeable odour, which is
      mingled by day with the scent of the dry-rot, and by night with the
      various exhalations which arise from damp cloaks, festering umbrellas, and
      the coarsest tallow candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half-past seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, some ten days or a fortnight
      after Mr. Pickwick and his friends returned to London, there hurried into
      one of these offices, an individual in a brown coat and brass buttons,
      whose long hair was scrupulously twisted round the rim of his napless hat,
      and whose soiled drab trousers were so tightly strapped over his Blucher
      boots, that his knees threatened every moment to start from their
      concealment. He produced from his coat pockets a long and narrow strip of
      parchment, on which the presiding functionary impressed an illegible black
      stamp. He then drew forth four scraps of paper, of similar dimensions,
      each containing a printed copy of the strip of parchment with blanks for a
      name; and having filled up the blanks, put all the five documents in his
      pocket, and hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the brown coat, with the cabalistic documents in his pocket,
      was no other than our old acquaintance Mr. Jackson, of the house of Dodson
      &amp; Fogg, Freeman&rsquo;s Court, Cornhill. Instead of returning to the office
      whence he came, however, he bent his steps direct to Sun Court, and
      walking straight into the George and Vulture, demanded to know whether one
      Mr. Pickwick was within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Call Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s servant, Tom,&rsquo; said the barmaid of the George and
      Vulture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself,&rsquo; said Mr. Jackson. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve come on business. If
      you&rsquo;ll show me Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s room I&rsquo;ll step up myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What name, Sir?&rsquo; said the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jackson,&rsquo; replied the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter stepped upstairs to announce Mr. Jackson; but Mr. Jackson saved
      him the trouble by following close at his heels, and walking into the
      apartment before he could articulate a syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick had, that day, invited his three friends to dinner; they were
      all seated round the fire, drinking their wine, when Mr. Jackson presented
      himself, as above described.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How de do, sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Jackson, nodding to Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      That gentleman bowed, and looked somewhat surprised, for the physiognomy
      of Mr. Jackson dwelt not in his recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have called from Dodson and Fogg&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said Mr. Jackson, in an
      explanatory tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick roused at the name. &lsquo;I refer you to my attorney, Sir; Mr.
      Perker, of Gray&rsquo;s Inn,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Waiter, show this gentleman out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beg your pardon, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Jackson, deliberately depositing his
      hat on the floor, and drawing from his pocket the strip of parchment. &lsquo;But
      personal service, by clerk or agent, in these cases, you know, Mr.
      Pickwick&mdash;nothing like caution, sir, in all legal forms&mdash;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Jackson cast his eye on the parchment; and, resting his hands on
      the table, and looking round with a winning and persuasive smile, said,
      &lsquo;Now, come; don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s have no words about such a little matter as this.
      Which of you gentlemen&rsquo;s name&rsquo;s Snodgrass?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this inquiry, Mr. Snodgrass gave such a very undisguised and palpable
      start, that no further reply was needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I thought so,&rsquo; said Mr. Jackson, more affably than before. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a
      little something to trouble you with, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Me!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only a subpoena in Bardell and Pickwick on behalf of the plaintiff,&rsquo; 
      replied Jackson, singling out one of the slips of paper, and producing a
      shilling from his waistcoat pocket. &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll come on, in the settens after
      Term: fourteenth of Febooary, we expect; we&rsquo;ve marked it a special jury
      cause, and it&rsquo;s only ten down the paper. That&rsquo;s yours, Mr. Snodgrass.&rsquo; As
      Jackson said this, he presented the parchment before the eyes of Mr.
      Snodgrass, and slipped the paper and the shilling into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman had witnessed this process in silent astonishment, when
      Jackson, turning sharply upon him, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I ain&rsquo;t mistaken when I say your name&rsquo;s Tupman, am I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman looked at Mr. Pickwick; but, perceiving no encouragement in
      that gentleman&rsquo;s widely-opened eyes to deny his name, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my name is Tupman, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that other gentleman&rsquo;s Mr. Winkle, I think?&rsquo; said Jackson. Mr. Winkle
      faltered out a reply in the affirmative; and both gentlemen were forthwith
      invested with a slip of paper, and a shilling each, by the dexterous Mr.
      Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Jackson, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll think me rather troublesome, but I
      want somebody else, if it ain&rsquo;t inconvenient. I have Samuel Weller&rsquo;s name
      here, Mr. Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Send my servant here, waiter,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. The waiter retired,
      considerably astonished, and Mr. Pickwick motioned Jackson to a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a painful pause, which was at length broken by the innocent
      defendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, his indignation rising while he spoke&mdash;&lsquo;I
      suppose, Sir, that it is the intention of your employers to seek to
      criminate me upon the testimony of my own friends?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jackson struck his forefinger several times against the left side of
      his nose, to intimate that he was not there to disclose the secrets of the
      prison house, and playfully rejoined&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not knowin&rsquo;, can&rsquo;t say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For what other reason, Sir,&rsquo; pursued Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;are these subpoenas
      served upon them, if not for this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good plant, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; replied Jackson, slowly shaking his head.
      &lsquo;But it won&rsquo;t do. No harm in trying, but there&rsquo;s little to be got out of
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Jackson smiled once more upon the company, and, applying his left
      thumb to the tip of his nose, worked a visionary coffee-mill with his
      right hand, thereby performing a very graceful piece of pantomime (then
      much in vogue, but now, unhappily, almost obsolete) which was familiarly
      denominated &lsquo;taking a grinder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Jackson, in conclusion; &lsquo;Perker&rsquo;s people must
      guess what we&rsquo;ve served these subpoenas for. If they can&rsquo;t, they must wait
      till the action comes on, and then they&rsquo;ll find out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick bestowed a look of excessive disgust on his unwelcome
      visitor, and would probably have hurled some tremendous anathema at the
      heads of Messrs. Dodson &amp; Fogg, had not Sam&rsquo;s entrance at the instant
      interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Samuel Weller?&rsquo; said Mr. Jackson, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vun o&rsquo; the truest things as you&rsquo;ve said for many a long year,&rsquo; replied
      Sam, in a most composed manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a subpoena for you, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that in English?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the original,&rsquo; said Jackson, declining the required explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; replied Jackson, shaking the parchment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the &lsquo;rig&rsquo;nal, is it?&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m wery glad I&rsquo;ve seen
      the &lsquo;rig&rsquo;nal, &lsquo;cos it&rsquo;s a gratifyin&rsquo; sort o&rsquo; thing, and eases vun&rsquo;s mind
      so much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And here&rsquo;s the shilling,&rsquo; said Jackson. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s from Dodson and Fogg&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it&rsquo;s uncommon handsome o&rsquo; Dodson and Fogg, as knows so little of me,
      to come down vith a present,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;I feel it as a wery high
      compliment, sir; it&rsquo;s a wery honorable thing to them, as they knows how to
      reward merit werever they meets it. Besides which, it&rsquo;s affectin&rsquo; to one&rsquo;s
      feelin&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Weller said this, he inflicted a little friction on his right
      eyelid, with the sleeve of his coat, after the most approved manner of
      actors when they are in domestic pathetics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jackson seemed rather puzzled by Sam&rsquo;s proceedings; but, as he had
      served the subpoenas, and had nothing more to say, he made a feint of
      putting on the one glove which he usually carried in his hand, for the
      sake of appearances; and returned to the office to report progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick slept little that night; his memory had received a very
      disagreeable refresher on the subject of Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s action. He
      breakfasted betimes next morning, and, desiring Sam to accompany him, set
      forth towards Gray&rsquo;s Inn Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking round, when they got to the end of
      Cheapside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir?&rsquo; said Sam, stepping up to his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which way?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Up Newgate Street.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick did not turn round immediately, but looked vacantly in Sam&rsquo;s
      face for a few seconds, and heaved a deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, sir?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This action, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;is expected to come on, on the
      fourteenth of next month.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Remarkable coincidence that &lsquo;ere, sir,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why remarkable, Sam?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Walentine&rsquo;s day, sir,&rsquo; responded Sam; &lsquo;reg&rsquo;lar good day for a breach o&rsquo; 
      promise trial.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller&rsquo;s smile awakened no gleam of mirth in his master&rsquo;s countenance.
      Mr. Pickwick turned abruptly round, and led the way in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had walked some distance, Mr. Pickwick trotting on before, plunged in
      profound meditation, and Sam following behind, with a countenance
      expressive of the most enviable and easy defiance of everything and
      everybody, when the latter, who was always especially anxious to impart to
      his master any exclusive information he possessed, quickened his pace
      until he was close at Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s heels; and, pointing up at a house
      they were passing, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery nice pork-shop that &lsquo;ere, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it seems so,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Celebrated sassage factory,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it!&rsquo; reiterated Sam, with some indignation; &lsquo;I should rayther think it
      was. Why, sir, bless your innocent eyebrows, that&rsquo;s where the mysterious
      disappearance of a &lsquo;spectable tradesman took place four years ago.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say he was burked, Sam?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking
      hastily round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t indeed, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, &lsquo;I wish I did; far worse
      than that. He was the master o&rsquo; that &lsquo;ere shop, sir, and the inwentor o&rsquo; 
      the patent-never-leavin&rsquo;-off sassage steam-ingin, as &lsquo;ud swaller up a
      pavin&rsquo; stone if you put it too near, and grind it into sassages as easy as
      if it was a tender young babby. Wery proud o&rsquo; that machine he was, as it
      was nat&rsquo;ral he should be, and he&rsquo;d stand down in the celler a-lookin&rsquo; at
      it wen it was in full play, till he got quite melancholy with joy. A wery
      happy man he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been, Sir, in the procession o&rsquo; that &lsquo;ere ingin and two
      more lovely hinfants besides, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for his wife, who was a
      most owdacious wixin. She was always a-follerin&rsquo; him about, and dinnin&rsquo; in
      his ears, till at last he couldn&rsquo;t stand it no longer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what
      it is, my dear,&rdquo; he says one day; &ldquo;if you persewere in this here sort of
      amusement,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m blessed if I don&rsquo;t go away to &lsquo;Merriker; and
      that&rsquo;s all about it.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a idle willin,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;and I wish the
      &lsquo;Merrikins joy of their bargain.&rdquo; Arter which she keeps on abusin&rsquo; of him
      for half an hour, and then runs into the little parlour behind the shop,
      sets to a-screamin&rsquo;, says he&rsquo;ll be the death on her, and falls in a fit,
      which lasts for three good hours&mdash;one o&rsquo; them fits wich is all
      screamin&rsquo; and kickin&rsquo;. Well, next mornin&rsquo;, the husband was missin&rsquo;. He
      hadn&rsquo;t taken nothin&rsquo; from the till&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t even put on his greatcoat&mdash;so
      it was quite clear he warn&rsquo;t gone to &lsquo;Merriker. Didn&rsquo;t come back next day;
      didn&rsquo;t come back next week; missis had bills printed, sayin&rsquo; that, if he&rsquo;d
      come back, he should be forgiven everythin&rsquo; (which was very liberal,
      seein&rsquo; that he hadn&rsquo;t done nothin&rsquo; at all); the canals was dragged, and
      for two months arterwards, wenever a body turned up, it was carried, as a
      reg&rsquo;lar thing, straight off to the sassage shop. Hows&rsquo;ever, none on &lsquo;em
      answered; so they gave out that he&rsquo;d run away, and she kep&rsquo; on the
      bis&rsquo;ness. One Saturday night, a little, thin, old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n comes into the
      shop in a great passion and says, &ldquo;Are you the missis o&rsquo; this here shop?&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;ve just looked in
      to say that me and my family ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to be choked for nothin&rsquo;; and
      more than that, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll allow me to observe that as you
      don&rsquo;t use the primest parts of the meat in the manafacter o&rsquo; sassages, I&rsquo;d
      think you&rsquo;d find beef come nearly as cheap as buttons.&rdquo; &ldquo;As buttons, Sir!&rdquo;
       says she. &ldquo;Buttons, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; says the little, old gentleman, unfolding a
      bit of paper, and showin&rsquo; twenty or thirty halves o&rsquo; buttons. &ldquo;Nice
      seasonin&rsquo; for sassages, is trousers&rsquo; buttons, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re my
      husband&rsquo;s buttons!&rdquo; says the widder beginnin&rsquo; to faint, &ldquo;What!&rdquo; screams
      the little old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, turnin&rsquo; wery pale. &ldquo;I see it all,&rdquo; says the
      widder; &ldquo;in a fit of temporary insanity he rashly converted hisself into
      sassages!&rdquo; And so he had, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, looking steadily into Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s horror-stricken countenance, &lsquo;or else he&rsquo;d been draw&rsquo;d into the
      ingin; but however that might ha&rsquo; been, the little, old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, who had
      been remarkably partial to sassages all his life, rushed out o&rsquo; the shop
      in a wild state, and was never heerd on arterwards!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The relation of this affecting incident of private life brought master and
      man to Mr. Perker&rsquo;s chambers. Lowten, holding the door half open, was in
      conversation with a rustily-clad, miserable-looking man, in boots without
      toes and gloves without fingers. There were traces of privation and
      suffering&mdash;almost of despair&mdash;in his lank and care-worn
      countenance; he felt his poverty, for he shrank to the dark side of the
      staircase as Mr. Pickwick approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very unfortunate,&rsquo; said the stranger, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very,&rsquo; said Lowten, scribbling his name on the doorpost with his pen, and
      rubbing it out again with the feather. &lsquo;Will you leave a message for him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When do you think he&rsquo;ll be back?&rsquo; inquired the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite uncertain,&rsquo; replied Lowten, winking at Mr. Pickwick, as the
      stranger cast his eyes towards the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t think it would be of any use my waiting for him?&rsquo; said the
      stranger, looking wistfully into the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no, I&rsquo;m sure it wouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied the clerk, moving a little more
      into the centre of the doorway. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s certain not to be back this week,
      and it&rsquo;s a chance whether he will be next; for when Perker once gets out
      of town, he&rsquo;s never in a hurry to come back again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Out of town!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;dear me, how unfortunate!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go away, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Lowten, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a letter for you.&rsquo; 
      The stranger, seeming to hesitate, once more looked towards the ground,
      and the clerk winked slyly at Mr. Pickwick, as if to intimate that some
      exquisite piece of humour was going forward, though what it was Mr.
      Pickwick could not for the life of him divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Step in, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Lowten. &lsquo;Well, will you leave a message, Mr.
      Watty, or will you call again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ask him to be so kind as to leave out word what has been done in my
      business,&rsquo; said the man; &lsquo;for God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t neglect it, Mr. Lowten.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; I won&rsquo;t forget it,&rsquo; replied the clerk. &lsquo;Walk in, Mr. Pickwick.
      Good-morning, Mr. Watty; it&rsquo;s a fine day for walking, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; Seeing
      that the stranger still lingered, he beckoned Sam Weller to follow his
      master in, and shut the door in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There never was such a pestering bankrupt as that since the world began,
      I do believe!&rsquo; said Lowten, throwing down his pen with the air of an
      injured man. &lsquo;His affairs haven&rsquo;t been in Chancery quite four years yet,
      and I&rsquo;m d&mdash;&mdash;d if he don&rsquo;t come worrying here twice a week. Step
      this way, Mr. Pickwick. Perker <i>is</i> in, and he&rsquo;ll see you, I know.
      Devilish cold,&rsquo; he added pettishly, &lsquo;standing at that door, wasting one&rsquo;s
      time with such seedy vagabonds!&rsquo; Having very vehemently stirred a
      particularly large fire with a particularly small poker, the clerk led the
      way to his principal&rsquo;s private room, and announced Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, my dear Sir,&rsquo; said little Mr. Perker, bustling up from his chair.
      &lsquo;Well, my dear sir, and what&rsquo;s the news about your matter, eh? Anything
      more about our friends in Freeman&rsquo;s Court? They&rsquo;ve not been sleeping, I
      know that. Ah, they&rsquo;re very smart fellows; very smart, indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the little man concluded, he took an emphatic pinch of snuff, as a
      tribute to the smartness of Messrs. Dodson and Fogg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are great scoundrels,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye,&rsquo; said the little man; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s a matter of opinion, you know,
      and we won&rsquo;t dispute about terms; because of course you can&rsquo;t be expected
      to view these subjects with a professional eye. Well, we&rsquo;ve done
      everything that&rsquo;s necessary. I have retained Serjeant Snubbin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he a good man?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good man!&rsquo; replied Perker; &lsquo;bless your heart and soul, my dear Sir,
      Serjeant Snubbin is at the very top of his profession. Gets treble the
      business of any man in court&mdash;engaged in every case. You needn&rsquo;t
      mention it abroad; but we say&mdash;we of the profession&mdash;that
      Serjeant Snubbin leads the court by the nose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man took another pinch of snuff as he made this communication,
      and nodded mysteriously to Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They have subpoenaed my three friends,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! of course they would,&rsquo; replied Perker. &lsquo;Important witnesses; saw you
      in a delicate situation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But she fainted of her own accord,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;She threw herself
      into my arms.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very likely, my dear Sir,&rsquo; replied Perker; &lsquo;very likely and very natural.
      Nothing more so, my dear Sir, nothing. But who&rsquo;s to prove it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They have subpoenaed my servant, too,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, quitting the
      other point; for there Mr. Perker&rsquo;s question had somewhat staggered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam?&rsquo; said Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick replied in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, my dear Sir; of course. I knew they would. I could have told
      you that, a month ago. You know, my dear Sir, if you <i>will </i>take the
      management of your affairs into your own hands after entrusting them to
      your solicitor, you must also take the consequences.&rsquo; Here Mr. Perker drew
      himself up with conscious dignity, and brushed some stray grains of snuff
      from his shirt frill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what do they want him to prove?&rsquo; asked Mr. Pickwick, after two or
      three minutes&rsquo; silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That you sent him up to the plaintiff &lsquo;s to make some offer of a
      compromise, I suppose,&rsquo; replied Perker. &lsquo;It don&rsquo;t matter much, though; I
      don&rsquo;t think many counsel could get a great deal out of <i>him</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think they could,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, smiling, despite his
      vexation, at the idea of Sam&rsquo;s appearance as a witness. &lsquo;What course do we
      pursue?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have only one to adopt, my dear Sir,&rsquo; replied Perker; &lsquo;cross-examine
      the witnesses; trust to Snubbin&rsquo;s eloquence; throw dust in the eyes of the
      judge; throw ourselves on the jury.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And suppose the verdict is against me?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Perker smiled, took a very long pinch of snuff, stirred the fire,
      shrugged his shoulders, and remained expressively silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean that in that case I must pay the damages?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
      who had watched this telegraphic answer with considerable sternness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perker gave the fire another very unnecessary poke, and said, &lsquo;I am afraid
      so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I beg to announce to you my unalterable determination to pay no
      damages whatever,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, most emphatically. &lsquo;None, Perker.
      Not a pound, not a penny of my money, shall find its way into the pockets
      of Dodson and Fogg. That is my deliberate and irrevocable determination.&rsquo; 
      Mr. Pickwick gave a heavy blow on the table before him, in confirmation of
      the irrevocability of his intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, my dear Sir, very well,&rsquo; said Perker. &lsquo;You know best, of
      course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick hastily. &lsquo;Where does Serjeant Snubbin
      live?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Old Square,&rsquo; replied Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to see him,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See Serjeant Snubbin, my dear Sir!&rsquo; rejoined Perker, in utter amazement.
      &lsquo;Pooh, pooh, my dear Sir, impossible. See Serjeant Snubbin! Bless you, my
      dear Sir, such a thing was never heard of, without a consultation fee
      being previously paid, and a consultation fixed. It couldn&rsquo;t be done, my
      dear Sir; it couldn&rsquo;t be done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick, however, had made up his mind not only that it could be
      done, but that it should be done; and the consequence was, that within ten
      minutes after he had received the assurance that the thing was impossible,
      he was conducted by his solicitor into the outer office of the great
      Serjeant Snubbin himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an uncarpeted room of tolerable dimensions, with a large
      writing-table drawn up near the fire, the baize top of which had long
      since lost all claim to its original hue of green, and had gradually grown
      gray with dust and age, except where all traces of its natural colour were
      obliterated by ink-stains. Upon the table were numerous little bundles of
      papers tied with red tape; and behind it, sat an elderly clerk, whose
      sleek appearance and heavy gold watch-chain presented imposing indications
      of the extensive and lucrative practice of Mr. Serjeant Snubbin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is the Serjeant in his room, Mr. Mallard?&rsquo; inquired Perker, offering his
      box with all imaginable courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he is,&rsquo; was the reply, &lsquo;but he&rsquo;s very busy. Look here; not an
      opinion given yet, on any one of these cases; and an expedition fee paid
      with all of &lsquo;em.&rsquo; The clerk smiled as he said this, and inhaled the pinch
      of snuff with a zest which seemed to be compounded of a fondness for snuff
      and a relish for fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something like practice that,&rsquo; said Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the barrister&rsquo;s clerk, producing his own box, and offering it
      with the greatest cordiality; &lsquo;and the best of it is, that as nobody alive
      except myself can read the serjeant&rsquo;s writing, they are obliged to wait
      for the opinions, when he has given them, till I have copied &lsquo;em,
      ha-ha-ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which makes good for we know who, besides the serjeant, and draws a
      little more out of the clients, eh?&rsquo; said Perker; &lsquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rsquo; At this
      the serjeant&rsquo;s clerk laughed again&mdash;not a noisy boisterous laugh, but
      a silent, internal chuckle, which Mr. Pickwick disliked to hear. When a
      man bleeds inwardly, it is a dangerous thing for himself; but when he
      laughs inwardly, it bodes no good to other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t made me out that little list of the fees that I&rsquo;m in your
      debt, have you?&rsquo; said Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I have not,&rsquo; replied the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you would,&rsquo; said Perker. &lsquo;Let me have them, and I&rsquo;ll send you a
      cheque. But I suppose you&rsquo;re too busy pocketing the ready money, to think
      of the debtors, eh? ha, ha, ha!&rsquo; This sally seemed to tickle the clerk
      amazingly, and he once more enjoyed a little quiet laugh to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Mr. Mallard, my dear friend,&rsquo; said Perker, suddenly recovering his
      gravity, and drawing the great man&rsquo;s great man into a Corner, by the
      lappel of his coat; &lsquo;you must persuade the Serjeant to see me, and my
      client here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; said the clerk, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s not bad either. See the Serjeant!
      come, that&rsquo;s too absurd.&rsquo; Notwithstanding the absurdity of the proposal,
      however, the clerk allowed himself to be gently drawn beyond the hearing
      of Mr. Pickwick; and after a short conversation conducted in whispers,
      walked softly down a little dark passage, and disappeared into the legal
      luminary&rsquo;s sanctum, whence he shortly returned on tiptoe, and informed Mr.
      Perker and Mr. Pickwick that the Serjeant had been prevailed upon, in
      violation of all established rules and customs, to admit them at once.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      Mr. Serjeant Snubbins was a lantern-faced, sallow-complexioned man, of
      about five-and-forty, or&mdash;as the novels say&mdash;he might be fifty.
      He had that dull-looking, boiled eye which is often to be seen in the
      heads of people who have applied themselves during many years to a weary
      and laborious course of study; and which would have been sufficient,
      without the additional eyeglass which dangled from a broad black riband
      round his neck, to warn a stranger that he was very near-sighted. His hair
      was thin and weak, which was partly attributable to his having never
      devoted much time to its arrangement, and partly to his having worn for
      five-and-twenty years the forensic wig which hung on a block beside him.
      The marks of hairpowder on his coat-collar, and the ill-washed and worse
      tied white neckerchief round his throat, showed that he had not found
      leisure since he left the court to make any alteration in his dress; while
      the slovenly style of the remainder of his costume warranted the inference
      that his personal appearance would not have been very much improved if he
      had. Books of practice, heaps of papers, and opened letters, were
      scattered over the table, without any attempt at order or arrangement; the
      furniture of the room was old and rickety; the doors of the book-case were
      rotting in their hinges; the dust flew out from the carpet in little
      clouds at every step; the blinds were yellow with age and dirt; the state
      of everything in the room showed, with a clearness not to be mistaken,
      that Mr. Serjeant Snubbin was far too much occupied with his professional
      pursuits to take any great heed or regard of his personal comforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Serjeant was writing when his clients entered; he bowed abstractedly
      when Mr. Pickwick was introduced by his solicitor; and then, motioning
      them to a seat, put his pen carefully in the inkstand, nursed his left
      leg, and waited to be spoken to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick is the defendant in Bardell and Pickwick, Serjeant Snubbin,&rsquo; 
      said Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am retained in that, am I?&rsquo; said the Serjeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are, Sir,&rsquo; replied Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Serjeant nodded his head, and waited for something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick was anxious to call upon you, Serjeant Snubbin,&rsquo; said
      Perker, &lsquo;to state to you, before you entered upon the case, that he denies
      there being any ground or pretence whatever for the action against him;
      and that unless he came into court with clean hands, and without the most
      conscientious conviction that he was right in resisting the plaintiff&rsquo;s
      demand, he would not be there at all. I believe I state your views
      correctly; do I not, my dear Sir?&rsquo; said the little man, turning to Mr.
      Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite so,&rsquo; replied that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Serjeant Snubbin unfolded his glasses, raised them to his eyes; and,
      after looking at Mr. Pickwick for a few seconds with great curiosity,
      turned to Mr. Perker, and said, smiling slightly as he spoke&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has Mr. Pickwick a strong case?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The attorney shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you propose calling witnesses?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile on the Serjeant&rsquo;s countenance became more defined; he rocked his
      leg with increased violence; and, throwing himself back in his easy-chair,
      coughed dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      These tokens of the Serjeant&rsquo;s presentiments on the subject, slight as
      they were, were not lost on Mr. Pickwick. He settled the spectacles,
      through which he had attentively regarded such demonstrations of the
      barrister&rsquo;s feelings as he had permitted himself to exhibit, more firmly
      on his nose; and said with great energy, and in utter disregard of all Mr.
      Perker&rsquo;s admonitory winkings and frownings&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My wishing to wait upon you, for such a purpose as this, Sir, appears, I
      have no doubt, to a gentleman who sees so much of these matters as you
      must necessarily do, a very extraordinary circumstance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Serjeant tried to look gravely at the fire, but the smile came back
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen of your profession, Sir,&rsquo; continued Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;see the
      worst side of human nature. All its disputes, all its ill-will and bad
      blood, rise up before you. You know from your experience of juries (I mean
      no disparagement to you, or them) how much depends upon effect; and you
      are apt to attribute to others, a desire to use, for purposes of deception
      and self-interest, the very instruments which you, in pure honesty and
      honour of purpose, and with a laudable desire to do your utmost for your
      client, know the temper and worth of so well, from constantly employing
      them yourselves. I really believe that to this circumstance may be
      attributed the vulgar but very general notion of your being, as a body,
      suspicious, distrustful, and over-cautious. Conscious as I am, sir, of the
      disadvantage of making such a declaration to you, under such
      circumstances, I have come here, because I wish you distinctly to
      understand, as my friend Mr. Perker has said, that I am innocent of the
      falsehood laid to my charge; and although I am very well aware of the
      inestimable value of your assistance, Sir, I must beg to add, that unless
      you sincerely believe this, I would rather be deprived of the aid of your
      talents than have the advantage of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before the close of this address, which we are bound to say was of a
      very prosy character for Mr. Pickwick, the Serjeant had relapsed into a
      state of abstraction. After some minutes, however, during which he had
      reassumed his pen, he appeared to be again aware of the presence of his
      clients; raising his head from the paper, he said, rather snappishly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is with me in this case?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Phunky, Serjeant Snubbin,&rsquo; replied the attorney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Phunky&mdash;Phunky,&rsquo; said the Serjeant, &lsquo;I never heard the name before.
      He must be a very young man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he is a very young man,&rsquo; replied the attorney. &lsquo;He was only called
      the other day. Let me see&mdash;he has not been at the Bar eight years
      yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I thought not,&rsquo; said the Serjeant, in that sort of pitying tone in
      which ordinary folks would speak of a very helpless little child. &lsquo;Mr.
      Mallard, send round to Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Phunky&rsquo;s&mdash;Holborn Court, Gray&rsquo;s Inn,&rsquo; interposed Perker. (Holborn
      Court, by the bye, is South Square now.)&mdash;&lsquo;Mr. Phunky, and say I
      should be glad if he&rsquo;d step here, a moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mallard departed to execute his commission; and Serjeant Snubbin
      relapsed into abstraction until Mr. Phunky himself was introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although an infant barrister, he was a full-grown man. He had a very
      nervous manner, and a painful hesitation in his speech; it did not appear
      to be a natural defect, but seemed rather the result of timidity, arising
      from the consciousness of being &lsquo;kept down&rsquo; by want of means, or interest,
      or connection, or impudence, as the case might be. He was overawed by the
      Serjeant, and profoundly courteous to the attorney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not had the pleasure of seeing you before, Mr. Phunky,&rsquo; said
      Serjeant Snubbin, with haughty condescension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Phunky bowed. He <i>had </i>had the pleasure of seeing the Serjeant,
      and of envying him too, with all a poor man&rsquo;s envy, for eight years and a
      quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are with me in this case, I understand?&rsquo; said the Serjeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Phunky had been a rich man, he would have instantly sent for his
      clerk to remind him; if he had been a wise one, he would have applied his
      forefinger to his forehead, and endeavoured to recollect, whether, in the
      multiplicity of his engagements, he had undertaken this one or not; but as
      he was neither rich nor wise (in this sense, at all events) he turned red,
      and bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you read the papers, Mr. Phunky?&rsquo; inquired the Serjeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here again, Mr. Phunky should have professed to have forgotten all about
      the merits of the case; but as he had read such papers as had been laid
      before him in the course of the action, and had thought of nothing else,
      waking or sleeping, throughout the two months during which he had been
      retained as Mr. Serjeant Snubbin&rsquo;s junior, he turned a deeper red and
      bowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said the Serjeant, waving his pen in the direction
      in which that gentleman was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Phunky bowed to Mr. Pickwick, with a reverence which a first client
      must ever awaken; and again inclined his head towards his leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps you will take Mr. Pickwick away,&rsquo; said the Serjeant, &lsquo;and&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;hear
      anything Mr. Pickwick may wish to communicate. We shall have a
      consultation, of course.&rsquo; With that hint that he had been interrupted
      quite long enough, Mr. Serjeant Snubbin, who had been gradually growing
      more and more abstracted, applied his glass to his eyes for an instant,
      bowed slightly round, and was once more deeply immersed in the case before
      him, which arose out of an interminable lawsuit, originating in the act of
      an individual, deceased a century or so ago, who had stopped up a pathway
      leading from some place which nobody ever came from, to some other place
      which nobody ever went to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Phunky would not hear of passing through any door until Mr. Pickwick
      and his solicitor had passed through before him, so it was some time
      before they got into the Square; and when they did reach it, they walked
      up and down, and held a long conference, the result of which was, that it
      was a very difficult matter to say how the verdict would go; that nobody
      could presume to calculate on the issue of an action; that it was very
      lucky they had prevented the other party from getting Serjeant Snubbin;
      and other topics of doubt and consolation, common in such a position of
      affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller was then roused by his master from a sweet sleep of an hour&rsquo;s
      duration; and, bidding adieu to Lowten, they returned to the city.

      CHAPTER XXXII. DESCRIBES, FAR MORE FULLY THAN THE COURT NEWSMAN EVER DID,
      A BACHELOR&rsquo;S PARTY, GIVEN BY MR. BOB SAWYER AT HIS LODGINGS IN THE BOROUGH
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here is a repose
      about Lant Street, in the Borough, which sheds a gentle melancholy upon
      the soul. There are always a good many houses to let in the street: it is
      a by-street too, and its dulness is soothing. A house in Lant Street would
      not come within the denomination of a first-rate residence, in the strict
      acceptation of the term; but it is a most desirable spot nevertheless. If
      a man wished to abstract himself from the world&mdash;to remove himself
      from within the reach of temptation&mdash;to place himself beyond the
      possibility of any inducement to look out of the window&mdash;we should
      recommend him by all means go to Lant Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this happy retreat are colonised a few clear-starchers, a sprinkling of
      journeymen bookbinders, one or two prison agents for the Insolvent Court,
      several small housekeepers who are employed in the Docks, a handful of
      mantua-makers, and a seasoning of jobbing tailors. The majority of the
      inhabitants either direct their energies to the letting of furnished
      apartments, or devote themselves to the healthful and invigorating pursuit
      of mangling. The chief features in the still life of the street are green
      shutters, lodging-bills, brass door-plates, and bell-handles; the
      principal specimens of animated nature, the pot-boy, the muffin youth, and
      the baked-potato man. The population is migratory, usually disappearing on
      the verge of quarter-day, and generally by night. His Majesty&rsquo;s revenues
      are seldom collected in this happy valley; the rents are dubious; and the
      water communication is very frequently cut off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bob Sawyer embellished one side of the fire, in his first-floor front,
      early on the evening for which he had invited Mr. Pickwick, and Mr. Ben
      Allen the other. The preparations for the reception of visitors appeared
      to be completed. The umbrellas in the passage had been heaped into the
      little corner outside the back-parlour door; the bonnet and shawl of the
      landlady&rsquo;s servant had been removed from the bannisters; there were not
      more than two pairs of pattens on the street-door mat; and a kitchen
      candle, with a very long snuff, burned cheerfully on the ledge of the
      staircase window. Mr. Bob Sawyer had himself purchased the spirits at a
      wine vaults in High Street, and had returned home preceding the bearer
      thereof, to preclude the possibility of their delivery at the wrong house.
      The punch was ready-made in a red pan in the bedroom; a little table,
      covered with a green baize cloth, had been borrowed from the parlour, to
      play at cards on; and the glasses of the establishment, together with
      those which had been borrowed for the occasion from the public-house, were
      all drawn up in a tray, which was deposited on the landing outside the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the highly satisfactory nature of all these arrangements,
      there was a cloud on the countenance of Mr. Bob Sawyer, as he sat by the
      fireside. There was a sympathising expression, too, in the features of Mr.
      Ben Allen, as he gazed intently on the coals, and a tone of melancholy in
      his voice, as he said, after a long silence&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it is unlucky she should have taken it in her head to turn sour,
      just on this occasion. She might at least have waited till to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s her malevolence&mdash;that&rsquo;s her malevolence,&rsquo; returned Mr. Bob
      Sawyer vehemently. &lsquo;She says that if I can afford to give a party I ought
      to be able to pay her confounded &ldquo;little bill.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      How long has it been running?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Ben Allen. A bill, by the bye,
      is the most extraordinary locomotive engine that the genius of man ever
      produced. It would keep on running during the longest lifetime, without
      ever once stopping of its own accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only a quarter, and a month or so,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben Allen coughed hopelessly, and directed a searching look between the
      two top bars of the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be a deuced unpleasant thing if she takes it into her head to let
      out, when those fellows are here, won&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; said Mr. Ben Allen at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Horrible,&rsquo; replied Bob Sawyer, &lsquo;horrible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A low tap was heard at the room door. Mr. Bob Sawyer looked expressively
      at his friend, and bade the tapper come in; whereupon a dirty, slipshod
      girl in black cotton stockings, who might have passed for the neglected
      daughter of a superannuated dustman in very reduced circumstances, thrust
      in her head, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please, Mister Sawyer, Missis Raddle wants to speak to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Mr. Bob Sawyer could return any answer, the girl suddenly
      disappeared with a jerk, as if somebody had given her a violent pull
      behind; this mysterious exit was no sooner accomplished, than there was
      another tap at the door&mdash;a smart, pointed tap, which seemed to say,
      &lsquo;Here I am, and in I&rsquo;m coming.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bob Sawyer glanced at his friend with a look of abject apprehension,
      and once more cried, &lsquo;Come in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The permission was not at all necessary, for, before Mr. Bob Sawyer had
      uttered the words, a little, fierce woman bounced into the room, all in a
      tremble with passion, and pale with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Mr. Sawyer,&rsquo; said the little, fierce woman, trying to appear very
      calm, &lsquo;if you&rsquo;ll have the kindness to settle that little bill of mine I&rsquo;ll
      thank you, because I&rsquo;ve got my rent to pay this afternoon, and my
      landlord&rsquo;s a-waiting below now.&rsquo; Here the little woman rubbed her hands,
      and looked steadily over Mr. Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s head, at the wall behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very sorry to put you to any inconvenience, Mrs. Raddle,&rsquo; said Bob
      Sawyer deferentially, &lsquo;but&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t any inconvenience,&rsquo; replied the little woman, with a shrill
      titter. &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t want it particular before to-day; leastways, as it has
      to go to my landlord directly, it was as well for you to keep it as me.
      You promised me this afternoon, Mr. Sawyer, and every gentleman as has
      ever lived here, has kept his word, Sir, as of course anybody as calls
      himself a gentleman does.&rsquo; Mrs. Raddle tossed her head, bit her lips,
      rubbed her hands harder, and looked at the wall more steadily than ever.
      It was plain to see, as Mr. Bob Sawyer remarked in a style of Eastern
      allegory on a subsequent occasion, that she was &lsquo;getting the steam up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very sorry, Mrs. Raddle,&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer, with all imaginable
      humility, &lsquo;but the fact is, that I have been disappointed in the City
      to-day.&rsquo;&mdash;Extraordinary place that City. An astonishing number of men
      always <i>are </i>getting disappointed there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Mr. Sawyer,&rsquo; said Mrs. Raddle, planting herself firmly on a purple
      cauliflower in the Kidderminster carpet, &lsquo;and what&rsquo;s that to me, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;have no doubt, Mrs. Raddle,&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer, blinking
      this last question, &lsquo;that before the middle of next week we shall be able
      to set ourselves quite square, and go on, on a better system, afterwards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all Mrs. Raddle wanted. She had bustled up to the apartment of
      the unlucky Bob Sawyer, so bent upon going into a passion, that, in all
      probability, payment would have rather disappointed her than otherwise.
      She was in excellent order for a little relaxation of the kind, having
      just exchanged a few introductory compliments with Mr. R. in the front
      kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you suppose, Mr. Sawyer,&rsquo; said Mrs. Raddle, elevating her voice for
      the information of the neighbours&mdash;&lsquo;do you suppose that I&rsquo;m a-going
      day after day to let a fellar occupy my lodgings as never thinks of paying
      his rent, nor even the very money laid out for the fresh butter and lump
      sugar that&rsquo;s bought for his breakfast, and the very milk that&rsquo;s took in,
      at the street door? Do you suppose a hard-working and industrious woman as
      has lived in this street for twenty year (ten year over the way, and nine
      year and three-quarters in this very house) has nothing else to do but to
      work herself to death after a parcel of lazy idle fellars, that are always
      smoking and drinking, and lounging, when they ought to be glad to turn
      their hands to anything that would help &lsquo;em to pay their bills? Do you&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good soul,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Benjamin Allen soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have the goodness to keep your observashuns to yourself, Sir, I beg,&rsquo; 
      said Mrs. Raddle, suddenly arresting the rapid torrent of her speech, and
      addressing the third party with impressive slowness and solemnity. &lsquo;I am
      not aweer, Sir, that you have any right to address your conversation to
      me. I don&rsquo;t think I let these apartments to you, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you certainly did not,&rsquo; said Mr. Benjamin Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good, Sir,&rsquo; responded Mrs. Raddle, with lofty politeness. &lsquo;Then
      p&rsquo;raps, Sir, you&rsquo;ll confine yourself to breaking the arms and legs of the
      poor people in the hospitals, and keep yourself <i>to</i> yourself, Sir,
      or there may be some persons here as will make you, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you are such an unreasonable woman,&rsquo; remonstrated Mr. Benjamin Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your parding, young man,&rsquo; said Mrs. Raddle, in a cold perspiration
      of anger. &lsquo;But will you have the goodness just to call me that again,
      sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t make use of the word in any invidious sense, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Benjamin Allen, growing somewhat uneasy on his own account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your parding, young man,&rsquo; demanded Mrs. Raddle, in a louder and
      more imperative tone. &lsquo;But who do you call a woman? Did you make that
      remark to me, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, bless my heart!&rsquo; said Mr. Benjamin Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you apply that name to me, I ask of you, sir?&rsquo; interrupted Mrs.
      Raddle, with intense fierceness, throwing the door wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, of course I did,&rsquo; replied Mr. Benjamin Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, of course you did,&rsquo; said Mrs. Raddle, backing gradually to the door,
      and raising her voice to its loudest pitch, for the special behoof of Mr.
      Raddle in the kitchen. &lsquo;Yes, of course you did! And everybody knows that
      they may safely insult me in my own &lsquo;ouse while my husband sits sleeping
      downstairs, and taking no more notice than if I was a dog in the streets.
      He ought to be ashamed of himself (here Mrs. Raddle sobbed) to allow his
      wife to be treated in this way by a parcel of young cutters and carvers of
      live people&rsquo;s bodies, that disgraces the lodgings (another sob), and
      leaving her exposed to all manner of abuse; a base, faint-hearted,
      timorous wretch, that&rsquo;s afraid to come upstairs, and face the ruffinly
      creatures&mdash;that&rsquo;s afraid&mdash;that&rsquo;s afraid to come!&rsquo; Mrs. Raddle
      paused to listen whether the repetition of the taunt had roused her better
      half; and finding that it had not been successful, proceeded to descend
      the stairs with sobs innumerable; when there came a loud double knock at
      the street door; whereupon she burst into an hysterical fit of weeping,
      accompanied with dismal moans, which was prolonged until the knock had
      been repeated six times, when, in an uncontrollable burst of mental agony,
      she threw down all the umbrellas, and disappeared into the back parlour,
      closing the door after her with an awful crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does Mr. Sawyer live here?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, when the door was opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the girl, &lsquo;first floor. It&rsquo;s the door straight afore you, when
      you gets to the top of the stairs.&rsquo; Having given this instruction, the
      handmaid, who had been brought up among the aboriginal inhabitants of
      Southwark, disappeared, with the candle in her hand, down the kitchen
      stairs, perfectly satisfied that she had done everything that could
      possibly be required of her under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Snodgrass, who entered last, secured the street door, after several
      ineffectual efforts, by putting up the chain; and the friends stumbled
      upstairs, where they were received by Mr. Bob Sawyer, who had been afraid
      to go down, lest he should be waylaid by Mrs. Raddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo; said the discomfited student. &lsquo;Glad to see you&mdash;take
      care of the glasses.&rsquo; This caution was addressed to Mr. Pickwick, who had
      put his hat in the tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I beg your pardon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it, don&rsquo;t mention it,&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m rather
      confined for room here, but you must put up with all that, when you come
      to see a young bachelor. Walk in. You&rsquo;ve seen this gentleman before, I
      think?&rsquo; Mr. Pickwick shook hands with Mr. Benjamin Allen, and his friends
      followed his example. They had scarcely taken their seats when there was
      another double knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope that&rsquo;s Jack Hopkins!&rsquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer. &lsquo;Hush. Yes, it is. Come
      up, Jack; come up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A heavy footstep was heard upon the stairs, and Jack Hopkins presented
      himself. He wore a black velvet waistcoat, with thunder-and-lightning
      buttons; and a blue striped shirt, with a white false collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re late, Jack?&rsquo; said Mr. Benjamin Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Been detained at Bartholomew&rsquo;s,&rsquo; replied Hopkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anything new?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, nothing particular. Rather a good accident brought into the casualty
      ward.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What was that, sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only a man fallen out of a four pair of stairs&rsquo; window; but it&rsquo;s a very
      fair case indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean that the patient is in a fair way to recover?&rsquo; inquired Mr.
      Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Mr. Hopkins carelessly. &lsquo;No, I should rather say he
      wouldn&rsquo;t. There must be a splendid operation, though, to-morrow&mdash;magnificent
      sight if Slasher does it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You consider Mr. Slasher a good operator?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Best alive,&rsquo; replied Hopkins. &lsquo;Took a boy&rsquo;s leg out of the socket last
      week&mdash;boy ate five apples and a gingerbread cake&mdash;exactly two
      minutes after it was all over, boy said he wouldn&rsquo;t lie there to be made
      game of, and he&rsquo;d tell his mother if they didn&rsquo;t begin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pooh! That&rsquo;s nothing, that ain&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Jack Hopkins. &lsquo;Is it, Bob?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing at all,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the bye, Bob,&rsquo; said Hopkins, with a scarcely perceptible glance at Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s attentive face, &lsquo;we had a curious accident last night. A child
      was brought in, who had swallowed a necklace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Swallowed what, Sir?&rsquo; interrupted Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A necklace,&rsquo; replied Jack Hopkins. &lsquo;Not all at once, you know, that would
      be too much&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t swallow that, if the child did&mdash;eh,
      Mr. Pickwick? ha, ha!&rsquo; Mr. Hopkins appeared highly gratified with his own
      pleasantry, and continued&mdash;&lsquo;No, the way was this. Child&rsquo;s parents
      were poor people who lived in a court. Child&rsquo;s eldest sister bought a
      necklace&mdash;common necklace, made of large black wooden beads. Child
      being fond of toys, cribbed the necklace, hid it, played with it, cut the
      string, and swallowed a bead. Child thought it capital fun, went back next
      day, and swallowed another bead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless my heart,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;what a dreadful thing! I beg your
      pardon, Sir. Go on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Next day, child swallowed two beads; the day after that, he treated
      himself to three, and so on, till in a week&rsquo;s time he had got through the
      necklace&mdash;five-and-twenty beads in all. The sister, who was an
      industrious girl, and seldom treated herself to a bit of finery, cried her
      eyes out, at the loss of the necklace; looked high and low for it; but, I
      needn&rsquo;t say, didn&rsquo;t find it. A few days afterwards, the family were at
      dinner&mdash;baked shoulder of mutton, and potatoes under it&mdash;the
      child, who wasn&rsquo;t hungry, was playing about the room, when suddenly there
      was heard a devil of a noise, like a small hailstorm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, my
      boy,&rdquo; said the father. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-doin&rsquo; nothing,&rdquo; said the child. &ldquo;Well,
      don&rsquo;t do it again,&rdquo; said the father. There was a short silence, and then
      the noise began again, worse than ever. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind what I say, my
      boy,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll find yourself in bed, in something less
      than a pig&rsquo;s whisper.&rdquo; He gave the child a shake to make him obedient, and
      such a rattling ensued as nobody ever heard before. &ldquo;Why, damme, it&rsquo;s <i>in</i>
      the child!&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got the croup in the wrong place!&rdquo; &ldquo;No,
      I haven&rsquo;t, father,&rdquo; said the child, beginning to cry, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the necklace;
      I swallowed it, father.&rdquo;&mdash;The father caught the child up, and ran
      with him to the hospital; the beads in the boy&rsquo;s stomach rattling all the
      way with the jolting; and the people looking up in the air, and down in
      the cellars, to see where the unusual sound came from. He&rsquo;s in the
      hospital now,&rsquo; said Jack Hopkins, &lsquo;and he makes such a devil of a noise
      when he walks about, that they&rsquo;re obliged to muffle him in a watchman&rsquo;s
      coat, for fear he should wake the patients.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the most extraordinary case I ever heard of,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
      with an emphatic blow on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing,&rsquo; said Jack Hopkins. &lsquo;Is it, Bob?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; replied Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very singular things occur in our profession, I can assure you, Sir,&rsquo; 
      said Hopkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I should be disposed to imagine,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another knock at the door announced a large-headed young man in a black
      wig, who brought with him a scorbutic youth in a long stock. The next
      comer was a gentleman in a shirt emblazoned with pink anchors, who was
      closely followed by a pale youth with a plated watchguard. The arrival of
      a prim personage in clean linen and cloth boots rendered the party
      complete. The little table with the green baize cover was wheeled out; the
      first instalment of punch was brought in, in a white jug; and the
      succeeding three hours were devoted to <i>Vingt-et-un</i> at sixpence a
      dozen, which was only once interrupted by a slight dispute between the
      scorbutic youth and the gentleman with the pink anchors; in the course of
      which, the scorbutic youth intimated a burning desire to pull the nose of
      the gentleman with the emblems of hope; in reply to which, that individual
      expressed his decided unwillingness to accept of any &lsquo;sauce&rsquo; on gratuitous
      terms, either from the irascible young gentleman with the scorbutic
      countenance, or any other person who was ornamented with a head.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last &lsquo;natural&rsquo; had been declared, and the profit and loss account
      of fish and sixpences adjusted, to the satisfaction of all parties, Mr.
      Bob Sawyer rang for supper, and the visitors squeezed themselves into
      corners while it was getting ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not so easily got ready as some people may imagine. First of all,
      it was necessary to awaken the girl, who had fallen asleep with her face
      on the kitchen table; this took a little time, and, even when she did
      answer the bell, another quarter of an hour was consumed in fruitless
      endeavours to impart to her a faint and distant glimmering of reason. The
      man to whom the order for the oysters had been sent, had not been told to
      open them; it is a very difficult thing to open an oyster with a limp
      knife and a two-pronged fork; and very little was done in this way. Very
      little of the beef was done either; and the ham (which was also from the
      German-sausage shop round the corner) was in a similar predicament.
      However, there was plenty of porter in a tin can; and the cheese went a
      great way, for it was very strong. So upon the whole, perhaps, the supper
      was quite as good as such matters usually are.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper, another jug of punch was put upon the table, together with a
      paper of cigars, and a couple of bottles of spirits. Then there was an
      awful pause; and this awful pause was occasioned by a very common
      occurrence in this sort of place, but a very embarrassing one
      notwithstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is, the girl was washing the glasses. The establishment boasted
      four: we do not record the circumstance as at all derogatory to Mrs.
      Raddle, for there never was a lodging-house yet, that was not short of
      glasses. The landlady&rsquo;s glasses were little, thin, blown-glass tumblers,
      and those which had been borrowed from the public-house were great,
      dropsical, bloated articles, each supported on a huge gouty leg. This
      would have been in itself sufficient to have possessed the company with
      the real state of affairs; but the young woman of all work had prevented
      the possibility of any misconception arising in the mind of any gentleman
      upon the subject, by forcibly dragging every man&rsquo;s glass away, long before
      he had finished his beer, and audibly stating, despite the winks and
      interruptions of Mr. Bob Sawyer, that it was to be conveyed downstairs,
      and washed forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a very ill wind that blows nobody any good. The prim man in the
      cloth boots, who had been unsuccessfully attempting to make a joke during
      the whole time the round game lasted, saw his opportunity, and availed
      himself of it. The instant the glasses disappeared, he commenced a long
      story about a great public character, whose name he had forgotten, making
      a particularly happy reply to another eminent and illustrious individual
      whom he had never been able to identify. He enlarged at some length and
      with great minuteness upon divers collateral circumstances, distantly
      connected with the anecdote in hand, but for the life of him he couldn&rsquo;t
      recollect at that precise moment what the anecdote was, although he had
      been in the habit of telling the story with great applause for the last
      ten years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said the prim man in the cloth boots, &lsquo;it is a very
      extraordinary circumstance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry you have forgotten it,&rsquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer, glancing eagerly
      at the door, as he thought he heard the noise of glasses jingling; &lsquo;very
      sorry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So am I,&rsquo; responded the prim man, &lsquo;because I know it would have afforded
      so much amusement. Never mind; I dare say I shall manage to recollect it,
      in the course of half an hour or so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The prim man arrived at this point just as the glasses came back, when Mr.
      Bob Sawyer, who had been absorbed in attention during the whole time, said
      he should very much like to hear the end of it, for, so far as it went, it
      was, without exception, the very best story he had ever heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the tumblers restored Bob Sawyer to a degree of equanimity
      which he had not possessed since his interview with his landlady. His face
      brightened up, and he began to feel quite convivial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Betsy,&rsquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer, with great suavity, and dispersing, at
      the same time, the tumultuous little mob of glasses the girl had collected
      in the centre of the table&mdash;&lsquo;now, Betsy, the warm water; be brisk,
      there&rsquo;s a good girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t have no warm water,&rsquo; replied Betsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No warm water!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the girl, with a shake of the head which expressed a more
      decided negative than the most copious language could have conveyed.
      &lsquo;Missis Raddle said you warn&rsquo;t to have none.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The surprise depicted on the countenances of his guests imparted new
      courage to the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bring up the warm water instantly&mdash;instantly!&rsquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer,
      with desperate sternness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied the girl; &lsquo;Missis Raddle raked out the kitchen fire
      afore she went to bed, and locked up the kittle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, never mind; never mind. Pray don&rsquo;t disturb yourself about such a
      trifle,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, observing the conflict of Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s
      passions, as depicted in his countenance, &lsquo;cold water will do very well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, admirably,&rsquo; said Mr. Benjamin Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My landlady is subject to some slight attacks of mental derangement,&rsquo; 
      remarked Bob Sawyer, with a ghastly smile; &lsquo;I fear I must give her
      warning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Ben Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear I must,&rsquo; said Bob, with heroic firmness. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll pay her what I owe
      her, and give her warning to-morrow morning.&rsquo; Poor fellow! how devoutly he
      wished he could!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s heart-sickening attempts to rally under this last blow,
      communicated a dispiriting influence to the company, the greater part of
      whom, with the view of raising their spirits, attached themselves with
      extra cordiality to the cold brandy-and-water, the first perceptible
      effects of which were displayed in a renewal of hostilities between the
      scorbutic youth and the gentleman in the shirt. The belligerents vented
      their feelings of mutual contempt, for some time, in a variety of
      frownings and snortings, until at last the scorbutic youth felt it
      necessary to come to a more explicit understanding on the matter; when the
      following clear understanding took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sawyer,&rsquo; said the scorbutic youth, in a loud voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Noddy,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be very sorry, Sawyer,&rsquo; said Mr. Noddy, &lsquo;to create any
      unpleasantness at any friend&rsquo;s table, and much less at yours, Sawyer&mdash;very;
      but I must take this opportunity of informing Mr. Gunter that he is no
      gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I should be very sorry, Sawyer, to create any disturbance in the
      street in which you reside,&rsquo; said Mr. Gunter, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid I shall be
      under the necessity of alarming the neighbours by throwing the person who
      has just spoken, out o&rsquo; window.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by that, sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Noddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What I say, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Gunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to see you do it, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Noddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall <i>feel </i>me do it in half a minute, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Gunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I request that you&rsquo;ll favour me with your card, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Noddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Gunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Noddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because you&rsquo;ll stick it up over your chimney-piece, and delude your
      visitors into the false belief that a gentleman has been to see you, Sir,&rsquo; 
      replied Mr. Gunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir, a friend of mine shall wait on you in the morning,&rsquo; said Mr. Noddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir, I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you for the caution, and I&rsquo;ll leave
      particular directions with the servant to lock up the spoons,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Gunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point the remainder of the guests interposed, and remonstrated
      with both parties on the impropriety of their conduct; on which Mr. Noddy
      begged to state that his father was quite as respectable as Mr. Gunter&rsquo;s
      father; to which Mr. Gunter replied that his father was to the full as
      respectable as Mr. Noddy&rsquo;s father, and that his father&rsquo;s son was as good a
      man as Mr. Noddy, any day in the week. As this announcement seemed the
      prelude to a recommencement of the dispute, there was another interference
      on the part of the company; and a vast quantity of talking and clamouring
      ensued, in the course of which Mr. Noddy gradually allowed his feelings to
      overpower him, and professed that he had ever entertained a devoted
      personal attachment towards Mr. Gunter. To this Mr. Gunter replied that,
      upon the whole, he rather preferred Mr. Noddy to his own brother; on
      hearing which admission, Mr. Noddy magnanimously rose from his seat, and
      proffered his hand to Mr. Gunter. Mr. Gunter grasped it with affecting
      fervour; and everybody said that the whole dispute had been conducted in a
      manner which was highly honourable to both parties concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Jack Hopkins, &lsquo;just to set us going again, Bob, I don&rsquo;t mind
      singing a song.&rsquo; And Hopkins, incited thereto by tumultuous applause,
      plunged himself at once into &lsquo;The King, God bless him,&rsquo; which he sang as
      loud as he could, to a novel air, compounded of the &lsquo;Bay of Biscay,&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;A Frog he would.&rsquo; The chorus was the essence of the song; and, as each
      gentleman sang it to the tune he knew best, the effect was very striking
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the end of the chorus to the first verse, that Mr. Pickwick held
      up his hand in a listening attitude, and said, as soon as silence was
      restored&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! I beg your pardon. I thought I heard somebody calling from
      upstairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A profound silence immediately ensued; and Mr. Bob Sawyer was observed to
      turn pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I hear it now,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Have the goodness to open the
      door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was no sooner opened than all doubt on the subject was removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Sawyer! Mr. Sawyer!&rsquo; screamed a voice from the two-pair landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my landlady,&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer, looking round him with great dismay.
      &lsquo;Yes, Mrs. Raddle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by this, Mr. Sawyer?&rsquo; replied the voice, with great
      shrillness and rapidity of utterance. &lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t it enough to be swindled out
      of one&rsquo;s rent, and money lent out of pocket besides, and abused and
      insulted by your friends that dares to call themselves men, without having
      the house turned out of the window, and noise enough made to bring the
      fire-engines here, at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning?&mdash;Turn them wretches
      away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,&rsquo; said the voice of Mr. Raddle,
      which appeared to proceed from beneath some distant bed-clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ashamed of themselves!&rsquo; said Mrs. Raddle. &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go down and
      knock &lsquo;em every one downstairs? You would if you was a man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I should if I was a dozen men, my dear,&rsquo; replied Mr. Raddle pacifically,
      &lsquo;but they have the advantage of me in numbers, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ugh, you coward!&rsquo; replied Mrs. Raddle, with supreme contempt. &lsquo;<i>Do</i>
      you mean to turn them wretches out, or not, Mr. Sawyer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re going, Mrs. Raddle, they&rsquo;re going,&rsquo; said the miserable Bob. &lsquo;I am
      afraid you&rsquo;d better go,&rsquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer to his friends. &lsquo;I thought
      you were making too much noise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a very unfortunate thing,&rsquo; said the prim man. &lsquo;Just as we were
      getting so comfortable too!&rsquo; The prim man was just beginning to have a
      dawning recollection of the story he had forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s hardly to be borne,&rsquo; said the prim man, looking round. &lsquo;Hardly to be
      borne, is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not to be endured,&rsquo; replied Jack Hopkins; &lsquo;let&rsquo;s have the other verse,
      Bob. Come, here goes!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, Jack, don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; interposed Bob Sawyer; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a capital song, but I
      am afraid we had better not have the other verse. They are very violent
      people, the people of the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I step upstairs, and pitch into the landlord?&rsquo; inquired Hopkins,
      &lsquo;or keep on ringing the bell, or go and groan on the staircase? You may
      command me, Bob.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very much indebted to you for your friendship and good-nature,
      Hopkins,&rsquo; said the wretched Mr. Bob Sawyer, &lsquo;but I think the best plan to
      avoid any further dispute is for us to break up at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Mr. Sawyer,&rsquo; screamed the shrill voice of Mrs. Raddle, &lsquo;are them
      brutes going?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re only looking for their hats, Mrs. Raddle,&rsquo; said Bob; &lsquo;they are
      going directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going!&rsquo; said Mrs. Raddle, thrusting her nightcap over the banisters just
      as Mr. Pickwick, followed by Mr. Tupman, emerged from the sitting-room.
      &lsquo;Going! what did they ever come for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; remonstrated Mr. Pickwick, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get along with you, old wretch!&rsquo; replied Mrs. Raddle, hastily withdrawing
      the nightcap. &lsquo;Old enough to be his grandfather, you willin! You&rsquo;re worse
      than any of &lsquo;em.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick found it in vain to protest his innocence, so hurried
      downstairs into the street, whither he was closely followed by Mr. Tupman,
      Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass. Mr. Ben Allen, who was dismally depressed
      with spirits and agitation, accompanied them as far as London Bridge, and
      in the course of the walk confided to Mr. Winkle, as an especially
      eligible person to intrust the secret to, that he was resolved to cut the
      throat of any gentleman, except Mr. Bob Sawyer, who should aspire to the
      affections of his sister Arabella. Having expressed his determination to
      perform this painful duty of a brother with proper firmness, he burst into
      tears, knocked his hat over his eyes, and, making the best of his way
      back, knocked double knocks at the door of the Borough Market office, and
      took short naps on the steps alternately, until daybreak, under the firm
      impression that he lived there, and had forgotten the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitors having all departed, in compliance with the rather pressing
      request of Mrs. Raddle, the luckless Mr. Bob Sawyer was left alone, to
      meditate on the probable events of to-morrow, and the pleasures of the
      evening.

      CHAPTER XXXIII. MR. WELLER THE ELDER DELIVERS SOME CRITICAL SENTIMENTS
      RESPECTING LITERARY COMPOSITION; AND, ASSISTED BY HIS SON SAMUEL, PAYS A
      SMALL INSTALMENT OF RETALIATION TO THE ACCOUNT OF THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN
      WITH THE RED NOSE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he morning of the
      thirteenth of February, which the readers of this authentic narrative
      know, as well as we do, to have been the day immediately preceding that
      which was appointed for the trial of Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s action, was a busy
      time for Mr. Samuel Weller, who was perpetually engaged in travelling from
      the George and Vulture to Mr. Perker&rsquo;s chambers and back again, from and
      between the hours of nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning and two in the afternoon,
      both inclusive. Not that there was anything whatever to be done, for the
      consultation had taken place, and the course of proceeding to be adopted,
      had been finally determined on; but Mr. Pickwick being in a most extreme
      state of excitement, persevered in constantly sending small notes to his
      attorney, merely containing the inquiry, &lsquo;Dear Perker. Is all going on
      well?&rsquo; to which Mr. Perker invariably forwarded the reply, &lsquo;Dear Pickwick.
      As well as possible&rsquo;; the fact being, as we have already hinted, that
      there was nothing whatever to go on, either well or ill, until the sitting
      of the court on the following morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      But people who go voluntarily to law, or are taken forcibly there, for the
      first time, may be allowed to labour under some temporary irritation and
      anxiety; and Sam, with a due allowance for the frailties of human nature,
      obeyed all his master&rsquo;s behests with that imperturbable good-humour and
      unruffable composure which formed one of his most striking and amiable
      characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam had solaced himself with a most agreeable little dinner, and was
      waiting at the bar for the glass of warm mixture in which Mr. Pickwick had
      requested him to drown the fatigues of his morning&rsquo;s walks, when a young
      boy of about three feet high, or thereabouts, in a hairy cap and fustian
      overalls, whose garb bespoke a laudable ambition to attain in time the
      elevation of an hostler, entered the passage of the George and Vulture,
      and looked first up the stairs, and then along the passage, and then into
      the bar, as if in search of somebody to whom he bore a commission;
      whereupon the barmaid, conceiving it not improbable that the said
      commission might be directed to the tea or table spoons of the
      establishment, accosted the boy with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, young man, what do you want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there anybody here, named Sam?&rsquo; inquired the youth, in a loud voice of
      treble quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the t&rsquo;other name?&rsquo; said Sam Weller, looking round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How should I know?&rsquo; briskly replied the young gentleman below the hairy
      cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a sharp boy, you are,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller; &lsquo;only I wouldn&rsquo;t show that
      wery fine edge too much, if I was you, in case anybody took it off. What
      do you mean by comin&rsquo; to a hot-el, and asking arter Sam, vith as much
      politeness as a vild Indian?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Cos an old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n told me to,&rsquo; replied the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n?&rsquo; inquired Sam, with deep disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Him as drives a Ipswich coach, and uses our parlour,&rsquo; rejoined the boy.
      &lsquo;He told me yesterday mornin&rsquo; to come to the George and Wultur this
      arternoon, and ask for Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my father, my dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, turning with an explanatory
      air to the young lady in the bar; &lsquo;blessed if I think he hardly knows wot
      my other name is. Well, young brockiley sprout, wot then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why then,&rsquo; said the boy, &lsquo;you was to come to him at six o&rsquo;clock to our
      &lsquo;ouse, &lsquo;cos he wants to see you&mdash;Blue Boar, Leaden&rsquo;all Markit. Shall
      I say you&rsquo;re comin&rsquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may wenture on that &lsquo;ere statement, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam. And thus
      empowered, the young gentleman walked away, awakening all the echoes in
      George Yard as he did so, with several chaste and extremely correct
      imitations of a drover&rsquo;s whistle, delivered in a tone of peculiar richness
      and volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller having obtained leave of absence from Mr. Pickwick, who, in his
      then state of excitement and worry, was by no means displeased at being
      left alone, set forth, long before the appointed hour, and having plenty
      of time at his disposal, sauntered down as far as the Mansion House, where
      he paused and contemplated, with a face of great calmness and philosophy,
      the numerous cads and drivers of short stages who assemble near that
      famous place of resort, to the great terror and confusion of the old-lady
      population of these realms. Having loitered here, for half an hour or so,
      Mr. Weller turned, and began wending his way towards Leadenhall Market,
      through a variety of by-streets and courts. As he was sauntering away his
      spare time, and stopped to look at almost every object that met his gaze,
      it is by no means surprising that Mr. Weller should have paused before a
      small stationer&rsquo;s and print-seller&rsquo;s window; but without further
      explanation it does appear surprising that his eyes should have no sooner
      rested on certain pictures which were exposed for sale therein, than he
      gave a sudden start, smote his right leg with great vehemence, and
      exclaimed, with energy, &lsquo;if it hadn&rsquo;t been for this, I should ha&rsquo; forgot
      all about it, till it was too late!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The particular picture on which Sam Weller&rsquo;s eyes were fixed, as he said
      this, was a highly-coloured representation of a couple of human hearts
      skewered together with an arrow, cooking before a cheerful fire, while a
      male and female cannibal in modern attire, the gentleman being clad in a
      blue coat and white trousers, and the lady in a deep red pelisse with a
      parasol of the same, were approaching the meal with hungry eyes, up a
      serpentine gravel path leading thereunto. A decidedly indelicate young
      gentleman, in a pair of wings and nothing else, was depicted as
      superintending the cooking; a representation of the spire of the church in
      Langham Place, London, appeared in the distance; and the whole formed a
      &lsquo;valentine,&rsquo; of which, as a written inscription in the window testified,
      there was a large assortment within, which the shopkeeper pledged himself
      to dispose of, to his countrymen generally, at the reduced rate of
      one-and-sixpence each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should ha&rsquo; forgot it; I should certainly ha&rsquo; forgot it!&rsquo; said Sam; so
      saying, he at once stepped into the stationer&rsquo;s shop, and requested to be
      served with a sheet of the best gilt-edged letter-paper, and a hard-nibbed
      pen which could be warranted not to splutter. These articles having been
      promptly supplied, he walked on direct towards Leadenhall Market at a good
      round pace, very different from his recent lingering one. Looking round
      him, he there beheld a signboard on which the painter&rsquo;s art had delineated
      something remotely resembling a cerulean elephant with an aquiline nose in
      lieu of trunk. Rightly conjecturing that this was the Blue Boar himself,
      he stepped into the house, and inquired concerning his parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t be here this three-quarters of an hour or more,&rsquo; said the young
      lady who superintended the domestic arrangements of the Blue Boar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good, my dear,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;Let me have nine-penn&rsquo;oth o&rsquo; 
      brandy-and-water luke, and the inkstand, will you, miss?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The brandy-and-water luke, and the inkstand, having been carried into the
      little parlour, and the young lady having carefully flattened down the
      coals to prevent their blazing, and carried away the poker to preclude the
      possibility of the fire being stirred, without the full privity and
      concurrence of the Blue Boar being first had and obtained, Sam Weller sat
      himself down in a box near the stove, and pulled out the sheet of
      gilt-edged letter-paper, and the hard-nibbed pen. Then looking carefully
      at the pen to see that there were no hairs in it, and dusting down the
      table, so that there might be no crumbs of bread under the paper, Sam
      tucked up the cuffs of his coat, squared his elbows, and composed himself
      to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ladies and gentlemen who are not in the habit of devoting themselves
      practically to the science of penmanship, writing a letter is no very easy
      task; it being always considered necessary in such cases for the writer to
      recline his head on his left arm, so as to place his eyes as nearly as
      possible on a level with the paper, and, while glancing sideways at the
      letters he is constructing, to form with his tongue imaginary characters
      to correspond. These motions, although unquestionably of the greatest
      assistance to original composition, retard in some degree the progress of
      the writer; and Sam had unconsciously been a full hour and a half writing
      words in small text, smearing out wrong letters with his little finger,
      and putting in new ones which required going over very often to render
      them visible through the old blots, when he was roused by the opening of
      the door and the entrance of his parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell, Sammy,&rsquo; said the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell, my Prooshan Blue,&rsquo; responded the son, laying down his pen. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s
      the last bulletin about mother-in-law?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Veller passed a very good night, but is uncommon perwerse, and
      unpleasant this mornin&rsquo;. Signed upon oath, Tony Veller, Esquire. That&rsquo;s
      the last vun as was issued, Sammy,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, untying his shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No better yet?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the symptoms aggerawated,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, shaking his head. &lsquo;But
      wot&rsquo;s that, you&rsquo;re a-doin&rsquo; of? Pursuit of knowledge under difficulties,
      Sammy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done now,&rsquo; said Sam, with slight embarrassment; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been
      a-writin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I see,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Not to any young &lsquo;ooman, I hope, Sammy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s no use a-sayin&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied Sam; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a walentine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A what!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Weller, apparently horror-stricken by the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A walentine,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Samivel, Samivel,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, in reproachful accents, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      think you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; done it. Arter the warnin&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve had o&rsquo; your father&rsquo;s
      wicious propensities; arter all I&rsquo;ve said to you upon this here wery
      subject; arter actiwally seein&rsquo; and bein&rsquo; in the company o&rsquo; your own
      mother-in-law, vich I should ha&rsquo; thought wos a moral lesson as no man
      could never ha&rsquo; forgotten to his dyin&rsquo; day! I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; done
      it, Sammy, I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; done it!&rsquo; These reflections were too
      much for the good old man. He raised Sam&rsquo;s tumbler to his lips and drank
      off its contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s the matter now?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nev&rsquo;r mind, Sammy,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, &lsquo;it&rsquo;ll be a wery agonisin&rsquo; trial
      to me at my time of life, but I&rsquo;m pretty tough, that&rsquo;s vun consolation, as
      the wery old turkey remarked wen the farmer said he wos afeerd he should
      be obliged to kill him for the London market.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20075.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;ll be a trial?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To see you married, Sammy&mdash;to see you a dilluded wictim, and
      thinkin&rsquo; in your innocence that it&rsquo;s all wery capital,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Weller. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a dreadful trial to a father&rsquo;s feelin&rsquo;s, that &lsquo;ere, Sammy&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to get married, don&rsquo;t you fret
      yourself about that; I know you&rsquo;re a judge of these things. Order in your
      pipe and I&rsquo;ll read you the letter. There!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot distinctly say whether it was the prospect of the pipe, or the
      consolatory reflection that a fatal disposition to get married ran in the
      family, and couldn&rsquo;t be helped, which calmed Mr. Weller&rsquo;s feelings, and
      caused his grief to subside. We should be rather disposed to say that the
      result was attained by combining the two sources of consolation, for he
      repeated the second in a low tone, very frequently; ringing the bell
      meanwhile, to order in the first. He then divested himself of his upper
      coat; and lighting the pipe and placing himself in front of the fire with
      his back towards it, so that he could feel its full heat, and recline
      against the mantel-piece at the same time, turned towards Sam, and, with a
      countenance greatly mollified by the softening influence of tobacco,
      requested him to &lsquo;fire away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam dipped his pen into the ink to be ready for any corrections, and began
      with a very theatrical air&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Lovely&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, ringing the bell. &lsquo;A double glass o&rsquo; the
      inwariable, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, Sir,&rsquo; replied the girl; who with great quickness appeared,
      vanished, returned, and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They seem to know your ways here,&rsquo; observed Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied his father, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been here before, in my time. Go on,
      Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Lovely creetur,&rdquo;&rsquo; repeated Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t in poetry, is it?&rsquo; interposed his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery glad to hear it,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Poetry&rsquo;s unnat&rsquo;ral; no man ever
      talked poetry &lsquo;cept a beadle on boxin&rsquo;-day, or Warren&rsquo;s blackin&rsquo;, or
      Rowland&rsquo;s oil, or some of them low fellows; never you let yourself down to
      talk poetry, my boy. Begin agin, Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller resumed his pipe with critical solemnity, and Sam once more
      commenced, and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Lovely creetur I feel myself a damned&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That ain&rsquo;t proper,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, taking his pipe from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; it ain&rsquo;t &ldquo;damned,&rdquo;&rsquo; observed Sam, holding the letter up to the light,
      &lsquo;it&rsquo;s &ldquo;shamed,&rdquo; there&rsquo;s a blot there&mdash;&ldquo;I feel myself ashamed.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Go on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Feel myself ashamed, and completely cir&mdash;&rsquo; I forget what this here
      word is,&rsquo; said Sam, scratching his head with the pen, in vain attempts to
      remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you look at it, then?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I am a-lookin&rsquo; at it,&rsquo; replied Sam, &lsquo;but there&rsquo;s another blot. Here&rsquo;s
      a &ldquo;c,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;i,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;d.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Circumwented, p&rsquo;raps,&rsquo; suggested Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t that,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;&ldquo;circumscribed&rdquo;; that&rsquo;s it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That ain&rsquo;t as good a word as &ldquo;circumwented,&rdquo; Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think not?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothin&rsquo; like it,&rsquo; replied his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But don&rsquo;t you think it means more?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell p&rsquo;raps it&rsquo;s a more tenderer word,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, after a few
      moments&rsquo; reflection. &lsquo;Go on, Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Feel myself ashamed and completely circumscribed in a-dressin&rsquo; of you,
      for you are a nice gal and nothin&rsquo; but it.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a wery pretty sentiment,&rsquo; said the elder Mr. Weller, removing his
      pipe to make way for the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I think it is rayther good,&rsquo; observed Sam, highly flattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot I like in that &lsquo;ere style of writin&rsquo;,&rsquo; said the elder Mr. Weller,
      &lsquo;is, that there ain&rsquo;t no callin&rsquo; names in it&mdash;no Wenuses, nor nothin&rsquo; 
      o&rsquo; that kind. Wot&rsquo;s the good o&rsquo; callin&rsquo; a young &lsquo;ooman a Wenus or a angel,
      Sammy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! what, indeed?&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You might jist as well call her a griffin, or a unicorn, or a king&rsquo;s arms
      at once, which is wery well known to be a collection o&rsquo; fabulous animals,&rsquo; 
      added Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just as well,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drive on, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam complied with the request, and proceeded as follows; his father
      continuing to smoke, with a mixed expression of wisdom and complacency,
      which was particularly edifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Afore I see you, I thought all women was alike.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So they are,&rsquo; observed the elder Mr. Weller parenthetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;But now,&rdquo;&rsquo; continued Sam, &lsquo;&ldquo;now I find what a reg&rsquo;lar soft-headed,
      inkred&rsquo;lous turnip I must ha&rsquo; been; for there ain&rsquo;t nobody like you,
      though I like you better than nothin&rsquo; at all.&rdquo; I thought it best to make
      that rayther strong,&rsquo; said Sam, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller nodded approvingly, and Sam resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;So I take the privilidge of the day, Mary, my dear&mdash;as the
      gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n in difficulties did, ven he valked out of a Sunday&mdash;to tell
      you that the first and only time I see you, your likeness was took on my
      hart in much quicker time and brighter colours than ever a likeness was
      took by the profeel macheen (wich p&rsquo;raps you may have heerd on Mary my
      dear) altho it <i>does </i>finish a portrait and put the frame and glass
      on complete, with a hook at the end to hang it up by, and all in two
      minutes and a quarter.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afeerd that werges on the poetical, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller
      dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied Sam, reading on very quickly, to avoid contesting
      the point&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Except of me Mary my dear as your walentine and think over what I&rsquo;ve
      said.&mdash;My dear Mary I will now conclude.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s rather a Sudden pull-up, ain&rsquo;t it, Sammy?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit on it,&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;she&rsquo;ll vish there wos more, and that&rsquo;s the
      great art o&rsquo; letter-writin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; in that; and I wish your
      mother-in-law &lsquo;ud only conduct her conwersation on the same gen-teel
      principle. Ain&rsquo;t you a-goin&rsquo; to sign it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the difficulty,&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to sign it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sign it&mdash;&ldquo;Veller&rdquo;,&rsquo; said the oldest surviving proprietor of that
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t do,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;Never sign a walentine with your own name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sign it &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; then,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a wery good name, and a
      easy one to spell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The wery thing,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;I <i>could </i>end with a werse; what do you
      think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like it, Sam,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Weller. &lsquo;I never know&rsquo;d a respectable
      coachman as wrote poetry, &lsquo;cept one, as made an affectin&rsquo; copy o&rsquo; werses
      the night afore he was hung for a highway robbery; and he wos only a
      Cambervell man, so even that&rsquo;s no rule.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sam was not to be dissuaded from the poetical idea that had occurred
      to him, so he signed the letter&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;Your love-sick
       Pickwick.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      And having folded it, in a very intricate manner, squeezed a downhill
      direction in one corner: &lsquo;To Mary, Housemaid, at Mr. Nupkins&rsquo;s, Mayor&rsquo;s,
      Ipswich, Suffolk&rsquo;; and put it into his pocket, wafered, and ready for the
      general post. This important business having been transacted, Mr. Weller
      the elder proceeded to open that, on which he had summoned his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The first matter relates to your governor, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s
      a-goin&rsquo; to be tried to-morrow, ain&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The trial&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo; on,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, &lsquo;Now I s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;ll want to call some witnesses
      to speak to his character, or p&rsquo;rhaps to prove a alleybi. I&rsquo;ve been
      a-turnin&rsquo; the bis&rsquo;ness over in my mind, and he may make his-self easy,
      Sammy. I&rsquo;ve got some friends as&rsquo;ll do either for him, but my adwice &lsquo;ud be
      this here&mdash;never mind the character, and stick to the alleybi.
      Nothing like a alleybi, Sammy, nothing.&rsquo; Mr. Weller looked very profound
      as he delivered this legal opinion; and burying his nose in his tumbler,
      winked over the top thereof, at his astonished son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what do you mean?&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a-goin&rsquo; to be
      tried at the Old Bailey, do you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That ain&rsquo;t no part of the present consideration, Sammy,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Weller. &lsquo;Verever he&rsquo;s a-goin&rsquo; to be tried, my boy, a alleybi&rsquo;s the thing
      to get him off. Ve got Tom Vildspark off that &lsquo;ere manslaughter, with a
      alleybi, ven all the big vigs to a man said as nothing couldn&rsquo;t save him.
      And my &lsquo;pinion is, Sammy, that if your governor don&rsquo;t prove a alleybi,
      he&rsquo;ll be what the Italians call reg&rsquo;larly flummoxed, and that&rsquo;s all about
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the elder Mr. Weller entertained a firm and unalterable conviction that
      the Old Bailey was the supreme court of judicature in this country, and
      that its rules and forms of proceeding regulated and controlled the
      practice of all other courts of justice whatsoever, he totally disregarded
      the assurances and arguments of his son, tending to show that the alibi
      was inadmissible; and vehemently protested that Mr. Pickwick was being
      &lsquo;wictimised.&rsquo; Finding that it was of no use to discuss the matter further,
      Sam changed the subject, and inquired what the second topic was, on which
      his revered parent wished to consult him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a pint o&rsquo; domestic policy, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller. &lsquo;This here
      Stiggins&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Red-nosed man?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wery same,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller. &lsquo;This here red-nosed man, Sammy,
      wisits your mother-in-law vith a kindness and constancy I never see
      equalled. He&rsquo;s sitch a friend o&rsquo; the family, Sammy, that wen he&rsquo;s avay
      from us, he can&rsquo;t be comfortable unless he has somethin&rsquo; to remember us
      by.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I&rsquo;d give him somethin&rsquo; as &lsquo;ud turpentine and beeswax his memory for
      the next ten years or so, if I wos you,&rsquo; interposed Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop a minute,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller; &lsquo;I wos a-going to say, he always brings
      now, a flat bottle as holds about a pint and a half, and fills it vith the
      pine-apple rum afore he goes avay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And empties it afore he comes back, I s&rsquo;pose?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clean!&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; &lsquo;never leaves nothin&rsquo; in it but the cork and
      the smell; trust him for that, Sammy. Now, these here fellows, my boy, are
      a-goin&rsquo; to-night to get up the monthly meetin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the Brick Lane Branch o&rsquo; 
      the United Grand Junction Ebenezer Temperance Association. Your
      mother-in-law wos a-goin&rsquo;, Sammy, but she&rsquo;s got the rheumatics, and can&rsquo;t;
      and I, Sammy&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got the two tickets as wos sent her.&rsquo; Mr. Weller
      communicated this secret with great glee, and winked so indefatigably
      after doing so, that Sam began to think he must have got the <i>Tic
      Doloureux</i> in his right eyelid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said that young gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; continued his progenitor, looking round him very cautiously, &lsquo;you
      and I&rsquo;ll go, punctiwal to the time. The deputy-shepherd won&rsquo;t, Sammy; the
      deputy-shepherd won&rsquo;t.&rsquo; Here Mr. Weller was seized with a paroxysm of
      chuckles, which gradually terminated in as near an approach to a choke as
      an elderly gentleman can, with safety, sustain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I never see sitch an old ghost in all my born days,&rsquo; exclaimed Sam,
      rubbing the old gentleman&rsquo;s back, hard enough to set him on fire with the
      friction. &lsquo;What are you a-laughin&rsquo; at, corpilence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, looking round him with increased caution,
      and speaking in a whisper. &lsquo;Two friends o&rsquo; mine, as works the Oxford Road,
      and is up to all kinds o&rsquo; games, has got the deputy-shepherd safe in tow,
      Sammy; and ven he does come to the Ebenezer Junction (vich he&rsquo;s sure to
      do: for they&rsquo;ll see him to the door, and shove him in, if necessary),
      he&rsquo;ll be as far gone in rum-and-water, as ever he wos at the Markis o&rsquo; 
      Granby, Dorkin&rsquo;, and that&rsquo;s not sayin&rsquo; a little neither.&rsquo; And with this,
      Mr. Weller once more laughed immoderately, and once more relapsed into a
      state of partial suffocation, in consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could have been more in accordance with Sam Weller&rsquo;s feelings than
      the projected exposure of the real propensities and qualities of the
      red-nosed man; and it being very near the appointed hour of meeting, the
      father and son took their way at once to Brick Lane, Sam not forgetting to
      drop his letter into a general post-office as they walked along.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monthly meetings of the Brick Lane Branch of the United Grand Junction
      Ebenezer Temperance Association were held in a large room, pleasantly and
      airily situated at the top of a safe and commodious ladder. The president
      was the straight-walking Mr. Anthony Humm, a converted fireman, now a
      schoolmaster, and occasionally an itinerant preacher; and the secretary
      was Mr. Jonas Mudge, chandler&rsquo;s shopkeeper, an enthusiastic and
      disinterested vessel, who sold tea to the members. Previous to the
      commencement of business, the ladies sat upon forms, and drank tea, till
      such time as they considered it expedient to leave off; and a large wooden
      money-box was conspicuously placed upon the green baize cloth of the
      business-table, behind which the secretary stood, and acknowledged, with a
      gracious smile, every addition to the rich vein of copper which lay
      concealed within.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this particular occasion the women drank tea to a most alarming extent;
      greatly to the horror of Mr. Weller, senior, who, utterly regardless of
      all Sam&rsquo;s admonitory nudgings, stared about him in every direction with
      the most undisguised astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sammy,&rsquo; whispered Mr. Weller, &lsquo;if some o&rsquo; these here people don&rsquo;t want
      tappin&rsquo; to-morrow mornin&rsquo;, I ain&rsquo;t your father, and that&rsquo;s wot it is. Why,
      this here old lady next me is a-drowndin&rsquo; herself in tea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Be quiet, can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; murmured Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; whispered Mr. Weller, a moment afterwards, in a tone of deep
      agitation, &lsquo;mark my vords, my boy. If that &lsquo;ere secretary fellow keeps on
      for only five minutes more, he&rsquo;ll blow hisself up with toast and water.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, let him, if he likes,&rsquo; replied Sam; &lsquo;it ain&rsquo;t no bis&rsquo;ness o&rsquo; 
      yourn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If this here lasts much longer, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, in the same low
      voice, &lsquo;I shall feel it my duty, as a human bein&rsquo;, to rise and address the
      cheer. There&rsquo;s a young &lsquo;ooman on the next form but two, as has drunk nine
      breakfast cups and a half; and she&rsquo;s a-swellin&rsquo; wisibly before my wery
      eyes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There is little doubt that Mr. Weller would have carried his benevolent
      intention into immediate execution, if a great noise, occasioned by
      putting up the cups and saucers, had not very fortunately announced that
      the tea-drinking was over. The crockery having been removed, the table
      with the green baize cover was carried out into the centre of the room,
      and the business of the evening was commenced by a little emphatic man,
      with a bald head and drab shorts, who suddenly rushed up the ladder, at
      the imminent peril of snapping the two little legs incased in the drab
      shorts, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ladies and gentlemen, I move our excellent brother, Mr. Anthony Humm,
      into the chair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies waved a choice selection of pocket-handkerchiefs at this
      proposition; and the impetuous little man literally moved Mr. Humm into
      the chair, by taking him by the shoulders and thrusting him into a
      mahogany-frame which had once represented that article of furniture. The
      waving of handkerchiefs was renewed; and Mr. Humm, who was a sleek,
      white-faced man, in a perpetual perspiration, bowed meekly, to the great
      admiration of the females, and formally took his seat. Silence was then
      proclaimed by the little man in the drab shorts, and Mr. Humm rose and
      said&mdash;That, with the permission of his Brick Lane Branch brothers and
      sisters, then and there present, the secretary would read the report of
      the Brick Lane Branch committee; a proposition which was again received
      with a demonstration of pocket-handkerchiefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secretary having sneezed in a very impressive manner, and the cough
      which always seizes an assembly, when anything particular is going to be
      done, having been duly performed, the following document was read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE BRICK LANE BRANCH OF THE UNITED GRAND
      JUNCTION EBENEZER TEMPERANCE ASSOCIATION
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your committee have pursued their grateful labours during the past month,
      and have the unspeakable pleasure of reporting the following additional
      cases of converts to Temperance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;H. Walker, tailor, wife, and two children. When in better circumstances,
      owns to having been in the constant habit of drinking ale and beer; says
      he is not certain whether he did not twice a week, for twenty years, taste
      &ldquo;dog&rsquo;s nose,&rdquo; which your committee find upon inquiry, to be compounded of
      warm porter, moist sugar, gin, and nutmeg (a groan, and &lsquo;So it is!&rsquo; from
      an elderly female). Is now out of work and penniless; thinks it must be
      the porter (cheers) or the loss of the use of his right hand; is not
      certain which, but thinks it very likely that, if he had drunk nothing but
      water all his life, his fellow-workman would never have stuck a rusty
      needle in him, and thereby occasioned his accident (tremendous cheering).
      Has nothing but cold water to drink, and never feels thirsty (great
      applause).
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Betsy Martin, widow, one child, and one eye. Goes out charing and
      washing, by the day; never had more than one eye, but knows her mother
      drank bottled stout, and shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if that caused it (immense
      cheering). Thinks it not impossible that if she had always abstained from
      spirits she might have had two eyes by this time (tremendous applause).
      Used, at every place she went to, to have eighteen-pence a day, a pint of
      porter, and a glass of spirits; but since she became a member of the Brick
      Lane Branch, has always demanded three-and-sixpence (the announcement of
      this most interesting fact was received with deafening enthusiasm).
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Henry Beller was for many years toast-master at various corporation
      dinners, during which time he drank a great deal of foreign wine; may
      sometimes have carried a bottle or two home with him; is not quite certain
      of that, but is sure if he did, that he drank the contents. Feels very low
      and melancholy, is very feverish, and has a constant thirst upon him;
      thinks it must be the wine he used to drink (cheers). Is out of employ
      now; and never touches a drop of foreign wine by any chance (tremendous
      plaudits).
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thomas Burton is purveyor of cat&rsquo;s meat to the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs,
      and several members of the Common Council (the announcement of this
      gentleman&rsquo;s name was received with breathless interest). Has a wooden leg;
      finds a wooden leg expensive, going over the stones; used to wear
      second-hand wooden legs, and drink a glass of hot gin-and-water regularly
      every night&mdash;sometimes two (deep sighs). Found the second-hand wooden
      legs split and rot very quickly; is firmly persuaded that their
      constitution was undermined by the gin-and-water (prolonged cheering).
      Buys new wooden legs now, and drinks nothing but water and weak tea. The
      new legs last twice as long as the others used to do, and he attributes
      this solely to his temperate habits (triumphant cheers).&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony Humm now moved that the assembly do regale itself with a song.
      With a view to their rational and moral enjoyment, Brother Mordlin had
      adapted the beautiful words of &lsquo;Who hasn&rsquo;t heard of a Jolly Young
      Waterman?&rsquo; to the tune of the Old Hundredth, which he would request them
      to join him in singing (great applause). He might take that opportunity of
      expressing his firm persuasion that the late Mr. Dibdin, seeing the errors
      of his former life, had written that song to show the advantages of
      abstinence. It was a temperance song (whirlwinds of cheers). The neatness
      of the young man&rsquo;s attire, the dexterity of his feathering, the enviable
      state of mind which enabled him in the beautiful words of the poet, to
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Row along, thinking of nothing at all,&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      all combined to prove that he must have been a water-drinker (cheers). Oh,
      what a state of virtuous jollity! (rapturous cheering). And what was the
      young man&rsquo;s reward? Let all young men present mark this:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;The maidens all flocked to his boat so readily.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      (Loud cheers, in which the ladies joined.) What a bright example! The
      sisterhood, the maidens, flocking round the young waterman, and urging him
      along the stream of duty and of temperance. But, was it the maidens of
      humble life only, who soothed, consoled, and supported him? No!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;He was always first oars with the fine city ladies.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      (Immense cheering.) The soft sex to a man&mdash;he begged pardon, to a
      female&mdash;rallied round the young waterman, and turned with disgust
      from the drinker of spirits (cheers). The Brick Lane Branch brothers were
      watermen (cheers and laughter). That room was their boat; that audience
      were the maidens; and he (Mr. Anthony Humm), however unworthily, was
      &lsquo;first oars&rsquo; (unbounded applause).
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot does he mean by the soft sex, Sammy?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller, in a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The womin,&rsquo; said Sam, in the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He ain&rsquo;t far out there, Sammy,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; &lsquo;they <i>must </i>be
      a soft sex&mdash;a wery soft sex, indeed&mdash;if they let themselves be
      gammoned by such fellers as him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Any further observations from the indignant old gentleman were cut short
      by the announcement of the song, which Mr. Anthony Humm gave out two lines
      at a time, for the information of such of his hearers as were unacquainted
      with the legend. While it was being sung, the little man with the drab
      shorts disappeared; he returned immediately on its conclusion, and
      whispered Mr. Anthony Humm, with a face of the deepest importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friends,&rsquo; said Mr. Humm, holding up his hand in a deprecatory manner,
      to bespeak the silence of such of the stout old ladies as were yet a line
      or two behind; &lsquo;my friends, a delegate from the Dorking Branch of our
      society, Brother Stiggins, attends below.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Out came the pocket-handkerchiefs again, in greater force than ever; for
      Mr. Stiggins was excessively popular among the female constituency of
      Brick Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He may approach, I think,&rsquo; said Mr. Humm, looking round him, with a fat
      smile. &lsquo;Brother Tadger, let him come forth and greet us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man in the drab shorts who answered to the name of Brother
      Tadger, bustled down the ladder with great speed, and was immediately
      afterwards heard tumbling up with the Reverend Mr. Stiggins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo;, Sammy,&rsquo; whispered Mr. Weller, purple in the countenance
      with suppressed laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; to me,&rsquo; replied Sam, &lsquo;for I can&rsquo;t bear it. He&rsquo;s close
      to the door. I hear him a-knockin&rsquo; his head again the lath and plaster
      now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Sam Weller spoke, the little door flew open, and Brother Tadger
      appeared, closely followed by the Reverend Mr. Stiggins, who no sooner
      entered, than there was a great clapping of hands, and stamping of feet,
      and flourishing of handkerchiefs; to all of which manifestations of
      delight, Brother Stiggins returned no other acknowledgment than staring
      with a wild eye, and a fixed smile, at the extreme top of the wick of the
      candle on the table, swaying his body to and fro, meanwhile, in a very
      unsteady and uncertain manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you unwell, Brother Stiggins?&rsquo; whispered Mr. Anthony Humm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am all right, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Stiggins, in a tone in which ferocity
      was blended with an extreme thickness of utterance; &lsquo;I am all right, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, very well,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Anthony Humm, retreating a few paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe no man here has ventured to say that I am not all right, Sir?&rsquo; 
      said Mr. Stiggins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, certainly not,&rsquo; said Mr. Humm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should advise him not to, Sir; I should advise him not,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Stiggins.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the audience were perfectly silent, and waited with some
      anxiety for the resumption of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you address the meeting, brother?&rsquo; said Mr. Humm, with a smile of
      invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Stiggins; &lsquo;No, sir. I will not, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting looked at each other with raised eyelids; and a murmur of
      astonishment ran through the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Stiggins, unbuttoning his coat, and
      speaking very loudly&mdash;&lsquo;it&rsquo;s my opinion, sir, that this meeting is
      drunk, sir. Brother Tadger, sir!&rsquo; said Mr. Stiggins, suddenly increasing
      in ferocity, and turning sharp round on the little man in the drab shorts,
      &lsquo;<i>you </i>are drunk, sir!&rsquo; With this, Mr. Stiggins, entertaining a
      praiseworthy desire to promote the sobriety of the meeting, and to exclude
      therefrom all improper characters, hit Brother Tadger on the summit of the
      nose with such unerring aim, that the drab shorts disappeared like a flash
      of lightning. Brother Tadger had been knocked, head first, down the
      ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, the women set up a loud and dismal screaming; and rushing in
      small parties before their favourite brothers, flung their arms around
      them to preserve them from danger. An instance of affection, which had
      nearly proved fatal to Humm, who, being extremely popular, was all but
      suffocated, by the crowd of female devotees that hung about his neck, and
      heaped caresses upon him. The greater part of the lights were quickly put
      out, and nothing but noise and confusion resounded on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, taking off his greatcoat with much
      deliberation, &lsquo;just you step out, and fetch in a watchman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And wot are you a-goin&rsquo; to do, the while?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never you mind me, Sammy,&rsquo; replied the old gentleman; &lsquo;I shall ockipy
      myself in havin&rsquo; a small settlement with that &lsquo;ere Stiggins.&rsquo; Before Sam
      could interfere to prevent it, his heroic parent had penetrated into a
      remote corner of the room, and attacked the Reverend Mr. Stiggins with
      manual dexterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come off!&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come on!&rsquo; cried Mr. Weller; and without further invitation he gave the
      Reverend Mr. Stiggins a preliminary tap on the head, and began dancing
      round him in a buoyant and cork-like manner, which in a gentleman at his
      time of life was a perfect marvel to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding all remonstrances unavailing, Sam pulled his hat firmly on, threw
      his father&rsquo;s coat over his arm, and taking the old man round the waist,
      forcibly dragged him down the ladder, and into the street; never releasing
      his hold, or permitting him to stop, until they reached the corner. As
      they gained it, they could hear the shouts of the populace, who were
      witnessing the removal of the Reverend Mr. Stiggins to strong lodgings for
      the night, and could hear the noise occasioned by the dispersion in
      various directions of the members of the Brick Lane Branch of the United
      Grand Junction Ebenezer Temperance Association.

      CHAPTER XXXIV. IS WHOLLY DEVOTED TO A FULL AND FAITHFUL REPORT OF THE
      MEMORABLE TRIAL OF BARDELL AGAINST PICKWICK
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> wonder what the
      foreman of the jury, whoever he&rsquo;ll be, has got for breakfast,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Snodgrass, by way of keeping up a conversation on the eventful morning of
      the fourteenth of February.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Perker, &lsquo;I hope he&rsquo;s got a good one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Why so?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Highly important&mdash;very important, my dear Sir,&rsquo; replied Perker. &lsquo;A
      good, contented, well-breakfasted juryman is a capital thing to get hold
      of. Discontented or hungry jurymen, my dear sir, always find for the
      plaintiff.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless my heart,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking very blank, &lsquo;what do they do
      that for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; replied the little man coolly; &lsquo;saves time, I
      suppose. If it&rsquo;s near dinner-time, the foreman takes out his watch when
      the jury has retired, and says, &ldquo;Dear me, gentlemen, ten minutes to five,
      I declare! I dine at five, gentlemen.&rdquo; &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; says everybody else,
      except two men who ought to have dined at three and seem more than half
      disposed to stand out in consequence. The foreman smiles, and puts up his
      watch:&mdash;&ldquo;Well, gentlemen, what do we say, plaintiff or defendant,
      gentlemen? I rather think, so far as I am concerned, gentlemen,&mdash;I
      say, I rather think&mdash;but don&rsquo;t let that influence you&mdash;I <i>rather</i>
      think the plaintiff&rsquo;s the man.&rdquo; Upon this, two or three other men are sure
      to say that they think so too&mdash;as of course they do; and then they
      get on very unanimously and comfortably. Ten minutes past nine!&rsquo; said the
      little man, looking at his watch. &lsquo;Time we were off, my dear sir; breach
      of promise trial-court is generally full in such cases. You had better
      ring for a coach, my dear sir, or we shall be rather late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick immediately rang the bell, and a coach having been procured,
      the four Pickwickians and Mr. Perker ensconced themselves therein, and
      drove to Guildhall; Sam Weller, Mr. Lowten, and the blue bag, following in
      a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lowten,&rsquo; said Perker, when they reached the outer hall of the court, &lsquo;put
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s friends in the students&rsquo; box; Mr. Pickwick himself had
      better sit by me. This way, my dear sir, this way.&rsquo; Taking Mr. Pickwick by
      the coat sleeve, the little man led him to the low seat just beneath the
      desks of the King&rsquo;s Counsel, which is constructed for the convenience of
      attorneys, who from that spot can whisper into the ear of the leading
      counsel in the case, any instructions that may be necessary during the
      progress of the trial. The occupants of this seat are invisible to the
      great body of spectators, inasmuch as they sit on a much lower level than
      either the barristers or the audience, whose seats are raised above the
      floor. Of course they have their backs to both, and their faces towards
      the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the witness-box, I suppose?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, pointing to a kind
      of pulpit, with a brass rail, on his left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the witness-box, my dear sir,&rsquo; replied Perker, disinterring a
      quantity of papers from the blue bag, which Lowten had just deposited at
      his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, pointing to a couple of enclosed seats on
      his right, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s where the jurymen sit, is it not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The identical place, my dear Sir,&rsquo; replied Perker, tapping the lid of his
      snuff-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick stood up in a state of great agitation, and took a glance at
      the court. There were already a pretty large sprinkling of spectators in
      the gallery, and a numerous muster of gentlemen in wigs, in the
      barristers&rsquo; seats, who presented, as a body, all that pleasing and
      extensive variety of nose and whisker for which the Bar of England is so
      justly celebrated. Such of the gentlemen as had a brief to carry, carried
      it in as conspicuous a manner as possible, and occasionally scratched
      their noses therewith, to impress the fact more strongly on the
      observation of the spectators. Other gentlemen, who had no briefs to show,
      carried under their arms goodly octavos, with a red label behind, and that
      under-done-pie-crust-coloured cover, which is technically known as &lsquo;law
      calf.&rsquo; Others, who had neither briefs nor books, thrust their hands into
      their pockets, and looked as wise as they conveniently could; others,
      again, moved here and there with great restlessness and earnestness of
      manner, content to awaken thereby the admiration and astonishment of the
      uninitiated strangers. The whole, to the great wonderment of Mr. Pickwick,
      were divided into little groups, who were chatting and discussing the news
      of the day in the most unfeeling manner possible&mdash;just as if no trial
      at all were coming on.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bow from Mr. Phunky, as he entered, and took his seat behind the row
      appropriated to the King&rsquo;s Counsel, attracted Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s attention;
      and he had scarcely returned it, when Mr. Serjeant Snubbin appeared,
      followed by Mr. Mallard, who half hid the Serjeant behind a large crimson
      bag, which he placed on his table, and, after shaking hands with Perker,
      withdrew. Then there entered two or three more Serjeants; and among them,
      one with a fat body and a red face, who nodded in a friendly manner to Mr.
      Serjeant Snubbin, and said it was a fine morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that red-faced man, who said it was a fine morning, and nodded to
      our counsel?&rsquo; whispered Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz,&rsquo; replied Perker. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s opposed to us; he leads on
      the other side. That gentleman behind him is Mr. Skimpin, his junior.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was on the point of inquiring, with great abhorrence of the
      man&rsquo;s cold-blooded villainy, how Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz, who was counsel for
      the opposite party, dared to presume to tell Mr. Serjeant Snubbin, who was
      counsel for him, that it was a fine morning, when he was interrupted by a
      general rising of the barristers, and a loud cry of &lsquo;Silence!&rsquo; from the
      officers of the court. Looking round, he found that this was caused by the
      entrance of the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Justice Stareleigh (who sat in the absence of the Chief Justice,
      occasioned by indisposition) was a most particularly short man, and so
      fat, that he seemed all face and waistcoat. He rolled in, upon two little
      turned legs, and having bobbed gravely to the Bar, who bobbed gravely to
      him, put his little legs underneath his table, and his little
      three-cornered hat upon it; and when Mr. Justice Stareleigh had done this,
      all you could see of him was two queer little eyes, one broad pink face,
      and somewhere about half of a big and very comical-looking wig.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge had no sooner taken his seat, than the officer on the floor of
      the court called out &lsquo;Silence!&rsquo; in a commanding tone, upon which another
      officer in the gallery cried &lsquo;Silence!&rsquo; in an angry manner, whereupon
      three or four more ushers shouted &lsquo;Silence!&rsquo; in a voice of indignant
      remonstrance. This being done, a gentleman in black, who sat below the
      judge, proceeded to call over the names of the jury; and after a great
      deal of bawling, it was discovered that only ten special jurymen were
      present. Upon this, Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz prayed a <i>tales</i>; the
      gentleman in black then proceeded to press into the special jury, two of
      the common jurymen; and a greengrocer and a chemist were caught directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Answer to your names, gentlemen, that you may be sworn,&rsquo; said the
      gentleman in black. &lsquo;Richard Upwitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said the greengrocer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thomas Groffin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said the chemist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take the book, gentlemen. You shall well and truly try&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg this court&rsquo;s pardon,&rsquo; said the chemist, who was a tall, thin,
      yellow-visaged man, &lsquo;but I hope this court will excuse my attendance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On what grounds, Sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Justice Stareleigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no assistant, my Lord,&rsquo; said the chemist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help that, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Justice Stareleigh. &lsquo;You should hire
      one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t afford it, my Lord,&rsquo; rejoined the chemist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you ought to be able to afford it, Sir,&rsquo; said the judge, reddening;
      for Mr. Justice Stareleigh&rsquo;s temper bordered on the irritable, and brooked
      not contradiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know I <i>ought </i>to do, if I got on as well as I deserved; but I
      don&rsquo;t, my Lord,&rsquo; answered the chemist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Swear the gentleman,&rsquo; said the judge peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer had got no further than the &lsquo;You shall well and truly try,&rsquo; 
      when he was again interrupted by the chemist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am to be sworn, my Lord, am I?&rsquo; said the chemist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, sir,&rsquo; replied the testy little judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, my Lord,&rsquo; replied the chemist, in a resigned manner. &lsquo;Then
      there&rsquo;ll be murder before this trial&rsquo;s over; that&rsquo;s all. Swear me, if you
      please, Sir;&rsquo; and sworn the chemist was, before the judge could find words
      to utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I merely wanted to observe, my Lord,&rsquo; said the chemist, taking his seat
      with great deliberation, &lsquo;that I&rsquo;ve left nobody but an errand-boy in my
      shop. He is a very nice boy, my Lord, but he is not acquainted with drugs;
      and I know that the prevailing impression on his mind is, that Epsom salts
      means oxalic acid; and syrup of senna, laudanum. That&rsquo;s all, my Lord.&rsquo; 
      With this, the tall chemist composed himself into a comfortable attitude,
      and, assuming a pleasant expression of countenance, appeared to have
      prepared himself for the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was regarding the chemist with feelings of the deepest
      horror, when a slight sensation was perceptible in the body of the court;
      and immediately afterwards Mrs. Bardell, supported by Mrs. Cluppins, was
      led in, and placed, in a drooping state, at the other end of the seat on
      which Mr. Pickwick sat. An extra-sized umbrella was then handed in by Mr.
      Dodson, and a pair of pattens by Mr. Fogg, each of whom had prepared a
      most sympathising and melancholy face for the occasion. Mrs. Sanders then
      appeared, leading in Master Bardell. At sight of her child, Mrs. Bardell
      started; suddenly recollecting herself, she kissed him in a frantic
      manner; then relapsing into a state of hysterical imbecility, the good
      lady requested to be informed where she was. In reply to this, Mrs.
      Cluppins and Mrs. Sanders turned their heads away and wept, while Messrs.
      Dodson and Fogg entreated the plaintiff to compose herself. Serjeant
      Buzfuz rubbed his eyes very hard with a large white handkerchief, and gave
      an appealing look towards the jury, while the judge was visibly affected,
      and several of the beholders tried to cough down their emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good notion that indeed,&rsquo; whispered Perker to Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Capital
      fellows those Dodson and Fogg; excellent ideas of effect, my dear Sir,
      excellent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Perker spoke, Mrs. Bardell began to recover by slow degrees, while Mrs.
      Cluppins, after a careful survey of Master Bardell&rsquo;s buttons and the
      button-holes to which they severally belonged, placed him on the floor of
      the court in front of his mother&mdash;a commanding position in which he
      could not fail to awaken the full commiseration and sympathy of both judge
      and jury. This was not done without considerable opposition, and many
      tears, on the part of the young gentleman himself, who had certain inward
      misgivings that the placing him within the full glare of the judge&rsquo;s eye
      was only a formal prelude to his being immediately ordered away for
      instant execution, or for transportation beyond the seas, during the whole
      term of his natural life, at the very least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bardell and Pickwick,&rsquo; cried the gentleman in black, calling on the case,
      which stood first on the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am for the plaintiff, my Lord,&rsquo; said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is with you, Brother Buzfuz?&rsquo; said the judge. Mr. Skimpin bowed, to
      intimate that he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I appear for the defendant, my Lord,&rsquo; said Mr. Serjeant Snubbin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anybody with you, Brother Snubbin?&rsquo; inquired the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Phunky, my Lord,&rsquo; replied Serjeant Snubbin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serjeant Buzfuz and Mr. Skimpin for the plaintiff,&rsquo; said the judge,
      writing down the names in his note-book, and reading as he wrote; &lsquo;for the
      defendant, Serjeant Snubbin and Mr. Monkey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beg your Lordship&rsquo;s pardon, Phunky.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, very good,&rsquo; said the judge; &lsquo;I never had the pleasure of hearing the
      gentleman&rsquo;s name before.&rsquo; Here Mr. Phunky bowed and smiled, and the judge
      bowed and smiled too, and then Mr. Phunky, blushing into the very whites
      of his eyes, tried to look as if he didn&rsquo;t know that everybody was gazing
      at him, a thing which no man ever succeeded in doing yet, or in all
      reasonable probability, ever will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go on,&rsquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ushers again called silence, and Mr. Skimpin proceeded to &lsquo;open the
      case&rsquo;; and the case appeared to have very little inside it when he had
      opened it, for he kept such particulars as he knew, completely to himself,
      and sat down, after a lapse of three minutes, leaving the jury in
      precisely the same advanced stage of wisdom as they were in before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serjeant Buzfuz then rose with all the majesty and dignity which the grave
      nature of the proceedings demanded, and having whispered to Dodson, and
      conferred briefly with Fogg, pulled his gown over his shoulders, settled
      his wig, and addressed the jury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serjeant Buzfuz began by saying, that never, in the whole course of his
      professional experience&mdash;never, from the very first moment of his
      applying himself to the study and practice of the law&mdash;had he
      approached a case with feelings of such deep emotion, or with such a heavy
      sense of the responsibility imposed upon him&mdash;a responsibility, he
      would say, which he could never have supported, were he not buoyed up and
      sustained by a conviction so strong, that it amounted to positive
      certainty that the cause of truth and justice, or, in other words, the
      cause of his much-injured and most oppressed client, must prevail with the
      high-minded and intelligent dozen of men whom he now saw in that box
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Counsel usually begin in this way, because it puts the jury on the very
      best terms with themselves, and makes them think what sharp fellows they
      must be. A visible effect was produced immediately, several jurymen
      beginning to take voluminous notes with the utmost eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have heard from my learned friend, gentlemen,&rsquo; continued Serjeant
      Buzfuz, well knowing that, from the learned friend alluded to, the
      gentlemen of the jury had heard just nothing at all&mdash;&lsquo;you have heard
      from my learned friend, gentlemen, that this is an action for a breach of
      promise of marriage, in which the damages are laid at £1,500. But you have
      not heard from my learned friend, inasmuch as it did not come within my
      learned friend&rsquo;s province to tell you, what are the facts and
      circumstances of the case. Those facts and circumstances, gentlemen, you
      shall hear detailed by me, and proved by the unimpeachable female whom I
      will place in that box before you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz, with a tremendous emphasis on the word &lsquo;box,&rsquo; 
      smote his table with a mighty sound, and glanced at Dodson and Fogg, who
      nodded admiration of the Serjeant, and indignant defiance of the
      defendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The plaintiff, gentlemen,&rsquo; continued Serjeant Buzfuz, in a soft and
      melancholy voice, &lsquo;the plaintiff is a widow; yes, gentlemen, a widow. The
      late Mr. Bardell, after enjoying, for many years, the esteem and
      confidence of his sovereign, as one of the guardians of his royal
      revenues, glided almost imperceptibly from the world, to seek elsewhere
      for that repose and peace which a custom-house can never afford.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this pathetic description of the decease of Mr. Bardell, who had been
      knocked on the head with a quart-pot in a public-house cellar, the learned
      serjeant&rsquo;s voice faltered, and he proceeded, with emotion&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some time before his death, he had stamped his likeness upon a little
      boy. With this little boy, the only pledge of her departed exciseman, Mrs.
      Bardell shrank from the world, and courted the retirement and tranquillity
      of Goswell Street; and here she placed in her front parlour window a
      written placard, bearing this inscription&mdash;&ldquo;Apartments furnished for
      a single gentleman. Inquire within.&rdquo;&rsquo; Here Serjeant Buzfuz paused, while
      several gentlemen of the jury took a note of the document.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no date to that, is there?&rsquo; inquired a juror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no date, gentlemen,&rsquo; replied Serjeant Buzfuz; &lsquo;but I am
      instructed to say that it was put in the plaintiff&rsquo;s parlour window just
      this time three years. I entreat the attention of the jury to the wording
      of this document&mdash;&ldquo;Apartments furnished for a single gentleman&rdquo;! Mrs.
      Bardell&rsquo;s opinions of the opposite sex, gentlemen, were derived from a
      long contemplation of the inestimable qualities of her lost husband. She
      had no fear, she had no distrust, she had no suspicion; all was confidence
      and reliance. &ldquo;Mr. Bardell,&rdquo; said the widow&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Bardell was a man
      of honour, Mr. Bardell was a man of his word, Mr. Bardell was no deceiver,
      Mr. Bardell was once a single gentleman himself; to single gentlemen I
      look for protection, for assistance, for comfort, and for consolation; in
      single gentlemen I shall perpetually see something to remind me of what
      Mr. Bardell was when he first won my young and untried affections; to a
      single gentleman, then, shall my lodgings be let.&rdquo; Actuated by this
      beautiful and touching impulse (among the best impulses of our imperfect
      nature, gentlemen), the lonely and desolate widow dried her tears,
      furnished her first floor, caught her innocent boy to her maternal bosom,
      and put the bill up in her parlour window. Did it remain there long? No.
      The serpent was on the watch, the train was laid, the mine was preparing,
      the sapper and miner was at work. Before the bill had been in the parlour
      window three days&mdash;three days, gentlemen&mdash;a being, erect upon
      two legs, and bearing all the outward semblance of a man, and not of a
      monster, knocked at the door of Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s house. He inquired within&mdash;he
      took the lodgings; and on the very next day he entered into possession of
      them. This man was Pickwick&mdash;Pickwick, the defendant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serjeant Buzfuz, who had proceeded with such volubility that his face was
      perfectly crimson, here paused for breath. The silence awoke Mr. Justice
      Stareleigh, who immediately wrote down something with a pen without any
      ink in it, and looked unusually profound, to impress the jury with the
      belief that he always thought most deeply with his eyes shut. Serjeant
      Buzfuz proceeded&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of this man Pickwick I will say little; the subject presents but few
      attractions; and I, gentlemen, am not the man, nor are you, gentlemen, the
      men, to delight in the contemplation of revolting heartlessness, and of
      systematic villainy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Pickwick, who had been writhing in silence for some time, gave a
      violent start, as if some vague idea of assaulting Serjeant Buzfuz, in the
      august presence of justice and law, suggested itself to his mind. An
      admonitory gesture from Perker restrained him, and he listened to the
      learned gentleman&rsquo;s continuation with a look of indignation, which
      contrasted forcibly with the admiring faces of Mrs. Cluppins and Mrs.
      Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say systematic villainy, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, looking
      through Mr. Pickwick, and talking <i>at</i> him; &lsquo;and when I say
      systematic villainy, let me tell the defendant Pickwick, if he be in
      court, as I am informed he is, that it would have been more decent in him,
      more becoming, in better judgment, and in better taste, if he had stopped
      away. Let me tell him, gentlemen, that any gestures of dissent or
      disapprobation in which he may indulge in this court will not go down with
      you; that you will know how to value and how to appreciate them; and let
      me tell him further, as my Lord will tell you, gentlemen, that a counsel,
      in the discharge of his duty to his client, is neither to be intimidated
      nor bullied, nor put down; and that any attempt to do either the one or
      the other, or the first, or the last, will recoil on the head of the
      attempter, be he plaintiff or be he defendant, be his name Pickwick, or
      Noakes, or Stoakes, or Stiles, or Brown, or Thompson.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

      <a href="images/20101.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      This little divergence from the subject in hand, had, of course, the
      intended effect of turning all eyes to Mr. Pickwick. Serjeant Buzfuz,
      having partially recovered from the state of moral elevation into which he
      had lashed himself, resumed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall show you, gentlemen, that for two years, Pickwick continued to
      reside constantly, and without interruption or intermission, at Mrs.
      Bardell&rsquo;s house. I shall show you that Mrs. Bardell, during the whole of
      that time, waited on him, attended to his comforts, cooked his meals,
      looked out his linen for the washerwoman when it went abroad, darned,
      aired, and prepared it for wear, when it came home, and, in short, enjoyed
      his fullest trust and confidence. I shall show you that, on many
      occasions, he gave halfpence, and on some occasions even sixpences, to her
      little boy; and I shall prove to you, by a witness whose testimony it will
      be impossible for my learned friend to weaken or controvert, that on one
      occasion he patted the boy on the head, and, after inquiring whether he
      had won any &ldquo;<i>alley tors</i>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>commoneys</i>&rdquo; lately (both of
      which I understand to be a particular species of marbles much prized by
      the youth of this town), made use of this remarkable expression, &ldquo;How
      should you like to have another father?&rdquo; I shall prove to you, gentlemen,
      that about a year ago, Pickwick suddenly began to absent himself from
      home, during long intervals, as if with the intention of gradually
      breaking off from my client; but I shall show you also, that his
      resolution was not at that time sufficiently strong, or that his better
      feelings conquered, if better feelings he has, or that the charms and
      accomplishments of my client prevailed against his unmanly intentions, by
      proving to you, that on one occasion, when he returned from the country,
      he distinctly and in terms, offered her marriage: previously, however,
      taking special care that there would be no witness to their solemn
      contract; and I am in a situation to prove to you, on the testimony of
      three of his own friends&mdash;most unwilling witnesses, gentlemen&mdash;most
      unwilling witnesses&mdash;that on that morning he was discovered by them
      holding the plaintiff in his arms, and soothing her agitation by his
      caresses and endearments.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A visible impression was produced upon the auditors by this part of the
      learned Serjeant&rsquo;s address. Drawing forth two very small scraps of paper,
      he proceeded&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now, gentlemen, but one word more. Two letters have passed between
      these parties, letters which are admitted to be in the handwriting of the
      defendant, and which speak volumes, indeed. The letters, too, bespeak the
      character of the man. They are not open, fervent, eloquent epistles,
      breathing nothing but the language of affectionate attachment. They are
      covert, sly, underhanded communications, but, fortunately, far more
      conclusive than if couched in the most glowing language and the most
      poetic imagery&mdash;letters that must be viewed with a cautious and
      suspicious eye&mdash;letters that were evidently intended at the time, by
      Pickwick, to mislead and delude any third parties into whose hands they
      might fall. Let me read the first: &ldquo;Garraways, twelve o&rsquo;clock. Dear Mrs.
      B.&mdash;Chops and tomato sauce. Yours, <i>Pickwick</i>.&rdquo; Gentlemen, what
      does this mean? Chops and tomato sauce. Yours, Pickwick! Chops! Gracious
      heavens! and tomato sauce! Gentlemen, is the happiness of a sensitive and
      confiding female to be trifled away, by such shallow artifices as these?
      The next has no date whatever, which is in itself suspicious. &ldquo;Dear Mrs.
      B., I shall not be at home till to-morrow. Slow coach.&rdquo; And then follows
      this very remarkable expression. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself about the
      warming-pan.&rdquo; The warming-pan! Why, gentlemen, who <i>does </i>trouble
      himself about a warming-pan? When was the peace of mind of man or woman
      broken or disturbed by a warming-pan, which is in itself a harmless, a
      useful, and I will add, gentlemen, a comforting article of domestic
      furniture? Why is Mrs. Bardell so earnestly entreated not to agitate
      herself about this warming-pan, unless (as is no doubt the case) it is a
      mere cover for hidden fire&mdash;a mere substitute for some endearing word
      or promise, agreeably to a preconcerted system of correspondence, artfully
      contrived by Pickwick with a view to his contemplated desertion, and which
      I am not in a condition to explain? And what does this allusion to the
      slow coach mean? For aught I know, it may be a reference to Pickwick
      himself, who has most unquestionably been a criminally slow coach during
      the whole of this transaction, but whose speed will now be very
      unexpectedly accelerated, and whose wheels, gentlemen, as he will find to
      his cost, will very soon be greased by you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz paused in this place, to see whether the jury smiled
      at his joke; but as nobody took it but the greengrocer, whose
      sensitiveness on the subject was very probably occasioned by his having
      subjected a chaise-cart to the process in question on that identical
      morning, the learned Serjeant considered it advisable to undergo a slight
      relapse into the dismals before he concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But enough of this, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz, &lsquo;it is
      difficult to smile with an aching heart; it is ill jesting when our
      deepest sympathies are awakened. My client&rsquo;s hopes and prospects are
      ruined, and it is no figure of speech to say that her occupation is gone
      indeed. The bill is down&mdash;but there is no tenant. Eligible single
      gentlemen pass and repass&mdash;but there is no invitation for to inquire
      within or without. All is gloom and silence in the house; even the voice
      of the child is hushed; his infant sports are disregarded when his mother
      weeps; his &ldquo;alley tors&rdquo; and his &ldquo;commoneys&rdquo; are alike neglected; he
      forgets the long familiar cry of &ldquo;knuckle down,&rdquo; and at tip-cheese, or odd
      and even, his hand is out. But Pickwick, gentlemen, Pickwick, the ruthless
      destroyer of this domestic oasis in the desert of Goswell Street&mdash;Pickwick
      who has choked up the well, and thrown ashes on the sward&mdash;Pickwick,
      who comes before you to-day with his heartless tomato sauce and
      warming-pans&mdash;Pickwick still rears his head with unblushing
      effrontery, and gazes without a sigh on the ruin he has made. Damages,
      gentlemen&mdash;heavy damages is the only punishment with which you can
      visit him; the only recompense you can award to my client. And for those
      damages she now appeals to an enlightened, a high-minded, a right-feeling,
      a conscientious, a dispassionate, a sympathising, a contemplative jury of
      her civilised countrymen.&rsquo; With this beautiful peroration, Mr. Serjeant
      Buzfuz sat down, and Mr. Justice Stareleigh woke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Call Elizabeth Cluppins,&rsquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, rising a minute
      afterwards, with renewed vigour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nearest usher called for Elizabeth Tuppins; another one, at a little
      distance off, demanded Elizabeth Jupkins; and a third rushed in a
      breathless state into King Street, and screamed for Elizabeth Muffins till
      he was hoarse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mrs. Cluppins, with the combined assistance of Mrs. Bardell,
      Mrs. Sanders, Mr. Dodson, and Mr. Fogg, was hoisted into the witness-box;
      and when she was safely perched on the top step, Mrs. Bardell stood on the
      bottom one, with the pocket-handkerchief and pattens in one hand, and a
      glass bottle that might hold about a quarter of a pint of smelling-salts
      in the other, ready for any emergency. Mrs. Sanders, whose eyes were
      intently fixed on the judge&rsquo;s face, planted herself close by, with the
      large umbrella, keeping her right thumb pressed on the spring with an
      earnest countenance, as if she were fully prepared to put it up at a
      moment&rsquo;s notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Cluppins,&rsquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, &lsquo;pray compose yourself, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; Of
      course, directly Mrs. Cluppins was desired to compose herself, she sobbed
      with increased vehemence, and gave divers alarming manifestations of an
      approaching fainting fit, or, as she afterwards said, of her feelings
      being too many for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you recollect, Mrs. Cluppins,&rsquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, after a few
      unimportant questions&mdash;&lsquo;do you recollect being in Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s back
      one pair of stairs, on one particular morning in July last, when she was
      dusting Pickwick&rsquo;s apartment?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my Lord and jury, I do,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Cluppins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s sitting-room was the first-floor front, I believe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it were, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Cluppins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What were you doing in the back room, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; inquired the little judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My Lord and jury,&rsquo; said Mrs. Cluppins, with interesting agitation, &lsquo;I
      will not deceive you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better not, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the little judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was there,&rsquo; resumed Mrs. Cluppins, &lsquo;unbeknown to Mrs. Bardell; I had
      been out with a little basket, gentlemen, to buy three pound of red kidney
      pertaties, which was three pound tuppence ha&rsquo;penny, when I see Mrs.
      Bardell&rsquo;s street door on the jar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the what?&rsquo; exclaimed the little judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Partly open, my Lord,&rsquo; said Serjeant Snubbin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She said on the jar,&rsquo; said the little judge, with a cunning look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all the same, my Lord,&rsquo; said Serjeant Snubbin. The little judge
      looked doubtful, and said he&rsquo;d make a note of it. Mrs. Cluppins then
      resumed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I walked in, gentlemen, just to say good-mornin&rsquo;, and went, in a
      permiscuous manner, upstairs, and into the back room. Gentlemen, there was
      the sound of voices in the front room, and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you listened, I believe, Mrs. Cluppins?&rsquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beggin&rsquo; your pardon, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Cluppins, in a majestic manner,
      &lsquo;I would scorn the haction. The voices was very loud, Sir, and forced
      themselves upon my ear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Mrs. Cluppins, you were not listening, but you heard the voices.
      Was one of those voices Pickwick&rsquo;s?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it were, Sir.&rsquo; And Mrs. Cluppins, after distinctly stating that Mr.
      Pickwick addressed himself to Mrs. Bardell, repeated by slow degrees, and
      by dint of many questions, the conversation with which our readers are
      already acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jury looked suspicious, and Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz smiled as he sat down.
      They looked positively awful when Serjeant Snubbin intimated that he
      should not cross-examine the witness, for Mr. Pickwick wished it to be
      distinctly stated that it was due to her to say, that her account was in
      substance correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cluppins having once broken the ice, thought it a favourable
      opportunity for entering into a short dissertation on her own domestic
      affairs; so she straightway proceeded to inform the court that she was the
      mother of eight children at that present speaking, and that she
      entertained confident expectations of presenting Mr. Cluppins with a
      ninth, somewhere about that day six months. At this interesting point, the
      little judge interposed most irascibly; and the effect of the
      interposition was, that both the worthy lady and Mrs. Sanders were
      politely taken out of court, under the escort of Mr. Jackson, without
      further parley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nathaniel Winkle!&rsquo; said Mr. Skimpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here!&rsquo; replied a feeble voice. Mr. Winkle entered the witness-box, and
      having been duly sworn, bowed to the judge with considerable deference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me, Sir,&rsquo; said the judge sharply, in acknowledgment of the
      salute; &lsquo;look at the jury.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle obeyed the mandate, and looked at the place where he thought it
      most probable the jury might be; for seeing anything in his then state of
      intellectual complication was wholly out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle was then examined by Mr. Skimpin, who, being a promising young
      man of two or three-and-forty, was of course anxious to confuse a witness
      who was notoriously predisposed in favour of the other side, as much as he
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Skimpin, &lsquo;have the goodness to let his Lordship know
      what your name is, will you?&rsquo; and Mr. Skimpin inclined his head on one
      side to listen with great sharpness to the answer, and glanced at the jury
      meanwhile, as if to imply that he rather expected Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s natural
      taste for perjury would induce him to give some name which did not belong
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Winkle,&rsquo; replied the witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your Christian name, Sir?&rsquo; angrily inquired the little judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nathaniel, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Daniel&mdash;any other name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nathaniel, sir&mdash;my Lord, I mean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nathaniel Daniel, or Daniel Nathaniel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, my Lord, only Nathaniel&mdash;not Daniel at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you tell me it was Daniel for, then, sir?&rsquo; inquired the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t, my Lord,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You did, Sir,&rsquo; replied the judge, with a severe frown. &lsquo;How could I have
      got Daniel on my notes, unless you told me so, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This argument was, of course, unanswerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Winkle has rather a short memory, my Lord,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Skimpin,
      with another glance at the jury. &lsquo;We shall find means to refresh it before
      we have quite done with him, I dare say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better be careful, Sir,&rsquo; said the little judge, with a sinister
      look at the witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mr. Winkle bowed, and endeavoured to feign an easiness of manner,
      which, in his then state of confusion, gave him rather the air of a
      disconcerted pickpocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Mr. Winkle,&rsquo; said Mr. Skimpin, &lsquo;attend to me, if you please, Sir;
      and let me recommend you, for your own sake, to bear in mind his
      Lordship&rsquo;s injunctions to be careful. I believe you are a particular
      friend of Mr. Pickwick, the defendant, are you not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have known Mr. Pickwick now, as well as I recollect at this moment,
      nearly&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, Mr. Winkle, do not evade the question. Are you, or are you not, a
      particular friend of the defendant&rsquo;s?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was just about to say, that&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you, or will you not, answer my question, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don&rsquo;t answer the question, you&rsquo;ll be committed, Sir,&rsquo; interposed
      the little judge, looking over his note-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Skimpin, &lsquo;yes or no, if you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you are. And why couldn&rsquo;t you say that at once, Sir? Perhaps you
      know the plaintiff too? Eh, Mr. Winkle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know her; I&rsquo;ve seen her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t know her, but you&rsquo;ve seen her? Now, have the goodness to
      tell the gentlemen of the jury what you mean by that, Mr. Winkle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean that I am not intimate with her, but I have seen her when I went
      to call on Mr. Pickwick, in Goswell Street.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How often have you seen her, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How often?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Mr. Winkle, how often? I&rsquo;ll repeat the question for you a dozen
      times, if you require it, Sir.&rsquo; And the learned gentleman, with a firm and
      steady frown, placed his hands on his hips, and smiled suspiciously to the
      jury.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this question there arose the edifying brow-beating, customary on such
      points. First of all, Mr. Winkle said it was quite impossible for him to
      say how many times he had seen Mrs. Bardell. Then he was asked if he had
      seen her twenty times, to which he replied, &lsquo;Certainly&mdash;more than
      that.&rsquo; Then he was asked whether he hadn&rsquo;t seen her a hundred times&mdash;whether
      he couldn&rsquo;t swear that he had seen her more than fifty times&mdash;whether
      he didn&rsquo;t know that he had seen her at least seventy-five times, and so
      forth; the satisfactory conclusion which was arrived at, at last, being,
      that he had better take care of himself, and mind what he was about. The
      witness having been by these means reduced to the requisite ebb of nervous
      perplexity, the examination was continued as follows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, Mr. Winkle, do you remember calling on the defendant Pickwick at
      these apartments in the plaintiff&rsquo;s house in Goswell Street, on one
      particular morning, in the month of July last?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Were you accompanied on that occasion by a friend of the name of Tupman,
      and another by the name of Snodgrass?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are they here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, they are,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle, looking very earnestly towards the
      spot where his friends were stationed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray attend to me, Mr. Winkle, and never mind your friends,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Skimpin, with another expressive look at the jury. &lsquo;They must tell their
      stories without any previous consultation with you, if none has yet taken
      place (another look at the jury). Now, Sir, tell the gentlemen of the jury
      what you saw on entering the defendant&rsquo;s room, on this particular morning.
      Come; out with it, Sir; we must have it, sooner or later.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The defendant, Mr. Pickwick, was holding the plaintiff in his arms, with
      his hands clasping her waist,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle with natural hesitation,
      &lsquo;and the plaintiff appeared to have fainted away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you hear the defendant say anything?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I heard him call Mrs. Bardell a good creature, and I heard him ask her to
      compose herself, for what a situation it was, if anybody should come, or
      words to that effect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Mr. Winkle, I have only one more question to ask you, and I beg you
      to bear in mind his Lordship&rsquo;s caution. Will you undertake to swear that
      Pickwick, the defendant, did not say on the occasion in question&mdash;&ldquo;My
      dear Mrs. Bardell, you&rsquo;re a good creature; compose yourself to this
      situation, for to this situation you must come,&rdquo; or words to that effect?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t understand him so, certainly,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle,
      astounded on this ingenious dove-tailing of the few words he had heard. &lsquo;I
      was on the staircase, and couldn&rsquo;t hear distinctly; the impression on my
      mind is&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The gentlemen of the jury want none of the impressions on your mind, Mr.
      Winkle, which I fear would be of little service to honest, straightforward
      men,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Skimpin. &lsquo;You were on the staircase, and didn&rsquo;t
      distinctly hear; but you will not swear that Pickwick did not make use of
      the expressions I have quoted? Do I understand that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I will not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle; and down sat Mr. Skimpin with a
      triumphant countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s case had not gone off in so particularly happy a manner, up
      to this point, that it could very well afford to have any additional
      suspicion cast upon it. But as it could afford to be placed in a rather
      better light, if possible, Mr. Phunky rose for the purpose of getting
      something important out of Mr. Winkle in cross-examination. Whether he did
      get anything important out of him, will immediately appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe, Mr. Winkle,&rsquo; said Mr. Phunky, &lsquo;that Mr. Pickwick is not a
      young man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle; &lsquo;old enough to be my father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have told my learned friend that you have known Mr. Pickwick a long
      time. Had you ever any reason to suppose or believe that he was about to
      be married?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no; certainly not;&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle with so much eagerness, that
      Mr. Phunky ought to have got him out of the box with all possible
      dispatch. Lawyers hold that there are two kinds of particularly bad
      witnesses&mdash;a reluctant witness, and a too-willing witness; it was Mr.
      Winkle&rsquo;s fate to figure in both characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will even go further than this, Mr. Winkle,&rsquo; continued Mr. Phunky, in a
      most smooth and complacent manner. &lsquo;Did you ever see anything in Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s manner and conduct towards the opposite sex, to induce you to
      believe that he ever contemplated matrimony of late years, in any case?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no; certainly not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has his behaviour, when females have been in the case, always been that
      of a man, who, having attained a pretty advanced period of life, content
      with his own occupations and amusements, treats them only as a father
      might his daughters?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not the least doubt of it,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle, in the fulness of his
      heart. &lsquo;That is&mdash;yes&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;certainly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have never known anything in his behaviour towards Mrs. Bardell, or
      any other female, in the least degree suspicious?&rsquo; said Mr. Phunky,
      preparing to sit down; for Serjeant Snubbin was winking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;N-n-no,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle, &lsquo;except on one trifling occasion, which, I
      have no doubt, might be easily explained.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if the unfortunate Mr. Phunky had sat down when Serjeant Snubbin had
      winked at him, or if Serjeant Buzfuz had stopped this irregular
      cross-examination at the outset (which he knew better than to do;
      observing Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s anxiety, and well knowing it would, in all
      probability, lead to something serviceable to him), this unfortunate
      admission would not have been elicited. The moment the words fell from Mr.
      Winkle&rsquo;s lips, Mr. Phunky sat down, and Serjeant Snubbin rather hastily
      told him he might leave the box, which Mr. Winkle prepared to do with
      great readiness, when Serjeant Buzfuz stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay, Mr. Winkle, stay!&rsquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, &lsquo;will your Lordship have
      the goodness to ask him, what this one instance of suspicious behaviour
      towards females on the part of this gentleman, who is old enough to be his
      father, was?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You hear what the learned counsel says, Sir,&rsquo; observed the judge, turning
      to the miserable and agonised Mr. Winkle. &lsquo;Describe the occasion to which
      you refer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My Lord,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, trembling with anxiety, &lsquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather
      not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps so,&rsquo; said the little judge; &lsquo;but you must.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid the profound silence of the whole court, Mr. Winkle faltered out,
      that the trifling circumstance of suspicion was Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s being found
      in a lady&rsquo;s sleeping-apartment at midnight; which had terminated, he
      believed, in the breaking off of the projected marriage of the lady in
      question, and had led, he knew, to the whole party being forcibly carried
      before George Nupkins, Esq., magistrate and justice of the peace, for the
      borough of Ipswich!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may leave the box, Sir,&rsquo; said Serjeant Snubbin. Mr. Winkle did leave
      the box, and rushed with delirious haste to the George and Vulture, where
      he was discovered some hours after, by the waiter, groaning in a hollow
      and dismal manner, with his head buried beneath the sofa cushions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy Tupman, and Augustus Snodgrass, were severally called into the box;
      both corroborated the testimony of their unhappy friend; and each was
      driven to the verge of desperation by excessive badgering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susannah Sanders was then called, and examined by Serjeant Buzfuz, and
      cross-examined by Serjeant Snubbin. Had always said and believed that
      Pickwick would marry Mrs. Bardell; knew that Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s being engaged
      to Pickwick was the current topic of conversation in the neighbourhood,
      after the fainting in July; had been told it herself by Mrs. Mudberry
      which kept a mangle, and Mrs. Bunkin which clear-starched, but did not see
      either Mrs. Mudberry or Mrs. Bunkin in court. Had heard Pickwick ask the
      little boy how he should like to have another father. Did not know that
      Mrs. Bardell was at that time keeping company with the baker, but did know
      that the baker was then a single man and is now married. Couldn&rsquo;t swear
      that Mrs. Bardell was not very fond of the baker, but should think that
      the baker was not very fond of Mrs. Bardell, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have married
      somebody else. Thought Mrs. Bardell fainted away on the morning in July,
      because Pickwick asked her to name the day: knew that she (witness)
      fainted away stone dead when Mr. Sanders asked her to name the day, and
      believed that everybody as called herself a lady would do the same, under
      similar circumstances. Heard Pickwick ask the boy the question about the
      marbles, but upon her oath did not know the difference between an &lsquo;alley
      tor&rsquo; and a &lsquo;commoney.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By the <i>court</i>.&mdash;During the period of her keeping company with
      Mr. Sanders, had received love letters, like other ladies. In the course
      of their correspondence Mr. Sanders had often called her a &lsquo;duck,&rsquo; but
      never &lsquo;chops,&rsquo; nor yet &lsquo;tomato sauce.&rsquo; He was particularly fond of ducks.
      Perhaps if he had been as fond of chops and tomato sauce, he might have
      called her that, as a term of affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serjeant Buzfuz now rose with more importance than he had yet exhibited,
      if that were possible, and vociferated; &lsquo;Call Samuel Weller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite unnecessary to call Samuel Weller; for Samuel Weller stepped
      briskly into the box the instant his name was pronounced; and placing his
      hat on the floor, and his arms on the rail, took a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the
      Bar, and a comprehensive survey of the Bench, with a remarkably cheerful
      and lively aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your name, sir?&rsquo; inquired the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam Weller, my Lord,&rsquo; replied that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you spell it with a &ldquo;V&rdquo; or a &ldquo;W&rdquo;?&rsquo; inquired the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That depends upon the taste and fancy of the speller, my Lord,&rsquo; replied
      Sam; &lsquo;I never had occasion to spell it more than once or twice in my life,
      but I spells it with a &ldquo;V.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a voice in the gallery exclaimed aloud, &lsquo;Quite right too, Samivel,
      quite right. Put it down a &ldquo;we,&rdquo; my Lord, put it down a &ldquo;we.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Who is that, who dares address the court?&rsquo; said the little judge, looking
      up. &lsquo;Usher.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my Lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bring that person here instantly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my Lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the usher didn&rsquo;t find the person, he didn&rsquo;t bring him; and, after a
      great commotion, all the people who had got up to look for the culprit,
      sat down again. The little judge turned to the witness as soon as his
      indignation would allow him to speak, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know who that was, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I rayther suspect it was my father, my lord,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you see him here now?&rsquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, my Lord,&rsquo; replied Sam, staring right up into the lantern at
      the roof of the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you could have pointed him out, I would have committed him instantly,&rsquo; 
      said the judge. Sam bowed his acknowledgments and turned, with unimpaired
      cheerfulness of countenance, towards Serjeant Buzfuz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, sir,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe you are in the service of Mr. Pickwick, the defendant in this
      case? Speak up, if you please, Mr. Weller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean to speak up, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam; &lsquo;I am in the service o&rsquo; that &lsquo;ere
      gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;man, and a wery good service it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Little to do, and plenty to get, I suppose?&rsquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, with
      jocularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, quite enough to get, Sir, as the soldier said ven they ordered him
      three hundred and fifty lashes,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must not tell us what the soldier, or any other man, said, Sir,&rsquo; 
      interposed the judge; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s not evidence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good, my Lord,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you recollect anything particular happening on the morning when you
      were first engaged by the defendant; eh, Mr. Weller?&rsquo; said Serjeant
      Buzfuz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I do, sir,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have the goodness to tell the jury what it was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had a reg&rsquo;lar new fit out o&rsquo; clothes that mornin&rsquo;, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men of the
      jury,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;and that was a wery partickler and uncommon circumstance
      vith me in those days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon there was a general laugh; and the little judge, looking with an
      angry countenance over his desk, said, &lsquo;You had better be careful, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So Mr. Pickwick said at the time, my Lord,&rsquo; replied Sam; &lsquo;and I was wery
      careful o&rsquo; that &lsquo;ere suit o&rsquo; clothes; wery careful indeed, my Lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge looked sternly at Sam for full two minutes, but Sam&rsquo;s features
      were so perfectly calm and serene that the judge said nothing, and
      motioned Serjeant Buzfuz to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean to tell me, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, folding his
      arms emphatically, and turning half-round to the jury, as if in mute
      assurance that he would bother the witness yet&mdash;&lsquo;do you mean to tell
      me, Mr. Weller, that you saw nothing of this fainting on the part of the
      plaintiff in the arms of the defendant, which you have heard described by
      the witnesses?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly not,&rsquo; replied Sam; &lsquo;I was in the passage till they called me up,
      and then the old lady was not there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, attend, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, dipping a large pen into
      the inkstand before him, for the purpose of frightening Sam with a show of
      taking down his answer. &lsquo;You were in the passage, and yet saw nothing of
      what was going forward. Have you a pair of eyes, Mr. Weller?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I have a pair of eyes,&rsquo; replied Sam, &lsquo;and that&rsquo;s just it. If they
      wos a pair o&rsquo; patent double million magnifyin&rsquo; gas microscopes of hextra
      power, p&rsquo;raps I might be able to see through a flight o&rsquo; stairs and a deal
      door; but bein&rsquo; only eyes, you see, my wision &lsquo;s limited.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this answer, which was delivered without the slightest appearance of
      irritation, and with the most complete simplicity and equanimity of
      manner, the spectators tittered, the little judge smiled, and Serjeant
      Buzfuz looked particularly foolish. After a short consultation with Dodson
      &amp; Fogg, the learned Serjeant again turned towards Sam, and said, with
      a painful effort to conceal his vexation, &lsquo;Now, Mr. Weller, I&rsquo;ll ask you a
      question on another point, if you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you please, Sir,&rsquo; rejoined Sam, with the utmost good-humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you remember going up to Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s house, one night in November
      last?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes, wery well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you do remember that, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, recovering
      his spirits; &lsquo;I thought we should get at something at last.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I rayther thought that, too, sir,&rsquo; replied Sam; and at this the
      spectators tittered again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well; I suppose you went up to have a little talk about this trial&mdash;eh,
      Mr. Weller?&rsquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, looking knowingly at the jury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I went up to pay the rent; but we did get a-talkin&rsquo; about the trial,&rsquo; 
      replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you did get a-talking about the trial,&rsquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz,
      brightening up with the anticipation of some important discovery. &lsquo;Now,
      what passed about the trial; will you have the goodness to tell us, Mr.
      Weller&rsquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vith all the pleasure in life, sir,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;Arter a few
      unimportant obserwations from the two wirtuous females as has been
      examined here to-day, the ladies gets into a very great state o&rsquo; 
      admiration at the honourable conduct of Mr. Dodson and Fogg&mdash;them two
      gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men as is settin&rsquo; near you now.&rsquo; This, of course, drew general
      attention to Dodson &amp; Fogg, who looked as virtuous as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The attorneys for the plaintiff,&rsquo; said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz. &lsquo;Well! They
      spoke in high praise of the honourable conduct of Messrs. Dodson and Fogg,
      the attorneys for the plaintiff, did they?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;they said what a wery gen&rsquo;rous thing it was o&rsquo; them to
      have taken up the case on spec, and to charge nothing at all for costs,
      unless they got &lsquo;em out of Mr. Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this very unexpected reply, the spectators tittered again, and Dodson
      &amp; Fogg, turning very red, leaned over to Serjeant Buzfuz, and in a
      hurried manner whispered something in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are quite right,&rsquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz aloud, with affected
      composure. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly useless, my Lord, attempting to get at any
      evidence through the impenetrable stupidity of this witness. I will not
      trouble the court by asking him any more questions. Stand down, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would any other gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;man like to ask me anythin&rsquo;?&rsquo; inquired Sam, taking
      up his hat, and looking round most deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I, Mr. Weller, thank you,&rsquo; said Serjeant Snubbin, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may go down, sir,&rsquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, waving his hand impatiently.
      Sam went down accordingly, after doing Messrs. Dodson &amp; Fogg&rsquo;s case as
      much harm as he conveniently could, and saying just as little respecting
      Mr. Pickwick as might be, which was precisely the object he had had in
      view all along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no objection to admit, my Lord,&rsquo; said Serjeant Snubbin, &lsquo;if it
      will save the examination of another witness, that Mr. Pickwick has
      retired from business, and is a gentleman of considerable independent
      property.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, putting in the two letters to be read,
      &lsquo;then that&rsquo;s my case, my Lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serjeant Snubbin then addressed the jury on behalf of the defendant; and a
      very long and a very emphatic address he delivered, in which he bestowed
      the highest possible eulogiums on the conduct and character of Mr.
      Pickwick; but inasmuch as our readers are far better able to form a
      correct estimate of that gentleman&rsquo;s merits and deserts, than Serjeant
      Snubbin could possibly be, we do not feel called upon to enter at any
      length into the learned gentleman&rsquo;s observations. He attempted to show
      that the letters which had been exhibited, merely related to Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s dinner, or to the preparations for receiving him in his
      apartments on his return from some country excursion. It is sufficient to
      add in general terms, that he did the best he could for Mr. Pickwick; and
      the best, as everybody knows, on the infallible authority of the old
      adage, could do no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Justice Stareleigh summed up, in the old-established and most approved
      form. He read as much of his notes to the jury as he could decipher on so
      short a notice, and made running-comments on the evidence as he went
      along. If Mrs. Bardell were right, it was perfectly clear that Mr.
      Pickwick was wrong, and if they thought the evidence of Mrs. Cluppins
      worthy of credence they would believe it, and, if they didn&rsquo;t, why, they
      wouldn&rsquo;t. If they were satisfied that a breach of promise of marriage had
      been committed they would find for the plaintiff with such damages as they
      thought proper; and if, on the other hand, it appeared to them that no
      promise of marriage had ever been given, they would find for the defendant
      with no damages at all. The jury then retired to their private room to
      talk the matter over, and the judge retired to <i>his </i>private room, to
      refresh himself with a mutton chop and a glass of sherry.
    </p>
    <p>
      An anxious quarter of a hour elapsed; the jury came back; the judge was
      fetched in. Mr. Pickwick put on his spectacles, and gazed at the foreman
      with an agitated countenance and a quickly-beating heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; said the individual in black, &lsquo;are you all agreed upon your
      verdict?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are,&rsquo; replied the foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you find for the plaintiff, gentlemen, or for the defendant?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For the plaintiff.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With what damages, gentlemen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seven hundred and fifty pounds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick took off his spectacles, carefully wiped the glasses, folded
      them into their case, and put them in his pocket; then, having drawn on
      his gloves with great nicety, and stared at the foreman all the while, he
      mechanically followed Mr. Perker and the blue bag out of court.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stopped in a side room while Perker paid the court fees; and here,
      Mr. Pickwick was joined by his friends. Here, too, he encountered Messrs.
      Dodson &amp; Fogg, rubbing their hands with every token of outward
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Sir,&rsquo; said Dodson, for self and partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You imagine you&rsquo;ll get your costs, don&rsquo;t you, gentlemen?&rsquo; said Mr.
      Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fogg said they thought it rather probable. Dodson smiled, and said they&rsquo;d
      try.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may try, and try, and try again, Messrs. Dodson and Fogg,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Pickwick vehemently, &lsquo;but not one farthing of costs or damages do you ever
      get from me, if I spend the rest of my existence in a debtor&rsquo;s prison.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! ha!&rsquo; laughed Dodson. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll think better of that, before next term,
      Mr. Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He, he, he! We&rsquo;ll soon see about that, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; grinned Fogg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speechless with indignation, Mr. Pickwick allowed himself to be led by his
      solicitor and friends to the door, and there assisted into a
      hackney-coach, which had been fetched for the purpose, by the
      ever-watchful Sam Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam had put up the steps, and was preparing to jump upon the box, when he
      felt himself gently touched on the shoulder; and, looking round, his
      father stood before him. The old gentleman&rsquo;s countenance wore a mournful
      expression, as he shook his head gravely, and said, in warning accents&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know&rsquo;d what &lsquo;ud come o&rsquo; this here mode o&rsquo; doin&rsquo; bisness. Oh, Sammy,
      Sammy, vy worn&rsquo;t there a alleybi!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER XXXV. IN WHICH MR. PICKWICK THINKS HE HAD BETTER GO TO BATH; AND
      GOES ACCORDINGLY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ut surely, my dear
      sir,&rsquo; said little Perker, as he stood in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s apartment on the
      morning after the trial, &lsquo;surely you don&rsquo;t really mean&mdash;really and
      seriously now, and irritation apart&mdash;that you won&rsquo;t pay these costs
      and damages?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not one halfpenny,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick firmly; &lsquo;not one halfpenny.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hooroar for the principle, as the money-lender said ven he vouldn&rsquo;t renew
      the bill,&rsquo; observed Mr. Weller, who was clearing away the
      breakfast-things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;have the goodness to step downstairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cert&rsquo;nly, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; and acting on Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s gentle
      hint, Sam retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Perker,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with great seriousness of manner, &lsquo;my
      friends here have endeavoured to dissuade me from this determination, but
      without avail. I shall employ myself as usual, until the opposite party
      have the power of issuing a legal process of execution against me; and if
      they are vile enough to avail themselves of it, and to arrest my person, I
      shall yield myself up with perfect cheerfulness and content of heart. When
      can they do this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They can issue execution, my dear Sir, for the amount of the damages and
      taxed costs, next term,&rsquo; replied Perker, &lsquo;just two months hence, my dear
      sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Until that time, my dear fellow, let me
      hear no more of the matter. And now,&rsquo; continued Mr. Pickwick, looking
      round on his friends with a good-humoured smile, and a sparkle in the eye
      which no spectacles could dim or conceal, &lsquo;the only question is, Where
      shall we go next?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass were too much affected by their friend&rsquo;s
      heroism to offer any reply. Mr. Winkle had not yet sufficiently recovered
      the recollection of his evidence at the trial, to make any observation on
      any subject, so Mr. Pickwick paused in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said that gentleman, &lsquo;if you leave me to suggest our destination,
      I say Bath. I think none of us have ever been there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody had; and as the proposition was warmly seconded by Perker, who
      considered it extremely probable that if Mr. Pickwick saw a little change
      and gaiety he would be inclined to think better of his determination, and
      worse of a debtor&rsquo;s prison, it was carried unanimously; and Sam was at
      once despatched to the White Horse Cellar, to take five places by the
      half-past seven o&rsquo;clock coach, next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were just two places to be had inside, and just three to be had out;
      so Sam Weller booked for them all, and having exchanged a few compliments
      with the booking-office clerk on the subject of a pewter half-crown which
      was tendered him as a portion of his &lsquo;change,&rsquo; walked back to the George
      and Vulture, where he was pretty busily employed until bed-time in
      reducing clothes and linen into the smallest possible compass, and
      exerting his mechanical genius in constructing a variety of ingenious
      devices for keeping the lids on boxes which had neither locks nor hinges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next was a very unpropitious morning for a journey&mdash;muggy, damp,
      and drizzly. The horses in the stages that were going out, and had come
      through the city, were smoking so, that the outside passengers were
      invisible. The newspaper-sellers looked moist, and smelled mouldy; the wet
      ran off the hats of the orange-vendors as they thrust their heads into the
      coach windows, and diluted the insides in a refreshing manner. The Jews
      with the fifty-bladed penknives shut them up in despair; the men with the
      pocket-books made pocket-books of them. Watch-guards and toasting-forks
      were alike at a discount, and pencil-cases and sponges were a drug in the
      market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Sam Weller to rescue the luggage from the seven or eight porters
      who flung themselves savagely upon it, the moment the coach stopped, and
      finding that they were about twenty minutes too early, Mr. Pickwick and
      his friends went for shelter into the travellers&rsquo; room&mdash;the last
      resource of human dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The travellers&rsquo; room at the White Horse Cellar is of course uncomfortable;
      it would be no travellers&rsquo; room if it were not. It is the right-hand
      parlour, into which an aspiring kitchen fireplace appears to have walked,
      accompanied by a rebellious poker, tongs, and shovel. It is divided into
      boxes, for the solitary confinement of travellers, and is furnished with a
      clock, a looking-glass, and a live waiter, which latter article is kept in
      a small kennel for washing glasses, in a corner of the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these boxes was occupied, on this particular occasion, by a
      stern-eyed man of about five-and-forty, who had a bald and glossy
      forehead, with a good deal of black hair at the sides and back of his
      head, and large black whiskers. He was buttoned up to the chin in a brown
      coat; and had a large sealskin travelling-cap, and a greatcoat and cloak,
      lying on the seat beside him. He looked up from his breakfast as Mr.
      Pickwick entered, with a fierce and peremptory air, which was very
      dignified; and, having scrutinised that gentleman and his companions to
      his entire satisfaction, hummed a tune, in a manner which seemed to say
      that he rather suspected somebody wanted to take advantage of him, but it
      wouldn&rsquo;t do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Waiter,&rsquo; said the gentleman with the whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir?&rsquo; replied a man with a dirty complexion, and a towel of the same,
      emerging from the kennel before mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some more toast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Buttered toast, mind,&rsquo; said the gentleman fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Directly, sir,&rsquo; replied the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman with the whiskers hummed a tune in the same manner as
      before, and pending the arrival of the toast, advanced to the front of the
      fire, and, taking his coat tails under his arms, looked at his boots and
      ruminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder whereabouts in Bath this coach puts up,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
      mildly addressing Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hum&mdash;eh&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; said the strange man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I made an observation to my friend, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, always
      ready to enter into conversation. &lsquo;I wondered at what house the Bath coach
      put up. Perhaps you can inform me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you going to Bath?&rsquo; said the strange man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And those other gentlemen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are going also,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not inside&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be damned if you&rsquo;re going inside,&rsquo; said the strange
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not all of us,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not all of you,&rsquo; said the strange man emphatically. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve taken two
      places. If they try to squeeze six people into an infernal box that only
      holds four, I&rsquo;ll take a post-chaise and bring an action. I&rsquo;ve paid my
      fare. It won&rsquo;t do; I told the clerk when I took my places that it wouldn&rsquo;t
      do. I know these things have been done. I know they are done every day;
      but I never was done, and I never will be. Those who know me best, best
      know it; crush me!&rsquo; Here the fierce gentleman rang the bell with great
      violence, and told the waiter he&rsquo;d better bring the toast in five seconds,
      or he&rsquo;d know the reason why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;you will allow me to observe that this
      is a very unnecessary display of excitement. I have only taken places
      inside for two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad to hear it,&rsquo; said the fierce man. &lsquo;I withdraw my expressions. I
      tender an apology. There&rsquo;s my card. Give me your acquaintance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With great pleasure, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;We are to be
      fellow-travellers, and I hope we shall find each other&rsquo;s society mutually
      agreeable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope we shall,&rsquo; said the fierce gentleman. &lsquo;I know we shall. I like
      your looks; they please me. Gentlemen, your hands and names. Know me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, an interchange of friendly salutations followed this gracious
      speech; and the fierce gentleman immediately proceeded to inform the
      friends, in the same short, abrupt, jerking sentences, that his name was
      Dowler; that he was going to Bath on pleasure; that he was formerly in the
      army; that he had now set up in business as a gentleman; that he lived
      upon the profits; and that the individual for whom the second place was
      taken, was a personage no less illustrious than Mrs. Dowler, his lady
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a fine woman,&rsquo; said Mr. Dowler. &lsquo;I am proud of her. I have reason.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope I shall have the pleasure of judging,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall,&rsquo; replied Dowler. &lsquo;She shall know you. She shall esteem you. I
      courted her under singular circumstances. I won her through a rash vow.
      Thus. I saw her; I loved her; I proposed; she refused me.&mdash;&ldquo;You love
      another?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Spare my blushes.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I know him.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You do.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Very
      good; if he remains here, I&rsquo;ll skin him.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord bless me!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you skin the gentleman, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Winkle, with a very pale
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wrote him a note, I said it was a painful thing. And so it was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I said I had pledged my word as a gentleman to skin him. My character was
      at stake. I had no alternative. As an officer in His Majesty&rsquo;s service, I
      was bound to skin him. I regretted the necessity, but it must be done. He
      was open to conviction. He saw that the rules of the service were
      imperative. He fled. I married her. Here&rsquo;s the coach. That&rsquo;s her head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Dowler concluded, he pointed to a stage which had just driven up,
      from the open window of which a rather pretty face in a bright blue bonnet
      was looking among the crowd on the pavement, most probably for the rash
      man himself. Mr. Dowler paid his bill, and hurried out with his travelling
      cap, coat, and cloak; and Mr. Pickwick and his friends followed to secure
      their places.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass had seated themselves at the back part of the
      coach; Mr. Winkle had got inside; and Mr. Pickwick was preparing to follow
      him, when Sam Weller came up to his master, and whispering in his ear,
      begged to speak to him, with an air of the deepest mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the matter now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s rayther a rum go, sir,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This here, Sir,&rsquo; rejoined Sam. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m wery much afeerd, sir, that the
      properiator o&rsquo; this here coach is a playin&rsquo; some imperence vith us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is that, Sam?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;aren&rsquo;t the names down on the
      way-bill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The names is not only down on the vay-bill, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam, &lsquo;but
      they&rsquo;ve painted vun on &lsquo;em up, on the door o&rsquo; the coach.&rsquo; As Sam spoke, he
      pointed to that part of the coach door on which the proprietor&rsquo;s name
      usually appears; and there, sure enough, in gilt letters of a goodly size,
      was the magic name of <i>Pickwick</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, quite staggered by the coincidence;
      &lsquo;what a very extraordinary thing!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but that ain&rsquo;t all,&rsquo; said Sam, again directing his master&rsquo;s
      attention to the coach door; &lsquo;not content vith writin&rsquo; up &ldquo;Pick-wick,&rdquo;
       they puts &ldquo;Moses&rdquo; afore it, vich I call addin&rsquo; insult to injury, as the
      parrot said ven they not only took him from his native land, but made him
      talk the English langwidge arterwards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s odd enough, certainly, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;but if we stand
      talking here, we shall lose our places.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot, ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to be done in consequence, sir?&rsquo; exclaimed Sam,
      perfectly aghast at the coolness with which Mr. Pickwick prepared to
      ensconce himself inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Done!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;What should be done?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ain&rsquo;t nobody to be whopped for takin&rsquo; this here liberty, sir?&rsquo; said Mr.
      Weller, who had expected that at least he would have been commissioned to
      challenge the guard and the coachman to a pugilistic encounter on the
      spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick eagerly; &lsquo;not on any account. Jump
      up to your seat directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am wery much afeered,&rsquo; muttered Sam to himself, as he turned away,
      &lsquo;that somethin&rsquo; queer&rsquo;s come over the governor, or he&rsquo;d never ha&rsquo; stood
      this so quiet. I hope that &lsquo;ere trial hasn&rsquo;t broke his spirit, but it
      looks bad, wery bad.&rsquo; Mr. Weller shook his head gravely; and it is worthy
      of remark, as an illustration of the manner in which he took this
      circumstance to heart, that he did not speak another word until the coach
      reached the Kensington turnpike. Which was so long a time for him to
      remain taciturn, that the fact may be considered wholly unprecedented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing worthy of special mention occurred during the journey. Mr. Dowler
      related a variety of anecdotes, all illustrative of his own personal
      prowess and desperation, and appealed to Mrs. Dowler in corroboration
      thereof; when Mrs. Dowler invariably brought in, in the form of an
      appendix, some remarkable fact or circumstance which Mr. Dowler had
      forgotten, or had perhaps through modesty, omitted; for the addenda in
      every instance went to show that Mr. Dowler was even a more wonderful
      fellow than he made himself out to be. Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Winkle
      listened with great admiration, and at intervals conversed with Mrs.
      Dowler, who was a very agreeable and fascinating person. So, what between
      Mr. Dowler&rsquo;s stories, and Mrs. Dowler&rsquo;s charms, and Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      good-humour, and Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s good listening, the insides contrived to be
      very companionable all the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outsides did as outsides always do. They were very cheerful and
      talkative at the beginning of every stage, and very dismal and sleepy in
      the middle, and very bright and wakeful again towards the end. There was
      one young gentleman in an India-rubber cloak, who smoked cigars all day;
      and there was another young gentleman in a parody upon a greatcoat, who
      lighted a good many, and feeling obviously unsettled after the second
      whiff, threw them away when he thought nobody was looking at him. There
      was a third young man on the box who wished to be learned in cattle; and
      an old one behind, who was familiar with farming. There was a constant
      succession of Christian names in smock-frocks and white coats, who were
      invited to have a &lsquo;lift&rsquo; by the guard, and who knew every horse and
      hostler on the road and off it; and there was a dinner which would have
      been cheap at half-a-crown a mouth, if any moderate number of mouths could
      have eaten it in the time. And at seven o&rsquo;clock P.M. Mr. Pickwick and his
      friends, and Mr. Dowler and his wife, respectively retired to their
      private sitting-rooms at the White Hart Hotel, opposite the Great Pump
      Room, Bath, where the waiters, from their costume, might be mistaken for
      Westminster boys, only they destroy the illusion by behaving themselves
      much better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast had scarcely been cleared away on the succeeding morning, when a
      waiter brought in Mr. Dowler&rsquo;s card, with a request to be allowed
      permission to introduce a friend. Mr. Dowler at once followed up the
      delivery of the card, by bringing himself and the friend also.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friend was a charming young man of not much more than fifty, dressed
      in a very bright blue coat with resplendent buttons, black trousers, and
      the thinnest possible pair of highly-polished boots. A gold eye-glass was
      suspended from his neck by a short, broad, black ribbon; a gold snuff-box
      was lightly clasped in his left hand; gold rings innumerable glittered on
      his fingers; and a large diamond pin set in gold glistened in his shirt
      frill. He had a gold watch, and a gold curb chain with large gold seals;
      and he carried a pliant ebony cane with a gold top. His linen was of the
      very whitest, finest, and stiffest; his wig of the glossiest, blackest,
      and curliest. His snuff was princes&rsquo; mixture; his scent <i>bouquet du roi</i>.
      His features were contracted into a perpetual smile; and his teeth were in
      such perfect order that it was difficult at a small distance to tell the
      real from the false.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Mr. Dowler; &lsquo;my friend, Angelo Cyrus Bantam, Esquire,
      M.C.; Bantam; Mr. Pickwick. Know each other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Welcome to Ba&mdash;ath, Sir. This is indeed an acquisition. Most welcome
      to Ba&mdash;ath, sir. It is long&mdash;very long, Mr. Pickwick, since you
      drank the waters. It appears an age, Mr. Pickwick. Re-markable!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the expressions with which Angelo Cyrus Bantam, Esquire, M.C.,
      took Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s hand; retaining it in his, meantime, and shrugging up
      his shoulders with a constant succession of bows, as if he really could
      not make up his mind to the trial of letting it go again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a very long time since I drank the waters, certainly,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Pickwick; &lsquo;for, to the best of my knowledge, I was never here before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never in Ba&mdash;ath, Mr. Pickwick!&rsquo; exclaimed the Grand Master, letting
      the hand fall in astonishment. &lsquo;Never in Ba&mdash;ath! He! he! Mr.
      Pickwick, you are a wag. Not bad, not bad. Good, good. He! he! he!
      Re-markable!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To my shame, I must say that I am perfectly serious,&rsquo; rejoined Mr.
      Pickwick. &lsquo;I really never was here before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I see,&rsquo; exclaimed the Grand Master, looking extremely pleased; &lsquo;yes,
      yes&mdash;good, good&mdash;better and better. You are the gentleman of
      whom we have heard. Yes; we know you, Mr. Pickwick; we know you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The reports of the trial in those confounded papers,&rsquo; thought Mr.
      Pickwick. &lsquo;They have heard all about me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      You are the gentleman residing on Clapham Green,&rsquo; resumed Bantam, &lsquo;who
      lost the use of his limbs from imprudently taking cold after port wine;
      who could not be moved in consequence of acute suffering, and who had the
      water from the king&rsquo;s bath bottled at one hundred and three degrees, and
      sent by wagon to his bedroom in town, where he bathed, sneezed, and the
      same day recovered. Very remarkable!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick acknowledged the compliment which the supposition implied,
      but had the self-denial to repudiate it, notwithstanding; and taking
      advantage of a moment&rsquo;s silence on the part of the M.C., begged to
      introduce his friends, Mr. Tupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass. An
      introduction which overwhelmed the M.C. with delight and honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bantam,&rsquo; said Mr. Dowler, &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick and his friends are strangers.
      They must put their names down. Where&rsquo;s the book?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The register of the distinguished visitors in Ba&mdash;ath will be at the
      Pump Room this morning at two o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; replied the M.C. &lsquo;Will you guide
      our friends to that splendid building, and enable me to procure their
      autographs?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; rejoined Dowler. &lsquo;This is a long call. It&rsquo;s time to go. I shall
      be here again in an hour. Come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is a ball-night,&rsquo; said the M.C., again taking Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s hand,
      as he rose to go. &lsquo;The ball-nights in Ba&mdash;ath are moments snatched
      from paradise; rendered bewitching by music, beauty, elegance, fashion,
      etiquette, and&mdash;and&mdash;above all, by the absence of tradespeople,
      who are quite inconsistent with paradise, and who have an amalgamation of
      themselves at the Guildhall every fortnight, which is, to say the least,
      remarkable. Good-bye, good-bye!&rsquo; and protesting all the way downstairs
      that he was most satisfied, and most delighted, and most overpowered, and
      most flattered, Angelo Cyrus Bantam, Esquire, M.C., stepped into a very
      elegant chariot that waited at the door, and rattled off.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the appointed hour, Mr. Pickwick and his friends, escorted by Dowler,
      repaired to the Assembly Rooms, and wrote their names down in the book&mdash;an
      instance of condescension at which Angelo Bantam was even more overpowered
      than before. Tickets of admission to that evening&rsquo;s assembly were to have
      been prepared for the whole party, but as they were not ready, Mr.
      Pickwick undertook, despite all the protestations to the contrary of
      Angelo Bantam, to send Sam for them at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, to
      the M.C.&lsquo;s house in Queen Square. Having taken a short walk through the
      city, and arrived at the unanimous conclusion that Park Street was very
      much like the perpendicular streets a man sees in a dream, which he cannot
      get up for the life of him, they returned to the White Hart, and
      despatched Sam on the errand to which his master had pledged him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam Weller put on his hat in a very easy and graceful manner, and,
      thrusting his hands in his waistcoat pockets, walked with great
      deliberation to Queen Square, whistling as he went along, several of the
      most popular airs of the day, as arranged with entirely new movements for
      that noble instrument the organ, either mouth or barrel. Arriving at the
      number in Queen Square to which he had been directed, he left off
      whistling and gave a cheerful knock, which was instantaneously answered by
      a powdered-headed footman in gorgeous livery, and of symmetrical stature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this here Mr. Bantam&rsquo;s, old feller?&rsquo; inquired Sam Weller, nothing
      abashed by the blaze of splendour which burst upon his sight in the person
      of the powdered-headed footman with the gorgeous livery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, young man?&rsquo; was the haughty inquiry of the powdered-headed footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Cos if it is, jist you step in to him with that &lsquo;ere card, and say Mr.
      Veller&rsquo;s a-waitin&rsquo;, will you?&rsquo; said Sam. And saying it, he very coolly
      walked into the hall, and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The powdered-headed footman slammed the door very hard, and scowled very
      grandly; but both the slam and the scowl were lost upon Sam, who was
      regarding a mahogany umbrella-stand with every outward token of critical
      approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently his master&rsquo;s reception of the card had impressed the
      powdered-headed footman in Sam&rsquo;s favour, for when he came back from
      delivering it, he smiled in a friendly manner, and said that the answer
      would be ready directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;Tell the old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n not to put himself in a
      perspiration. No hurry, six-foot. I&rsquo;ve had my dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You dine early, sir,&rsquo; said the powdered-headed footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I find I gets on better at supper when I does,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you been long in Bath, sir?&rsquo; inquired the powdered-headed footman.
      &lsquo;I have not had the pleasure of hearing of you before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t created any wery surprisin&rsquo; sensation here, as yet,&rsquo; rejoined
      Sam, &lsquo;for me and the other fash&rsquo;nables only come last night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nice place, Sir,&rsquo; said the powdered-headed footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seems so,&rsquo; observed Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pleasant society, sir,&rsquo; remarked the powdered-headed footman. &lsquo;Very
      agreeable servants, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think they wos,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;Affable, unaffected,
      say-nothin&rsquo;-to-nobody sorts o&rsquo; fellers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, very much so, indeed, sir,&rsquo; said the powdered-headed footman, taking
      Sam&rsquo;s remarks as a high compliment. &lsquo;Very much so indeed. Do you do
      anything in this way, Sir?&rsquo; inquired the tall footman, producing a small
      snuff-box with a fox&rsquo;s head on the top of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not without sneezing,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it <i>is</i> difficult, sir, I confess,&rsquo; said the tall footman. &lsquo;It
      may be done by degrees, Sir. Coffee is the best practice. I carried
      coffee, Sir, for a long time. It looks very like rappee, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, a sharp peal at the bell reduced the powdered-headed footman to the
      ignominious necessity of putting the fox&rsquo;s head in his pocket, and
      hastening with a humble countenance to Mr. Bantam&rsquo;s &lsquo;study.&rsquo; By the bye,
      who ever knew a man who never read or wrote either, who hadn&rsquo;t got some
      small back parlour which he <i>would </i>call a study!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is the answer, sir,&rsquo; said the powdered-headed footman. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
      you&rsquo;ll find it inconveniently large.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it,&rsquo; said Sam, taking a letter with a small enclosure.
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s just possible as exhausted natur&rsquo; may manage to surwive it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope we shall meet again, Sir,&rsquo; said the powdered-headed footman,
      rubbing his hands, and following Sam out to the door-step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are wery obligin&rsquo;, sir,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;Now, don&rsquo;t allow yourself to
      be fatigued beyond your powers; there&rsquo;s a amiable bein&rsquo;. Consider what you
      owe to society, and don&rsquo;t let yourself be injured by too much work. For
      the sake o&rsquo; your feller-creeturs, keep yourself as quiet as you can; only
      think what a loss you would be!&rsquo; With these pathetic words, Sam Weller
      departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A very singular young man that,&rsquo; said the powdered-headed footman,
      looking after Mr. Weller, with a countenance which clearly showed he could
      make nothing of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam said nothing at all. He winked, shook his head, smiled, winked again;
      and, with an expression of countenance which seemed to denote that he was
      greatly amused with something or other, walked merrily away.
    </p>
    <p>
      At precisely twenty minutes before eight o&rsquo;clock that night, Angelo Cyrus
      Bantam, Esq., the Master of the Ceremonies, emerged from his chariot at
      the door of the Assembly Rooms in the same wig, the same teeth, the same
      eye-glass, the same watch and seals, the same rings, the same shirt-pin,
      and the same cane. The only observable alterations in his appearance were,
      that he wore a brighter blue coat, with a white silk lining, black tights,
      black silk stockings, and pumps, and a white waistcoat, and was, if
      possible, just a thought more scented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus attired, the Master of the Ceremonies, in strict discharge of the
      important duties of his all-important office, planted himself in the room
      to receive the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bath being full, the company, and the sixpences for tea, poured in, in
      shoals. In the ballroom, the long card-room, the octagonal card-room, the
      staircases, and the passages, the hum of many voices, and the sound of
      many feet, were perfectly bewildering. Dresses rustled, feathers waved,
      lights shone, and jewels sparkled. There was the music&mdash;not of the
      quadrille band, for it had not yet commenced; but the music of soft, tiny
      footsteps, with now and then a clear, merry laugh&mdash;low and gentle,
      but very pleasant to hear in a female voice, whether in Bath or elsewhere.
      Brilliant eyes, lighted up with pleasurable expectation, gleamed from
      every side; and, look where you would, some exquisite form glided
      gracefully through the throng, and was no sooner lost, than it was
      replaced by another as dainty and bewitching.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tea-room, and hovering round the card-tables, were a vast number of
      queer old ladies, and decrepit old gentlemen, discussing all the small
      talk and scandal of the day, with a relish and gusto which sufficiently
      bespoke the intensity of the pleasure they derived from the occupation.
      Mingled with these groups, were three or four match-making mammas,
      appearing to be wholly absorbed by the conversation in which they were
      taking part, but failing not from time to time to cast an anxious sidelong
      glance upon their daughters, who, remembering the maternal injunction to
      make the best use of their youth, had already commenced incipient
      flirtations in the mislaying scarves, putting on gloves, setting down
      cups, and so forth; slight matters apparently, but which may be turned to
      surprisingly good account by expert practitioners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lounging near the doors, and in remote corners, were various knots of
      silly young men, displaying various varieties of puppyism and stupidity;
      amusing all sensible people near them with their folly and conceit; and
      happily thinking themselves the objects of general admiration&mdash;a wise
      and merciful dispensation which no good man will quarrel with.
    </p>
    <p>
      And lastly, seated on some of the back benches, where they had already
      taken up their positions for the evening, were divers unmarried ladies
      past their grand climacteric, who, not dancing because there were no
      partners for them, and not playing cards lest they should be set down as
      irretrievably single, were in the favourable situation of being able to
      abuse everybody without reflecting on themselves. In short, they could
      abuse everybody, because everybody was there. It was a scene of gaiety,
      glitter, and show; of richly-dressed people, handsome mirrors, chalked
      floors, girandoles and wax-candles; and in all parts of the scene, gliding
      from spot to spot in silent softness, bowing obsequiously to this party,
      nodding familiarly to that, and smiling complacently on all, was the
      sprucely-attired person of Angelo Cyrus Bantam, Esquire, the Master of the
      Ceremonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop in the tea-room. Take your sixpenn&rsquo;orth. Then lay on hot water, and
      call it tea. Drink it,&rsquo; said Mr. Dowler, in a loud voice, directing Mr.
      Pickwick, who advanced at the head of the little party, with Mrs. Dowler
      on his arm. Into the tea-room Mr. Pickwick turned; and catching sight of
      him, Mr. Bantam corkscrewed his way through the crowd and welcomed him
      with ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Sir, I am highly honoured. Ba&mdash;ath is favoured. Mrs. Dowler,
      you embellish the rooms. I congratulate you on your feathers.
      Re-markable!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anybody here?&rsquo; inquired Dowler suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anybody! The <i>elite </i>of Ba&mdash;ath. Mr. Pickwick, do you see the
      old lady in the gauze turban?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fat old lady?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, my dear sir&mdash;nobody&rsquo;s fat or old in Ba&mdash;ath. That&rsquo;s the
      Dowager Lady Snuphanuph.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it, indeed?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No less a person, I assure you,&rsquo; said the Master of the Ceremonies.
      &lsquo;Hush. Draw a little nearer, Mr. Pickwick. You see the splendidly-dressed
      young man coming this way?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The one with the long hair, and the particularly small forehead?&rsquo; 
      inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The same. The richest young man in Ba&mdash;ath at this moment. Young
      Lord Mutanhed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t say so?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. You&rsquo;ll hear his voice in a moment, Mr. Pickwick. He&rsquo;ll speak to me.
      The other gentleman with him, in the red under-waistcoat and dark
      moustache, is the Honourable Mr. Crushton, his bosom friend. How do you
      do, my Lord?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Veway hot, Bantam,&rsquo; said his Lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It <i>is</i> very warm, my Lord,&rsquo; replied the M.C.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Confounded,&rsquo; assented the Honourable Mr. Crushton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you seen his Lordship&rsquo;s mail-cart, Bantam?&rsquo; inquired the Honourable
      Mr. Crushton, after a short pause, during which young Lord Mutanhed had
      been endeavouring to stare Mr. Pickwick out of countenance, and Mr.
      Crushton had been reflecting what subject his Lordship could talk about
      best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, no,&rsquo; replied the M.C. &lsquo;A mail-cart! What an excellent idea.
      Re-markable!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gwacious heavens!&rsquo; said his Lordship, &lsquo;I thought evewebody had seen the
      new mail-cart; it&rsquo;s the neatest, pwettiest, gwacefullest thing that ever
      wan upon wheels. Painted wed, with a cweam piebald.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With a real box for the letters, and all complete,&rsquo; said the Honourable
      Mr. Crushton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a little seat in fwont, with an iwon wail, for the dwiver,&rsquo; added his
      Lordship. &lsquo;I dwove it over to Bwistol the other morning, in a cwimson
      coat, with two servants widing a quarter of a mile behind; and confound me
      if the people didn&rsquo;t wush out of their cottages, and awest my pwogwess, to
      know if I wasn&rsquo;t the post. Glorwious&mdash;glorwious!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this anecdote his Lordship laughed very heartily, as did the listeners,
      of course. Then, drawing his arm through that of the obsequious Mr.
      Crushton, Lord Mutanhed walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Delightful young man, his Lordship,&rsquo; said the Master of the Ceremonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I should think,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dancing having commenced, the necessary introductions having been
      made, and all preliminaries arranged, Angelo Bantam rejoined Mr. Pickwick,
      and led him into the card-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at the very moment of their entrance, the Dowager Lady Snuphanuph and
      two other ladies of an ancient and whist-like appearance, were hovering
      over an unoccupied card-table; and they no sooner set eyes upon Mr.
      Pickwick under the convoy of Angelo Bantam, than they exchanged glances
      with each other, seeing that he was precisely the very person they wanted,
      to make up the rubber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Bantam,&rsquo; said the Dowager Lady Snuphanuph coaxingly, &lsquo;find us
      some nice creature to make up this table; there&rsquo;s a good soul.&rsquo; Mr.
      Pickwick happened to be looking another way at the moment, so her Ladyship
      nodded her head towards him, and frowned expressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friend Mr. Pickwick, my Lady, will be most happy, I am sure,
      remarkably so,&rsquo; said the M.C., taking the hint. &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick, Lady
      Snuphanuph&mdash;Mrs. Colonel Wugsby&mdash;Miss Bolo.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/20141m.jpg" alt="20141m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20141.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick bowed to each of the ladies, and, finding escape impossible,
      cut. Mr. Pickwick and Miss Bolo against Lady Snuphanuph and Mrs. Colonel
      Wugsby.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the trump card was turned up, at the commencement of the second deal,
      two young ladies hurried into the room, and took their stations on either
      side of Mrs. Colonel Wugsby&rsquo;s chair, where they waited patiently until the
      hand was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Jane,&rsquo; said Mrs. Colonel Wugsby, turning to one of the girls, &lsquo;what
      is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I came to ask, ma, whether I might dance with the youngest Mr. Crawley,&rsquo; 
      whispered the prettier and younger of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good God, Jane, how can you think of such things?&rsquo; replied the mamma
      indignantly. &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you repeatedly heard that his father has eight
      hundred a year, which dies with him? I am ashamed of you. Not on any
      account.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ma,&rsquo; whispered the other, who was much older than her sister, and very
      insipid and artificial, &lsquo;Lord Mutanhed has been introduced to me. I said I
      thought I wasn&rsquo;t engaged, ma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a sweet pet, my love,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Colonel Wugsby, tapping her
      daughter&rsquo;s cheek with her fan, &lsquo;and are always to be trusted. He&rsquo;s
      immensely rich, my dear. Bless you!&rsquo; With these words Mrs. Colonel Wugsby
      kissed her eldest daughter most affectionately, and frowning in a warning
      manner upon the other, sorted her cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mr. Pickwick! he had never played with three thorough-paced female
      card-players before. They were so desperately sharp, that they quite
      frightened him. If he played a wrong card, Miss Bolo looked a small
      armoury of daggers; if he stopped to consider which was the right one,
      Lady Snuphanuph would throw herself back in her chair, and smile with a
      mingled glance of impatience and pity to Mrs. Colonel Wugsby, at which
      Mrs. Colonel Wugsby would shrug up her shoulders, and cough, as much as to
      say she wondered whether he ever would begin. Then, at the end of every
      hand, Miss Bolo would inquire with a dismal countenance and reproachful
      sigh, why Mr. Pickwick had not returned that diamond, or led the club, or
      roughed the spade, or finessed the heart, or led through the honour, or
      brought out the ace, or played up to the king, or some such thing; and in
      reply to all these grave charges, Mr. Pickwick would be wholly unable to
      plead any justification whatever, having by this time forgotten all about
      the game. People came and looked on, too, which made Mr. Pickwick nervous.
      Besides all this, there was a great deal of distracting conversation near
      the table, between Angelo Bantam and the two Misses Matinter, who, being
      single and singular, paid great court to the Master of the Ceremonies, in
      the hope of getting a stray partner now and then. All these things,
      combined with the noises and interruptions of constant comings in and
      goings out, made Mr. Pickwick play rather badly; the cards were against
      him, also; and when they left off at ten minutes past eleven, Miss Bolo
      rose from the table considerably agitated, and went straight home, in a
      flood of tears and a sedan-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being joined by his friends, who one and all protested that they had
      scarcely ever spent a more pleasant evening, Mr. Pickwick accompanied them
      to the White Hart, and having soothed his feelings with something hot,
      went to bed, and to sleep, almost simultaneously.

      CHAPTER XXXVI. THE CHIEF FEATURES OF WHICH WILL BE FOUND TO BE AN
      AUTHENTIC VERSION OF THE LEGEND OF PRINCE BLADUD, AND A MOST EXTRAORDINARY
      CALAMITY THAT BEFELL MR. WINKLE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s Mr. Pickwick
      contemplated a stay of at least two months in Bath, he deemed it advisable
      to take private lodgings for himself and friends for that period; and as a
      favourable opportunity offered for their securing, on moderate terms, the
      upper portion of a house in the Royal Crescent, which was larger than they
      required, Mr. and Mrs. Dowler offered to relieve them of a bedroom and
      sitting-room. This proposition was at once accepted, and in three days&rsquo; 
      time they were all located in their new abode, when Mr. Pickwick began to
      drink the waters with the utmost assiduity. Mr. Pickwick took them
      systematically. He drank a quarter of a pint before breakfast, and then
      walked up a hill; and another quarter of a pint after breakfast, and then
      walked down a hill; and, after every fresh quarter of a pint, Mr. Pickwick
      declared, in the most solemn and emphatic terms, that he felt a great deal
      better; whereat his friends were very much delighted, though they had not
      been previously aware that there was anything the matter with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Pump Room is a spacious saloon, ornamented with Corinthian
      pillars, and a music-gallery, and a Tompion clock, and a statue of Nash,
      and a golden inscription, to which all the water-drinkers should attend,
      for it appeals to them in the cause of a deserving charity. There is a
      large bar with a marble vase, out of which the pumper gets the water; and
      there are a number of yellow-looking tumblers, out of which the company
      get it; and it is a most edifying and satisfactory sight to behold the
      perseverance and gravity with which they swallow it. There are baths near
      at hand, in which a part of the company wash themselves; and a band plays
      afterwards, to congratulate the remainder on their having done so. There
      is another pump room, into which infirm ladies and gentlemen are wheeled,
      in such an astonishing variety of chairs and chaises, that any adventurous
      individual who goes in with the regular number of toes, is in imminent
      danger of coming out without them; and there is a third, into which the
      quiet people go, for it is less noisy than either. There is an immensity
      of promenading, on crutches and off, with sticks and without, and a great
      deal of conversation, and liveliness, and pleasantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every morning, the regular water-drinkers, Mr. Pickwick among the number,
      met each other in the pump room, took their quarter of a pint, and walked
      constitutionally. At the afternoon&rsquo;s promenade, Lord Mutanhed, and the
      Honourable Mr. Crushton, the Dowager Lady Snuphanuph, Mrs. Colonel Wugsby,
      and all the great people, and all the morning water-drinkers, met in grand
      assemblage. After this, they walked out, or drove out, or were pushed out
      in bath-chairs, and met one another again. After this, the gentlemen went
      to the reading-rooms, and met divisions of the mass. After this, they went
      home. If it were theatre-night, perhaps they met at the theatre; if it
      were assembly-night, they met at the rooms; and if it were neither, they
      met the next day. A very pleasant routine, with perhaps a slight tinge of
      sameness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was sitting up by himself, after a day spent in this manner,
      making entries in his journal, his friends having retired to bed, when he
      was roused by a gentle tap at the room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beg your pardon, Sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Craddock, the landlady, peeping in; &lsquo;but
      did you want anything more, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing more, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My young girl is gone to bed, Sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Craddock; &lsquo;and Mr. Dowler
      is good enough to say that he&rsquo;ll sit up for Mrs. Dowler, as the party
      isn&rsquo;t expected to be over till late; so I was thinking that if you wanted
      nothing more, Mr. Pickwick, I would go to bed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By all means, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wish you good-night, Sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Craddock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Craddock closed the door, and Mr. Pickwick resumed his writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour&rsquo;s time the entries were concluded. Mr. Pickwick carefully
      rubbed the last page on the blotting-paper, shut up the book, wiped his
      pen on the bottom of the inside of his coat tail, and opened the drawer of
      the inkstand to put it carefully away. There were a couple of sheets of
      writing-paper, pretty closely written over, in the inkstand drawer, and
      they were folded so, that the title, which was in a good round hand, was
      fully disclosed to him. Seeing from this, that it was no private document;
      and as it seemed to relate to Bath, and was very short: Mr. Pick-wick

  THE TRUE LEGEND OF PRINCE BLADUD
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Less than two hundred years ago, on one of the public baths in this city,
      there appeared an inscription in honour of its mighty founder, the
      renowned Prince Bladud. That inscription is now erased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For many hundred years before that time, there had been handed down, from
      age to age, an old legend, that the illustrious prince being afflicted
      with leprosy, on his return from reaping a rich harvest of knowledge in
      Athens, shunned the court of his royal father, and consorted moodily with
      husbandman and pigs. Among the herd (so said the legend) was a pig of
      grave and solemn countenance, with whom the prince had a fellow-feeling&mdash;for
      he too was wise&mdash;a pig of thoughtful and reserved demeanour; an
      animal superior to his fellows, whose grunt was terrible, and whose bite
      was sharp. The young prince sighed deeply as he looked upon the
      countenance of the majestic swine; he thought of his royal father, and his
      eyes were bedewed with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This sagacious pig was fond of bathing in rich, moist mud. Not in summer,
      as common pigs do now, to cool themselves, and did even in those distant
      ages (which is a proof that the light of civilisation had already begun to
      dawn, though feebly), but in the cold, sharp days of winter. His coat was
      ever so sleek, and his complexion so clear, that the prince resolved to
      essay the purifying qualities of the same water that his friend resorted
      to. He made the trial. Beneath that black mud, bubbled the hot springs of
      Bath. He washed, and was cured. Hastening to his father&rsquo;s court, he paid
      his best respects, and returning quickly hither, founded this city and its
      famous baths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He sought the pig with all the ardour of their early friendship&mdash;but,
      alas! the waters had been his death. He had imprudently taken a bath at
      too high a temperature, and the natural philosopher was no more! He was
      succeeded by Pliny, who also fell a victim to his thirst for knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This was the legend. Listen to the true one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A great many centuries since, there flourished, in great state, the
      famous and renowned Lud Hudibras, king of Britain. He was a mighty
      monarch. The earth shook when he walked&mdash;he was so very stout. His
      people basked in the light of his countenance&mdash;it was so red and
      glowing. He was, indeed, every inch a king. And there were a good many
      inches of him, too, for although he was not very tall, he was a remarkable
      size round, and the inches that he wanted in height, he made up in
      circumference. If any degenerate monarch of modern times could be in any
      way compared with him, I should say the venerable King Cole would be that
      illustrious potentate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This good king had a queen, who eighteen years before, had had a son, who
      was called Bladud. He was sent to a preparatory seminary in his father&rsquo;s
      dominions until he was ten years old, and was then despatched, in charge
      of a trusty messenger, to a finishing school at Athens; and as there was
      no extra charge for remaining during the holidays, and no notice required
      previous to the removal of a pupil, there he remained for eight long
      years, at the expiration of which time, the king his father sent the lord
      chamberlain over, to settle the bill, and to bring him home; which, the
      lord chamberlain doing, was received with shouts, and pensioned
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When King Lud saw the prince his son, and found he had grown up such a
      fine young man, he perceived what a grand thing it would be to have him
      married without delay, so that his children might be the means of
      perpetuating the glorious race of Lud, down to the very latest ages of the
      world. With this view, he sent a special embassy, composed of great
      noblemen who had nothing particular to do, and wanted lucrative
      employment, to a neighbouring king, and demanded his fair daughter in
      marriage for his son; stating at the same time that he was anxious to be
      on the most affectionate terms with his brother and friend, but that if
      they couldn&rsquo;t agree in arranging this marriage, he should be under the
      unpleasant necessity of invading his kingdom and putting his eyes out. To
      this, the other king (who was the weaker of the two) replied that he was
      very much obliged to his friend and brother for all his goodness and
      magnanimity, and that his daughter was quite ready to be married, whenever
      Prince Bladud liked to come and fetch her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This answer no sooner reached Britain, than the whole nation was
      transported with joy. Nothing was heard, on all sides, but the sounds of
      feasting and revelry&mdash;except the chinking of money as it was paid in
      by the people to the collector of the royal treasures, to defray the
      expenses of the happy ceremony. It was upon this occasion that King Lud,
      seated on the top of his throne in full council, rose, in the exuberance
      of his feelings, and commanded the lord chief justice to order in the
      richest wines and the court minstrels&mdash;an act of graciousness which
      has been, through the ignorance of traditionary historians, attributed to
      King Cole, in those celebrated lines in which his Majesty is represented
      as
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Calling for his pipe, and calling for his pot,
     And calling for his fiddlers three.
</pre>
    <p>
      Which is an obvious injustice to the memory of King Lud, and a dishonest
      exaltation of the virtues of King Cole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, in the midst of all this festivity and rejoicing, there was one
      individual present, who tasted not when the sparkling wines were poured
      forth, and who danced not, when the minstrels played. This was no other
      than Prince Bladud himself, in honour of whose happiness a whole people
      were, at that very moment, straining alike their throats and
      purse-strings. The truth was, that the prince, forgetting the undoubted
      right of the minister for foreign affairs to fall in love on his behalf,
      had, contrary to every precedent of policy and diplomacy, already fallen
      in love on his own account, and privately contracted himself unto the fair
      daughter of a noble Athenian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here we have a striking example of one of the manifold advantages of
      civilisation and refinement. If the prince had lived in later days, he
      might at once have married the object of his father&rsquo;s choice, and then set
      himself seriously to work, to relieve himself of the burden which rested
      heavily upon him. He might have endeavoured to break her heart by a
      systematic course of insult and neglect; or, if the spirit of her sex, and
      a proud consciousness of her many wrongs had upheld her under this
      ill-treatment, he might have sought to take her life, and so get rid of
      her effectually. But neither mode of relief suggested itself to Prince
      Bladud; so he solicited a private audience, and told his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is an old prerogative of kings to govern everything but their
      passions. King Lud flew into a frightful rage, tossed his crown up to the
      ceiling, and caught it again&mdash;for in those days kings kept their
      crowns on their heads, and not in the Tower&mdash;stamped the ground,
      rapped his forehead, wondered why his own flesh and blood rebelled against
      him, and, finally, calling in his guards, ordered the prince away to
      instant Confinement in a lofty turret; a course of treatment which the
      kings of old very generally pursued towards their sons, when their
      matrimonial inclinations did not happen to point to the same quarter as
      their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When Prince Bladud had been shut up in the lofty turret for the greater
      part of a year, with no better prospect before his bodily eyes than a
      stone wall, or before his mental vision than prolonged imprisonment, he
      naturally began to ruminate on a plan of escape, which, after months of
      preparation, he managed to accomplish; considerately leaving his
      dinner-knife in the heart of his jailer, lest the poor fellow (who had a
      family) should be considered privy to his flight, and punished accordingly
      by the infuriated king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The monarch was frantic at the loss of his son. He knew not on whom to
      vent his grief and wrath, until fortunately bethinking himself of the lord
      chamberlain who had brought him home, he struck off his pension and his
      head together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Meanwhile, the young prince, effectually disguised, wandered on foot
      through his father&rsquo;s dominions, cheered and supported in all his hardships
      by sweet thoughts of the Athenian maid, who was the innocent cause of his
      weary trials. One day he stopped to rest in a country village; and seeing
      that there were gay dances going forward on the green, and gay faces
      passing to and fro, ventured to inquire of a reveller who stood near him,
      the reason for this rejoicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Know you not, O stranger,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;of the recent proclamation of
      our gracious king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Proclamation! No. What proclamation?&rdquo; rejoined the prince&mdash;for he
      had travelled along the by and little-frequented ways, and knew nothing of
      what had passed upon the public roads, such as they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied the peasant, &ldquo;the foreign lady that our prince wished to
      wed, is married to a foreign noble of her own country, and the king
      proclaims the fact, and a great public festival besides; for now, of
      course, Prince Bladud will come back and marry the lady his father chose,
      who they say is as beautiful as the noonday sun. Your health, sir. God
      save the king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The prince remained to hear no more. He fled from the spot, and plunged
      into the thickest recesses of a neighbouring wood. On, on, he wandered,
      night and day; beneath the blazing sun, and the cold pale moon; through
      the dry heat of noon, and the damp cold of night; in the gray light of
      morn, and the red glare of eve. So heedless was he of time or object, that
      being bound for Athens, he wandered as far out of his way as Bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was no city where Bath stands, then. There was no vestige of human
      habitation, or sign of man&rsquo;s resort, to bear the name; but there was the
      same noble country, the same broad expanse of hill and dale, the same
      beautiful channel stealing on, far away, the same lofty mountains which,
      like the troubles of life, viewed at a distance, and partially obscured by
      the bright mist of its morning, lose their ruggedness and asperity, and
      seem all ease and softness. Moved by the gentle beauty of the scene, the
      prince sank upon the green turf, and bathed his swollen feet in his tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the unhappy Bladud, clasping his hands, and mournfully raising
      his eyes towards the sky, &ldquo;would that my wanderings might end here! Would
      that these grateful tears with which I now mourn hope misplaced, and love
      despised, might flow in peace for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wish was heard. It was in the time of the heathen deities, who used
      occasionally to take people at their words, with a promptness, in some
      cases, extremely awkward. The ground opened beneath the prince&rsquo;s feet; he
      sank into the chasm; and instantaneously it closed upon his head for ever,
      save where his hot tears welled up through the earth, and where they have
      continued to gush forth ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is observable that, to this day, large numbers of elderly ladies and
      gentlemen who have been disappointed in procuring partners, and almost as
      many young ones who are anxious to obtain them, repair annually to Bath to
      drink the waters, from which they derive much strength and comfort. This
      is most complimentary to the virtue of Prince Bladud&rsquo;s tears, and strongly
      corroborative of the veracity of this legend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick yawned several times when he had arrived at the end of this
      little manuscript, carefully refolded, and replaced it in the inkstand
      drawer, and then, with a countenance expressive of the utmost weariness,
      lighted his chamber candle, and went upstairs to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped at Mr. Dowler&rsquo;s door, according to custom, and knocked to say
      good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Dowler, &lsquo;going to bed? I wish I was. Dismal night. Windy; isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Good-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick went to his bedchamber, and Mr. Dowler resumed his seat
      before the fire, in fulfilment of his rash promise to sit up till his wife
      came home.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are few things more worrying than sitting up for somebody,
      especially if that somebody be at a party. You cannot help thinking how
      quickly the time passes with them, which drags so heavily with you; and
      the more you think of this, the more your hopes of their speedy arrival
      decline. Clocks tick so loud, too, when you are sitting up alone, and you
      seem as if you had an under-garment of cobwebs on. First, something
      tickles your right knee, and then the same sensation irritates your left.
      You have no sooner changed your position, than it comes again in the arms;
      when you have fidgeted your limbs into all sorts of queer shapes, you have
      a sudden relapse in the nose, which you rub as if to rub it off&mdash;as
      there is no doubt you would, if you could. Eyes, too, are mere personal
      inconveniences; and the wick of one candle gets an inch and a half long,
      while you are snuffing the other. These, and various other little nervous
      annoyances, render sitting up for a length of time after everybody else
      has gone to bed, anything but a cheerful amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was just Mr. Dowler&rsquo;s opinion, as he sat before the fire, and felt
      honestly indignant with all the inhuman people at the party who were
      keeping him up. He was not put into better humour either, by the
      reflection that he had taken it into his head, early in the evening, to
      think he had got an ache there, and so stopped at home. At length, after
      several droppings asleep, and fallings forward towards the bars, and
      catchings backward soon enough to prevent being branded in the face, Mr.
      Dowler made up his mind that he would throw himself on the bed in the back
      room and think&mdash;not sleep, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a heavy sleeper,&rsquo; said Mr. Dowler, as he flung himself on the bed. &lsquo;I
      must keep awake. I suppose I shall hear a knock here. Yes. I thought so. I
      can hear the watchman. There he goes. Fainter now, though. A little
      fainter. He&rsquo;s turning the corner. Ah!&rsquo; When Mr. Dowler arrived at this
      point, he turned the corner at which he had been long hesitating, and fell
      fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the clock struck three, there was blown into the crescent a
      sedan-chair with Mrs. Dowler inside, borne by one short, fat chairman, and
      one long, thin one, who had had much ado to keep their bodies
      perpendicular: to say nothing of the chair. But on that high ground, and
      in the crescent, which the wind swept round and round as if it were going
      to tear the paving stones up, its fury was tremendous. They were very glad
      to set the chair down, and give a good round loud double-knock at the
      street door.
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited some time, but nobody came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Servants is in the arms o&rsquo; Porpus, I think,&rsquo; said the short chairman,
      warming his hands at the attendant link-boy&rsquo;s torch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish he&rsquo;d give &lsquo;em a squeeze and wake &lsquo;em,&rsquo; observed the long one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Knock again, will you, if you please,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Dowler from the chair.
      &lsquo;Knock two or three times, if you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The short man was quite willing to get the job over, as soon as possible;
      so he stood on the step, and gave four or five most startling
      double-knocks, of eight or ten knocks a-piece, while the long man went
      into the road, and looked up at the windows for a light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody came. It was all as silent and dark as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; said Mrs. Dowler. &lsquo;You must knock again, if you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There ain&rsquo;t a bell, is there, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; said the short chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, there is,&rsquo; interposed the link-boy, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been a-ringing at it ever
      so long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only a handle,&rsquo; said Mrs. Dowler, &lsquo;the wire&rsquo;s broken.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish the servants&rsquo; heads wos,&rsquo; growled the long man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must trouble you to knock again, if you please,&rsquo; said Mrs. Dowler, with
      the utmost politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The short man did knock again several times, without producing the
      smallest effect. The tall man, growing very impatient, then relieved him,
      and kept on perpetually knocking double-knocks of two loud knocks each,
      like an insane postman.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Mr. Winkle began to dream that he was at a club, and that the
      members being very refractory, the chairman was obliged to hammer the
      table a good deal to preserve order; then he had a confused notion of an
      auction room where there were no bidders, and the auctioneer was buying
      everything in; and ultimately he began to think it just within the bounds
      of possibility that somebody might be knocking at the street door. To make
      quite certain, however, he remained quiet in bed for ten minutes or so,
      and listened; and when he had counted two or three-and-thirty knocks, he
      felt quite satisfied, and gave himself a great deal of credit for being so
      wakeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rap rap-rap rap-rap rap-ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, rap!&rsquo; went the knocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle jumped out of bed, wondering very much what could possibly be
      the matter, and hastily putting on his stockings and slippers, folded his
      dressing-gown round him, lighted a flat candle from the rush-light that
      was burning in the fireplace, and hurried downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s somebody comin&rsquo; at last, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the short chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I wos behind him vith a bradawl,&rsquo; muttered the long one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; cried Mr. Winkle, undoing the chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t stop to ask questions, cast-iron head,&rsquo; replied the long man, with
      great disgust, taking it for granted that the inquirer was a footman; &lsquo;but
      open the door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, look sharp, timber eyelids,&rsquo; added the other encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle, being half asleep, obeyed the command mechanically, opened the
      door a little, and peeped out. The first thing he saw, was the red glare
      of the link-boy&rsquo;s torch. Startled by the sudden fear that the house might
      be on fire, he hastily threw the door wide open, and holding the candle
      above his head, stared eagerly before him, not quite certain whether what
      he saw was a sedan-chair or a fire-engine. At this instant there came a
      violent gust of wind; the light was blown out; Mr. Winkle felt himself
      irresistibly impelled on to the steps; and the door blew to, with a loud
      crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, young man, now you <i>have </i>done it!&rsquo; said the short chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle, catching sight of a lady&rsquo;s face at the window of the sedan,
      turned hastily round, plied the knocker with all his might and main, and
      called frantically upon the chairman to take the chair away again.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/20155m.jpg" alt="20155m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20155.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take it away, take it away,&rsquo; cried Mr. Winkle. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s somebody coming
      out of another house; put me into the chair. Hide me! Do something with
      me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time he was shivering with cold; and every time he raised his
      hand to the knocker, the wind took the dressing-gown in a most unpleasant
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The people are coming down the crescent now. There are ladies with &lsquo;em;
      cover me up with something. Stand before me!&rsquo; roared Mr. Winkle. But the
      chairmen were too much exhausted with laughing to afford him the slightest
      assistance, and the ladies were every moment approaching nearer and
      nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle gave a last hopeless knock; the ladies were only a few doors
      off. He threw away the extinguished candle, which, all this time he had
      held above his head, and fairly bolted into the sedan-chair where Mrs.
      Dowler was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Mrs. Craddock had heard the knocking and the voices at last; and,
      only waiting to put something smarter on her head than her nightcap, ran
      down into the front drawing-room to make sure that it was the right party.
      Throwing up the window-sash as Mr. Winkle was rushing into the chair, she
      no sooner caught sight of what was going forward below, than she raised a
      vehement and dismal shriek, and implored Mr. Dowler to get up directly,
      for his wife was running away with another gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, Mr. Dowler bounced off the bed as abruptly as an India-rubber
      ball, and rushing into the front room, arrived at one window just as Mr.
      Pickwick threw up the other, when the first object that met the gaze of
      both, was Mr. Winkle bolting into the sedan-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Watchman,&rsquo; shouted Dowler furiously, &lsquo;stop him&mdash;hold him&mdash;keep
      him tight&mdash;shut him in, till I come down. I&rsquo;ll cut his throat&mdash;give
      me a knife&mdash;from ear to ear, Mrs. Craddock&mdash;I will!&rsquo; And
      breaking from the shrieking landlady, and from Mr. Pickwick, the indignant
      husband seized a small supper-knife, and tore into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Winkle didn&rsquo;t wait for him. He no sooner heard the horrible threat
      of the valorous Dowler, than he bounced out of the sedan, quite as quickly
      as he had bounced in, and throwing off his slippers into the road, took to
      his heels and tore round the crescent, hotly pursued by Dowler and the
      watchman. He kept ahead; the door was open as he came round the second
      time; he rushed in, slammed it in Dowler&rsquo;s face, mounted to his bedroom,
      locked the door, piled a wash-hand-stand, chest of drawers, and a table
      against it, and packed up a few necessaries ready for flight with the
      first ray of morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dowler came up to the outside of the door; avowed, through the keyhole,
      his steadfast determination of cutting Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s throat next day; and,
      after a great confusion of voices in the drawing-room, amidst which that
      of Mr. Pickwick was distinctly heard endeavouring to make peace, the
      inmates dispersed to their several bed-chambers, and all was quiet once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not unlikely that the inquiry may be made, where Mr. Weller was, all
      this time? We will state where he was, in the next chapter.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Weller,&rsquo; said
      Mrs. Craddock, upon the morning of this very eventful day, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s a
      letter for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery odd that,&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afeerd there must be somethin&rsquo; the matter,
      for I don&rsquo;t recollect any gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n in my circle of acquaintance as is
      capable o&rsquo; writin&rsquo; one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps something uncommon has taken place,&rsquo; observed Mrs. Craddock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must be somethin&rsquo; wery uncommon indeed, as could perduce a letter out
      o&rsquo; any friend o&rsquo; mine,&rsquo; replied Sam, shaking his head dubiously; &lsquo;nothin&rsquo; 
      less than a nat&rsquo;ral conwulsion, as the young gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n observed ven he wos
      took with fits. It can&rsquo;t be from the gov&rsquo;ner,&rsquo; said Sam, looking at the
      direction. &lsquo;He always prints, I know, &lsquo;cos he learnt writin&rsquo; from the
      large bills in the booking-offices. It&rsquo;s a wery strange thing now, where
      this here letter can ha&rsquo; come from.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Sam said this, he did what a great many people do when they are
      uncertain about the writer of a note&mdash;looked at the seal, and then at
      the front, and then at the back, and then at the sides, and then at the
      superscription; and, as a last resource, thought perhaps he might as well
      look at the inside, and try to find out from that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s wrote on gilt-edged paper,&rsquo; said Sam, as he unfolded it, &lsquo;and sealed
      in bronze vax vith the top of a door key. Now for it.&rsquo; And, with a very
      grave face, Mr. Weller slowly read as follows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A select company of the Bath footmen presents their compliments to Mr.
      Weller, and requests the pleasure of his company this evening, to a
      friendly swarry, consisting of a boiled leg of mutton with the usual
      trimmings. The swarry to be on table at half-past nine o&rsquo;clock
      punctually.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was inclosed in another note, which ran thus&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. John Smauker, the gentleman who had the pleasure of meeting Mr.
      Weller at the house of their mutual acquaintance, Mr. Bantam, a few days
      since, begs to inclose Mr. Weller the herewith invitation. If Mr. Weller
      will call on Mr. John Smauker at nine o&rsquo;clock, Mr. John Smauker will have
      the pleasure of introducing Mr. Weller.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (Signed)           &lsquo;<i>John Smauker</i>.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      The envelope was directed to blank Weller, Esq., at Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s; and in
      a parenthesis, in the left hand corner, were the words &lsquo;airy bell,&rsquo; as an
      instruction to the bearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;this is comin&rsquo; it rayther powerful, this is. I never
      heerd a biled leg o&rsquo; mutton called a swarry afore. I wonder wot they&rsquo;d
      call a roast one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, without waiting to debate the point, Sam at once betook himself
      into the presence of Mr. Pickwick, and requested leave of absence for that
      evening, which was readily granted. With this permission and the
      street-door key, Sam Weller issued forth a little before the appointed
      time, and strolled leisurely towards Queen Square, which he no sooner
      gained than he had the satisfaction of beholding Mr. John Smauker leaning
      his powdered head against a lamp-post at a short distance off, smoking a
      cigar through an amber tube.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you do, Mr. Weller?&rsquo; said Mr. John Smauker, raising his hat
      gracefully with one hand, while he gently waved the other in a
      condescending manner. &lsquo;How do you do, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, reasonably conwalessent,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;How do <i>you </i>find
      yourself, my dear feller?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only so so,&rsquo; said Mr. John Smauker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ve been a-workin&rsquo; too hard,&rsquo; observed Sam. &lsquo;I was fearful you
      would; it won&rsquo;t do, you know; you must not give way to that &lsquo;ere
      uncompromisin&rsquo; spirit o&rsquo; yourn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not so much that, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; replied Mr. John Smauker, &lsquo;as bad
      wine; I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve been dissipating.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s a wery bad complaint, that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And yet the temptation, you see, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; observed Mr. John Smauker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, to be sure,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Plunged into the very vortex of society, you know, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said Mr.
      John Smauker, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dreadful, indeed!&rsquo; rejoined Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s always the way,&rsquo; said Mr. John Smauker; &lsquo;if your destiny leads
      you into public life, and public station, you must expect to be subjected
      to temptations which other people is free from, Mr. Weller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Precisely what my uncle said, ven he vent into the public line,&rsquo; remarked
      Sam, &lsquo;and wery right the old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n wos, for he drank hisself to death
      in somethin&rsquo; less than a quarter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John Smauker looked deeply indignant at any parallel being drawn
      between himself and the deceased gentleman in question; but, as Sam&rsquo;s face
      was in the most immovable state of calmness, he thought better of it, and
      looked affable again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps we had better be walking,&rsquo; said Mr. Smauker, consulting a copper
      timepiece which dwelt at the bottom of a deep watch-pocket, and was raised
      to the surface by means of a black string, with a copper key at the other
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;P&rsquo;raps we had,&rsquo; replied Sam, &lsquo;or they&rsquo;ll overdo the swarry, and that&rsquo;ll
      spile it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you drank the waters, Mr. Weller?&rsquo; inquired his companion, as they
      walked towards High Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Once,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you think of &lsquo;em, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought they was particklery unpleasant,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Mr. John Smauker, &lsquo;you disliked the killibeate taste, perhaps?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about that &lsquo;ere,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;I thought they&rsquo;d a wery
      strong flavour o&rsquo; warm flat irons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That <i>is</i> the killibeate, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; observed Mr. John Smauker
      contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, if it is, it&rsquo;s a wery inexpressive word, that&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;It
      may be, but I ain&rsquo;t much in the chimical line myself, so I can&rsquo;t say.&rsquo; And
      here, to the great horror of Mr. John Smauker, Sam Weller began to
      whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said Mr. John Smauker, agonised at the
      exceeding ungenteel sound, &lsquo;will you take my arm?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, you&rsquo;re wery good, but I won&rsquo;t deprive you of it,&rsquo; replied Sam.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve rayther a way o&rsquo; putting my hands in my pockets, if it&rsquo;s all the
      same to you.&rsquo; As Sam said this, he suited the action to the word, and
      whistled far louder than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This way,&rsquo; said his new friend, apparently much relieved as they turned
      down a by-street; &lsquo;we shall soon be there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall we?&rsquo; said Sam, quite unmoved by the announcement of his close
      vicinity to the select footmen of Bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr. John Smauker. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, Mr. Weller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll see some very handsome uniforms, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; continued Mr. John
      Smauker; &lsquo;and perhaps you&rsquo;ll find some of the gentlemen rather high at
      first, you know, but they&rsquo;ll soon come round.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s wery kind on &lsquo;em,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you know,&rsquo; resumed Mr. John Smauker, with an air of sublime
      protection&mdash;&lsquo;you know, as you&rsquo;re a stranger, perhaps, they&rsquo;ll be
      rather hard upon you at first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They won&rsquo;t be wery cruel, though, will they?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; replied Mr. John Smauker, pulling forth the fox&rsquo;s head, and
      taking a gentlemanly pinch. &lsquo;There are some funny dogs among us, and they
      will have their joke, you know; but you mustn&rsquo;t mind &lsquo;em, you mustn&rsquo;t mind
      &lsquo;em.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll try and bear up agin such a reg&rsquo;lar knock down o&rsquo; talent,&rsquo; replied
      Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; said Mr. John Smauker, putting forth his fox&rsquo;s head, and
      elevating his own; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll stand by you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had reached a small greengrocer&rsquo;s shop, which Mr. John
      Smauker entered, followed by Sam, who, the moment he got behind him,
      relapsed into a series of the very broadest and most unmitigated grins,
      and manifested other demonstrations of being in a highly enviable state of
      inward merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing the greengrocer&rsquo;s shop, and putting their hats on the stairs in
      the little passage behind it, they walked into a small parlour; and here
      the full splendour of the scene burst upon Mr. Weller&rsquo;s view.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of tables were put together in the middle of the parlour, covered
      with three or four cloths of different ages and dates of washing, arranged
      to look as much like one as the circumstances of the case would allow.
      Upon these were laid knives and forks for six or eight people. Some of the
      knife handles were green, others red, and a few yellow; and as all the
      forks were black, the combination of colours was exceedingly striking.
      Plates for a corresponding number of guests were warming behind the
      fender; and the guests themselves were warming before it: the chief and
      most important of whom appeared to be a stoutish gentleman in a bright
      crimson coat with long tails, vividly red breeches, and a cocked hat, who
      was standing with his back to the fire, and had apparently just entered,
      for besides retaining his cocked hat on his head, he carried in his hand a
      high stick, such as gentlemen of his profession usually elevate in a
      sloping position over the roofs of carriages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Smauker, my lad, your fin,&rsquo; said the gentleman with the cocked hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smauker dovetailed the top joint of his right-hand little finger into
      that of the gentleman with the cocked hat, and said he was charmed to see
      him looking so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, they tell me I am looking pretty blooming,&rsquo; said the man with the
      cocked hat, &lsquo;and it&rsquo;s a wonder, too. I&rsquo;ve been following our old woman
      about, two hours a day, for the last fortnight; and if a constant
      contemplation of the manner in which she hooks-and-eyes that infernal
      lavender-coloured old gown of hers behind, isn&rsquo;t enough to throw anybody
      into a low state of despondency for life, stop my quarter&rsquo;s salary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, the assembled selections laughed very heartily; and one gentleman
      in a yellow waistcoat, with a coach-trimming border, whispered a neighbour
      in green-foil smalls, that Tuckle was in spirits to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the bye,&rsquo; said Mr. Tuckle, &lsquo;Smauker, my boy, you&mdash;&rsquo; The remainder
      of the sentence was forwarded into Mr. John Smauker&rsquo;s ear, by whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, dear me, I quite forgot,&rsquo; said Mr. John Smauker. &lsquo;Gentlemen, my
      friend Mr. Weller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sorry to keep the fire off you, Weller,&rsquo; said Mr. Tuckle, with a familiar
      nod. &lsquo;Hope you&rsquo;re not cold, Weller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not by no means, Blazes,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;It &lsquo;ud be a wery chilly subject
      as felt cold wen you stood opposite. You&rsquo;d save coals if they put you
      behind the fender in the waitin&rsquo;-room at a public office, you would.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As this retort appeared to convey rather a personal allusion to Mr.
      Tuckle&rsquo;s crimson livery, that gentleman looked majestic for a few seconds,
      but gradually edging away from the fire, broke into a forced smile, and
      said it wasn&rsquo;t bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery much obliged for your good opinion, sir,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;We shall get
      on by degrees, I des-say. We&rsquo;ll try a better one by and bye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a
      gentleman in orange-coloured plush, accompanied by another selection in
      purple cloth, with a great extent of stocking. The new-comers having been
      welcomed by the old ones, Mr. Tuckle put the question that supper be
      ordered in, which was carried unanimously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greengrocer and his wife then arranged upon the table a boiled leg of
      mutton, hot, with caper sauce, turnips, and potatoes. Mr. Tuckle took the
      chair, and was supported at the other end of the board by the gentleman in
      orange plush. The greengrocer put on a pair of wash-leather gloves to hand
      the plates with, and stationed himself behind Mr. Tuckle&rsquo;s chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harris,&rsquo; said Mr. Tuckle, in a commanding tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said the greengrocer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you got your gloves on?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then take the kiver off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The greengrocer did as he was told, with a show of great humility, and
      obsequiously handed Mr. Tuckle the carving-knife; in doing which, he
      accidentally gaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by that, Sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Tuckle, with great asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, Sir,&rsquo; replied the crestfallen greengrocer, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      mean to do it, Sir; I was up very late last night, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you what my opinion of you is, Harris,&rsquo; said Mr. Tuckle, with a
      most impressive air, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a wulgar beast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Harris, &lsquo;that you won&rsquo;t be severe with me,
      gentlemen. I am very much obliged to you indeed, gentlemen, for your
      patronage, and also for your recommendations, gentlemen, whenever
      additional assistance in waiting is required. I hope, gentlemen, I give
      satisfaction.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you don&rsquo;t, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Tuckle. &lsquo;Very far from it, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We consider you an inattentive reskel,&rsquo; said the gentleman in the orange
      plush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a low thief,&rsquo; added the gentleman in the green-foil smalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And an unreclaimable blaygaird,&rsquo; added the gentleman in purple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor greengrocer bowed very humbly while these little epithets were
      bestowed upon him, in the true spirit of the very smallest tyranny; and
      when everybody had said something to show his superiority, Mr. Tuckle
      proceeded to carve the leg of mutton, and to help the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      This important business of the evening had hardly commenced, when the door
      was thrown briskly open, and another gentleman in a light-blue suit, and
      leaden buttons, made his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Against the rules,&rsquo; said Mr. Tuckle. &lsquo;Too late, too late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; positively I couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rsquo; said the gentleman in blue. &lsquo;I
      appeal to the company. An affair of gallantry now, an appointment at the
      theayter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that indeed,&rsquo; said the gentleman in the orange plush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; raly now, honour bright,&rsquo; said the man in blue. &lsquo;I made a promese to
      fetch our youngest daughter at half-past ten, and she is such an
      uncauminly fine gal, that I raly hadn&rsquo;t the &lsquo;art to disappint her. No
      offence to the present company, Sir, but a petticut, sir&mdash;a petticut,
      Sir, is irrevokeable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I begin to suspect there&rsquo;s something in that quarter,&rsquo; said Tuckle, as
      the new-comer took his seat next Sam, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve remarked, once or twice, that
      she leans very heavy on your shoulder when she gets in and out of the
      carriage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, raly, raly, Tuckle, you shouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the man in blue. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not
      fair. I may have said to one or two friends that she wos a very divine
      creechure, and had refused one or two offers without any hobvus cause, but&mdash;no,
      no, no, indeed, Tuckle&mdash;before strangers, too&mdash;it&rsquo;s not right&mdash;you
      shouldn&rsquo;t. Delicacy, my dear friend, delicacy!&rsquo; And the man in blue,
      pulling up his neckerchief, and adjusting his coat cuffs, nodded and
      frowned as if there were more behind, which he could say if he liked, but
      was bound in honour to suppress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in blue being a light-haired, stiff-necked, free and easy sort of
      footman, with a swaggering air and pert face, had attracted Mr. Weller&rsquo;s
      special attention at first, but when he began to come out in this way, Sam
      felt more than ever disposed to cultivate his acquaintance; so he launched
      himself into the conversation at once, with characteristic independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your health, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;I like your conversation much. I think it&rsquo;s
      wery pretty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the man in blue smiled, as if it were a compliment he was well
      used to; but looked approvingly on Sam at the same time, and said he hoped
      he should be better acquainted with him, for without any flattery at all
      he seemed to have the makings of a very nice fellow about him, and to be
      just the man after his own heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re wery good, sir,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;What a lucky feller you are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you mean?&rsquo; inquired the gentleman in blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That &lsquo;ere young lady,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;She knows wot&rsquo;s wot, she does. Ah! I
      see.&rsquo; Mr. Weller closed one eye, and shook his head from side to side, in
      a manner which was highly gratifying to the personal vanity of the
      gentleman in blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re a cunning fellow, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said that individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;I leave all that &lsquo;ere to you. It&rsquo;s a great deal more
      in your way than mine, as the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n on the right side o&rsquo; the garden
      vall said to the man on the wrong un, ven the mad bull vos a-comin&rsquo; up the
      lane.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said the gentleman in blue, &lsquo;I think she has
      remarked my air and manner, Mr. Weller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think she couldn&rsquo;t wery well be off o&rsquo; that,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you any little thing of that kind in hand, sir?&rsquo; inquired the
      favoured gentleman in blue, drawing a toothpick from his waistcoat pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not exactly,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no daughters at my place, else o&rsquo; course
      I should ha&rsquo; made up to vun on &lsquo;em. As it is, I don&rsquo;t think I can do with
      anythin&rsquo; under a female markis. I might keep up with a young &lsquo;ooman o&rsquo; 
      large property as hadn&rsquo;t a title, if she made wery fierce love to me. Not
      else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course not, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said the gentleman in blue, &lsquo;one can&rsquo;t be
      troubled, you know; and <i>we</i> know, Mr. Weller&mdash;we, who are men
      of the world&mdash;that a good uniform must work its way with the women,
      sooner or later. In fact, that&rsquo;s the only thing, between you and me, that
      makes the service worth entering into.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it, o&rsquo; course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When this confidential dialogue had gone thus far, glasses were placed
      round, and every gentleman ordered what he liked best, before the
      public-house shut up. The gentleman in blue, and the man in orange, who
      were the chief exquisites of the party, ordered &lsquo;cold shrub and water,&rsquo; 
      but with the others, gin-and-water, sweet, appeared to be the favourite
      beverage. Sam called the greengrocer a &lsquo;desp&rsquo;rate willin,&rsquo; and ordered a
      large bowl of punch&mdash;two circumstances which seemed to raise him very
      much in the opinion of the selections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; said the man in blue, with an air of the most consummate
      dandyism, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the ladies; come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear, hear!&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;The young mississes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there was a loud cry of &lsquo;Order,&rsquo; and Mr. John Smauker, as the
      gentleman who had introduced Mr. Weller into that company, begged to
      inform him that the word he had just made use of, was unparliamentary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which word was that &lsquo;ere, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mississes, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. John Smauker, with an alarming frown. &lsquo;We
      don&rsquo;t recognise such distinctions here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, wery good,&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;then I&rsquo;ll amend the obserwation and call &lsquo;em
      the dear creeturs, if Blazes vill allow me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some doubt appeared to exist in the mind of the gentleman in the
      green-foil smalls, whether the chairman could be legally appealed to, as
      &lsquo;Blazes,&rsquo; but as the company seemed more disposed to stand upon their own
      rights than his, the question was not raised. The man with the cocked hat
      breathed short, and looked long at Sam, but apparently thought it as well
      to say nothing, in case he should get the worst of it. After a short
      silence, a gentleman in an embroidered coat reaching down to his heels,
      and a waistcoat of the same which kept one half of his legs warm, stirred
      his gin-and-water with great energy, and putting himself upon his feet,
      all at once by a violent effort, said he was desirous of offering a few
      remarks to the company, whereupon the person in the cocked hat had no
      doubt that the company would be very happy to hear any remarks that the
      man in the long coat might wish to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feel a great delicacy, gentlemen, in coming for&rsquo;ard,&rsquo; said the man in
      the long coat, &lsquo;having the misforchune to be a coachman, and being only
      admitted as a honorary member of these agreeable swarrys, but I do feel
      myself bound, gentlemen&mdash;drove into a corner, if I may use the
      expression&mdash;to make known an afflicting circumstance which has come
      to my knowledge; which has happened I may say within the soap of my
      everyday contemplation. Gentlemen, our friend Mr. Whiffers (everybody
      looked at the individual in orange), our friend Mr. Whiffers has
      resigned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Universal astonishment fell upon the hearers. Each gentleman looked in his
      neighbour&rsquo;s face, and then transferred his glance to the upstanding
      coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may well be sapparised, gentlemen,&rsquo; said the coachman. &lsquo;I will not
      wenchure to state the reasons of this irrepairabel loss to the service,
      but I will beg Mr. Whiffers to state them himself, for the improvement and
      imitation of his admiring friends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion being loudly approved of, Mr. Whiffers explained. He said
      he certainly could have wished to have continued to hold the appointment
      he had just resigned. The uniform was extremely rich and expensive, the
      females of the family was most agreeable, and the duties of the situation
      was not, he was bound to say, too heavy; the principal service that was
      required of him, being, that he should look out of the hall window as much
      as possible, in company with another gentleman, who had also resigned. He
      could have wished to have spared that company the painful and disgusting
      detail on which he was about to enter, but as the explanation had been
      demanded of him, he had no alternative but to state, boldly and
      distinctly, that he had been required to eat cold meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to conceive the disgust which this avowal awakened in the
      bosoms of the hearers. Loud cries of &lsquo;Shame,&rsquo; mingled with groans and
      hisses, prevailed for a quarter of an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Whiffers then added that he feared a portion of this outrage might be
      traced to his own forbearing and accommodating disposition. He had a
      distinct recollection of having once consented to eat salt butter, and he
      had, moreover, on an occasion of sudden sickness in the house, so far
      forgotten himself as to carry a coal-scuttle up to the second floor. He
      trusted he had not lowered himself in the good opinion of his friends by
      this frank confession of his faults; and he hoped the promptness with
      which he had resented the last unmanly outrage on his feelings, to which
      he had referred, would reinstate him in their good opinion, if he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Whiffers&rsquo;s address was responded to, with a shout of admiration, and
      the health of the interesting martyr was drunk in a most enthusiastic
      manner; for this, the martyr returned thanks, and proposed their visitor,
      Mr. Weller&mdash;a gentleman whom he had not the pleasure of an intimate
      acquaintance with, but who was the friend of Mr. John Smauker, which was a
      sufficient letter of recommendation to any society of gentlemen whatever,
      or wherever. On this account, he should have been disposed to have given
      Mr. Weller&rsquo;s health with all the honours, if his friends had been drinking
      wine; but as they were taking spirits by way of a change, and as it might
      be inconvenient to empty a tumbler at every toast, he should propose that
      the honours be understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the conclusion of this speech, everybody took a sip in honour of Sam;
      and Sam having ladled out, and drunk, two full glasses of punch in honour
      of himself, returned thanks in a neat speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery much obliged to you, old fellers,&rsquo; said Sam, ladling away at the
      punch in the most unembarrassed manner possible, &lsquo;for this here
      compliment; which, comin&rsquo; from sich a quarter, is wery overvelmin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve
      heered a good deal on you as a body, but I will say, that I never thought
      you was sich uncommon nice men as I find you air. I only hope you&rsquo;ll take
      care o&rsquo; yourselves, and not compromise nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; your dignity, which is a
      wery charmin&rsquo; thing to see, when one&rsquo;s out a-walkin&rsquo;, and has always made
      me wery happy to look at, ever since I was a boy about half as high as the
      brass-headed stick o&rsquo; my wery respectable friend, Blazes, there. As to the
      wictim of oppression in the suit o&rsquo; brimstone, all I can say of him, is,
      that I hope he&rsquo;ll get jist as good a berth as he deserves; in vitch case
      it&rsquo;s wery little cold swarry as ever he&rsquo;ll be troubled with agin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Sam sat down with a pleasant smile, and his speech having been
      vociferously applauded, the company broke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wy, you don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;re a-goin&rsquo; old feller?&rsquo; said Sam Weller to
      his friend, Mr. John Smauker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must, indeed,&rsquo; said Mr. Smauker; &lsquo;I promised Bantam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, wery well,&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s another thing. P&rsquo;raps he&rsquo;d resign if
      you disappinted him. You ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo;, Blazes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am,&rsquo; said the man with the cocked hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot, and leave three-quarters of a bowl of punch behind you!&rsquo; said Sam;
      &lsquo;nonsense, set down agin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tuckle was not proof against this invitation. He laid aside the cocked
      hat and stick which he had just taken up, and said he would have one
      glass, for good fellowship&rsquo;s sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the gentleman in blue went home the same way as Mr. Tuckle, he was
      prevailed upon to stop too. When the punch was about half gone, Sam
      ordered in some oysters from the green-grocer&rsquo;s shop; and the effect of
      both was so extremely exhilarating, that Mr. Tuckle, dressed out with the
      cocked hat and stick, danced the frog hornpipe among the shells on the
      table, while the gentleman in blue played an accompaniment upon an
      ingenious musical instrument formed of a hair-comb upon a curl-paper. At
      last, when the punch was all gone, and the night nearly so, they sallied
      forth to see each other home. Mr. Tuckle no sooner got into the open air,
      than he was seized with a sudden desire to lie on the curbstone; Sam
      thought it would be a pity to contradict him, and so let him have his own
      way. As the cocked hat would have been spoiled if left there, Sam very
      considerately flattened it down on the head of the gentleman in blue, and
      putting the big stick in his hand, propped him up against his own
      street-door, rang the bell, and walked quietly home.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a much earlier hour next morning than his usual time of rising, Mr.
      Pickwick walked downstairs completely dressed, and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, when Mr. Weller appeared in reply to the
      summons, &lsquo;shut the door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was an unfortunate occurrence here, last night, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Pickwick, &lsquo;which gave Mr. Winkle some cause to apprehend violence from Mr.
      Dowler.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I&rsquo;ve heerd from the old lady downstairs, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I&rsquo;m sorry to say, Sam,&rsquo; continued Mr. Pickwick, with a most perplexed
      countenance, &lsquo;that in dread of this violence, Mr. Winkle has gone away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gone avay!&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Left the house early this morning, without the slightest previous
      communication with me,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;And is gone, I know not
      where.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He should ha&rsquo; stopped and fought it out, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam
      contemptuously. &lsquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t take much to settle that &lsquo;ere Dowler, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I may have my doubts of his great bravery
      and determination also. But however that may be, Mr. Winkle is gone. He
      must be found, Sam. Found and brought back to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And s&rsquo;pose he won&rsquo;t come back, Sir?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must be made, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s to do it, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Sam, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words Mr. Weller left the room, and immediately afterwards was
      heard to shut the street door. In two hours&rsquo; time he returned with so much
      coolness as if he had been despatched on the most ordinary message
      possible, and brought the information that an individual, in every respect
      answering Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s description, had gone over to Bristol that morning,
      by the branch coach from the Royal Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, grasping his hand, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a capital fellow; an
      invaluable fellow. You must follow him, Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cert&rsquo;nly, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The instant you discover him, write to me immediately, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Pickwick. &lsquo;If he attempts to run away from you, knock him down, or lock
      him up. You have my full authority, Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be wery careful, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll tell him,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;that I am highly excited, highly
      displeased, and naturally indignant, at the very extraordinary course he
      has thought proper to pursue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll tell him,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;that if he does not come back to
      this very house, with you, he will come back with me, for I will come and
      fetch him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll mention that &lsquo;ere, Sir,&rsquo; rejoined Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think you can find him, Sam?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking earnestly in
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll find him if he&rsquo;s anyvere,&rsquo; rejoined Sam, with great confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Then the sooner you go the better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these instructions, Mr. Pickwick placed a sum of money in the hands
      of his faithful servitor, and ordered him to start for Bristol
      immediately, in pursuit of the fugitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam put a few necessaries in a carpet-bag, and was ready for starting. He
      stopped when he had got to the end of the passage, and walking quietly
      back, thrust his head in at the parlour door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; whispered Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fully understands my instructions, do I, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope so,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s reg&rsquo;larly understood about the knockin&rsquo; down, is it, Sir?&rsquo; inquired
      Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perfectly,&rsquo; replied Pickwick. &lsquo;Thoroughly. Do what you think necessary.
      You have my orders.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam gave a nod of intelligence, and withdrawing his head from the door,
      set forth on his pilgrimage with a light heart.

      CHAPTER XXXVIII. HOW MR. WINKLE, WHEN HE STEPPED OUT OF THE FRYING-PAN,
      WALKED GENTLY AND COMFORTABLY INTO THE FIRE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he ill-starred
      gentleman who had been the unfortunate cause of the unusual noise and
      disturbance which alarmed the inhabitants of the Royal Crescent in manner
      and form already described, after passing a night of great confusion and
      anxiety, left the roof beneath which his friends still slumbered, bound he
      knew not whither. The excellent and considerate feelings which prompted
      Mr. Winkle to take this step can never be too highly appreciated or too
      warmly extolled. &lsquo;If,&rsquo; reasoned Mr. Winkle with himself&mdash;&lsquo;if this
      Dowler attempts (as I have no doubt he will) to carry into execution his
      threat of personal violence against myself, it will be incumbent on me to
      call him out. He has a wife; that wife is attached to, and dependent on
      him. Heavens! If I should kill him in the blindness of my wrath, what
      would be my feelings ever afterwards!&rsquo; This painful consideration operated
      so powerfully on the feelings of the humane young man, as to cause his
      knees to knock together, and his countenance to exhibit alarming
      manifestations of inward emotion. Impelled by such reflections, he grasped
      his carpet-bag, and creeping stealthily downstairs, shut the detestable
      street door with as little noise as possible, and walked off. Bending his
      steps towards the Royal Hotel, he found a coach on the point of starting
      for Bristol, and, thinking Bristol as good a place for his purpose as any
      other he could go to, he mounted the box, and reached his place of
      destination in such time as the pair of horses, who went the whole stage
      and back again, twice a day or more, could be reasonably supposed to
      arrive there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up his quarters at the Bush, and designing to postpone any
      communication by letter with Mr. Pickwick until it was probable that Mr.
      Dowler&rsquo;s wrath might have in some degree evaporated, walked forth to view
      the city, which struck him as being a shade more dirty than any place he
      had ever seen. Having inspected the docks and shipping, and viewed the
      cathedral, he inquired his way to Clifton, and being directed thither,
      took the route which was pointed out to him. But as the pavements of
      Bristol are not the widest or cleanest upon earth, so its streets are not
      altogether the straightest or least intricate; and Mr. Winkle, being
      greatly puzzled by their manifold windings and twistings, looked about him
      for a decent shop in which he could apply afresh for counsel and
      instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eye fell upon a newly-painted tenement which had been recently
      converted into something between a shop and a private house, and which a
      red lamp, projecting over the fanlight of the street door, would have
      sufficiently announced as the residence of a medical practitioner, even if
      the word &lsquo;Surgery&rsquo; had not been inscribed in golden characters on a
      wainscot ground, above the window of what, in times bygone, had been the
      front parlour. Thinking this an eligible place wherein to make his
      inquiries, Mr. Winkle stepped into the little shop where the gilt-labelled
      drawers and bottles were; and finding nobody there, knocked with a
      half-crown on the counter, to attract the attention of anybody who might
      happen to be in the back parlour, which he judged to be the innermost and
      peculiar sanctum of the establishment, from the repetition of the word
      surgery on the door&mdash;painted in white letters this time, by way of
      taking off the monotony.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first knock, a sound, as of persons fencing with fire-irons, which
      had until now been very audible, suddenly ceased; at the second, a
      studious-looking young gentleman in green spectacles, with a very large
      book in his hand, glided quietly into the shop, and stepping behind the
      counter, requested to know the visitor&rsquo;s pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry to trouble you, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, &lsquo;but will you have the
      goodness to direct me to&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; roared the studious young gentleman, throwing the large book
      up into the air, and catching it with great dexterity at the very moment
      when it threatened to smash to atoms all the bottles on the counter.
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a start!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, without doubt; for Mr. Winkle was so very much astonished at
      the extraordinary behaviour of the medical gentleman, that he
      involuntarily retreated towards the door, and looked very much disturbed
      at his strange reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, don&rsquo;t you know me?&rsquo; said the medical gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle murmured, in reply, that he had not that pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then,&rsquo; said the medical gentleman, &lsquo;there are hopes for me yet; I
      may attend half the old women in Bristol, if I&rsquo;ve decent luck. Get out,
      you mouldy old villain, get out!&rsquo; With this adjuration, which was
      addressed to the large book, the medical gentleman kicked the volume with
      remarkable agility to the farther end of the shop, and, pulling off his
      green spectacles, grinned the identical grin of Robert Sawyer, Esquire,
      formerly of Guy&rsquo;s Hospital in the Borough, with a private residence in
      Lant Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you weren&rsquo;t down upon me?&rsquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer,
      shaking Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s hand with friendly warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word I was not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle, returning his pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder you didn&rsquo;t see the name,&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer, calling his friend&rsquo;s
      attention to the outer door, on which, in the same white paint, were
      traced the words &lsquo;Sawyer, late Nockemorf.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It never caught my eye,&rsquo; returned Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord, if I had known who you were, I should have rushed out, and caught
      you in my arms,&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer; &lsquo;but upon my life, I thought you were
      the King&rsquo;s-taxes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did, indeed,&rsquo; responded Bob Sawyer, &lsquo;and I was just going to say that I
      wasn&rsquo;t at home, but if you&rsquo;d leave a message I&rsquo;d be sure to give it to
      myself; for he don&rsquo;t know me; no more does the Lighting and Paving. I
      think the Church-rates guesses who I am, and I know the Water-works does,
      because I drew a tooth of his when I first came down here. But come in,
      come in!&rsquo; Chattering in this way, Mr. Bob Sawyer pushed Mr. Winkle into
      the back room, where, amusing himself by boring little circular caverns in
      the chimney-piece with a red-hot poker, sat no less a person than Mr.
      Benjamin Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle. &lsquo;This is indeed a pleasure I did not expect. What
      a very nice place you have here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty well, pretty well,&rsquo; replied Bob Sawyer. &lsquo;I <i>passed</i>, soon
      after that precious party, and my friends came down with the needful for
      this business; so I put on a black suit of clothes, and a pair of
      spectacles, and came here to look as solemn as I could.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a very snug little business you have, no doubt?&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle
      knowingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very,&rsquo; replied Bob Sawyer. &lsquo;So snug, that at the end of a few years you
      might put all the profits in a wine-glass, and cover &lsquo;em over with a
      gooseberry leaf.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot surely mean that?&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle. &lsquo;The stock itself&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dummies, my dear boy,&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer; &lsquo;half the drawers have nothing in
      &lsquo;em, and the other half don&rsquo;t open.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fact&mdash;honour!&rsquo; returned Bob Sawyer, stepping out into the shop, and
      demonstrating the veracity of the assertion by divers hard pulls at the
      little gilt knobs on the counterfeit drawers. &lsquo;Hardly anything real in the
      shop but the leeches, and <i>they </i>are second-hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought it!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Winkle, much surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope not,&rsquo; replied Bob Sawyer, &lsquo;else where&rsquo;s the use of appearances,
      eh? But what will you take? Do as we do? That&rsquo;s right. Ben, my fine
      fellow, put your hand into the cupboard, and bring out the patent
      digester.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Benjamin Allen smiled his readiness, and produced from the closet at
      his elbow a black bottle half full of brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t take water, of course?&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s rather early. I should like to
      qualify it, if you have no objection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None in the least, if you can reconcile it to your conscience,&rsquo; replied
      Bob Sawyer, tossing off, as he spoke, a glass of the liquor with great
      relish. &lsquo;Ben, the pipkin!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Benjamin Allen drew forth, from the same hiding-place, a small brass
      pipkin, which Bob Sawyer observed he prided himself upon, particularly
      because it looked so business-like. The water in the professional pipkin
      having been made to boil, in course of time, by various little shovelfuls
      of coal, which Mr. Bob Sawyer took out of a practicable window-seat,
      labelled &lsquo;Soda Water,&rsquo; Mr. Winkle adulterated his brandy; and the
      conversation was becoming general, when it was interrupted by the entrance
      into the shop of a boy, in a sober gray livery and a gold-laced hat, with
      a small covered basket under his arm, whom Mr. Bob Sawyer immediately
      hailed with, &lsquo;Tom, you vagabond, come here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy presented himself accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been stopping to &ldquo;over&rdquo; all the posts in Bristol, you idle young
      scamp!&rsquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir, I haven&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better not!&rsquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer, with a threatening aspect. &lsquo;Who
      do you suppose will ever employ a professional man, when they see his boy
      playing at marbles in the gutter, or flying the garter in the horse-road?
      Have you no feeling for your profession, you groveller? Did you leave all
      the medicine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The powders for the child, at the large house with the new family, and
      the pills to be taken four times a day at the ill-tempered old gentleman&rsquo;s
      with the gouty leg?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then shut the door, and mind the shop.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, as the boy retired, &lsquo;things are not quite so bad
      as you would have me believe, either. There is <i>some </i>medicine to be
      sent out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bob Sawyer peeped into the shop to see that no stranger was within
      hearing, and leaning forward to Mr. Winkle, said, in a low tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He leaves it all at the wrong houses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle looked perplexed, and Bob Sawyer and his friend laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rsquo; said Bob. &lsquo;He goes up to a house, rings the area bell,
      pokes a packet of medicine without a direction into the servant&rsquo;s hand,
      and walks off. Servant takes it into the dining-parlour; master opens it,
      and reads the label: &ldquo;Draught to be taken at bedtime&mdash;pills as before&mdash;lotion
      as usual&mdash;the powder. From Sawyer&rsquo;s, late Nockemorf&rsquo;s. Physicians&rsquo; 
      prescriptions carefully prepared,&rdquo; and all the rest of it. Shows it to his
      wife&mdash;she reads the label; it goes down to the servants&mdash;<i>they</i>
      read the label. Next day, boy calls: &ldquo;Very sorry&mdash;his mistake&mdash;immense
      business&mdash;great many parcels to deliver&mdash;Mr. Sawyer&rsquo;s
      compliments&mdash;late Nockemorf.&rdquo; The name gets known, and that&rsquo;s the
      thing, my boy, in the medical way. Bless your heart, old fellow, it&rsquo;s
      better than all the advertising in the world. We have got one four-ounce
      bottle that&rsquo;s been to half the houses in Bristol, and hasn&rsquo;t done yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, I see,&rsquo; observed Mr. Winkle; &lsquo;what an excellent plan!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Ben and I have hit upon a dozen such,&rsquo; replied Bob Sawyer, with great
      glee. &lsquo;The lamplighter has eighteenpence a week to pull the night-bell for
      ten minutes every time he comes round; and my boy always rushes into the
      church just before the psalms, when the people have got nothing to do but
      look about &lsquo;em, and calls me out, with horror and dismay depicted on his
      countenance. &ldquo;Bless my soul,&rdquo; everybody says, &ldquo;somebody taken suddenly
      ill! Sawyer, late Nockemorf, sent for. What a business that young man
      has!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the termination of this disclosure of some of the mysteries of
      medicine, Mr. Bob Sawyer and his friend, Ben Allen, threw themselves back
      in their respective chairs, and laughed boisterously. When they had
      enjoyed the joke to their heart&rsquo;s content, the discourse changed to topics
      in which Mr. Winkle was more immediately interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      We think we have hinted elsewhere, that Mr. Benjamin Allen had a way of
      becoming sentimental after brandy. The case is not a peculiar one, as we
      ourself can testify, having, on a few occasions, had to deal with patients
      who have been afflicted in a similar manner. At this precise period of his
      existence, Mr. Benjamin Allen had perhaps a greater predisposition to
      maudlinism than he had ever known before; the cause of which malady was
      briefly this. He had been staying nearly three weeks with Mr. Bob Sawyer;
      Mr. Bob Sawyer was not remarkable for temperance, nor was Mr. Benjamin
      Allen for the ownership of a very strong head; the consequence was that,
      during the whole space of time just mentioned, Mr. Benjamin Allen had been
      wavering between intoxication partial, and intoxication complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear friend,&rsquo; said Mr. Ben Allen, taking advantage of Mr. Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s
      temporary absence behind the counter, whither he had retired to dispense
      some of the second-hand leeches, previously referred to; &lsquo;my dear friend,
      I am very miserable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle professed his heartfelt regret to hear it, and begged to know
      whether he could do anything to alleviate the sorrows of the suffering
      student.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, my dear boy, nothing,&rsquo; said Ben. &lsquo;You recollect Arabella,
      Winkle? My sister Arabella&mdash;a little girl, Winkle, with black eyes&mdash;when
      we were down at Wardle&rsquo;s? I don&rsquo;t know whether you happened to notice her&mdash;a
      nice little girl, Winkle. Perhaps my features may recall her countenance
      to your recollection?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle required nothing to recall the charming Arabella to his mind;
      and it was rather fortunate he did not, for the features of her brother
      Benjamin would unquestionably have proved but an indifferent refresher to
      his memory. He answered, with as much calmness as he could assume, that he
      perfectly remembered the young lady referred to, and sincerely trusted she
      was in good health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our friend Bob is a delightful fellow, Winkle,&rsquo; was the only reply of Mr.
      Ben Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, not much relishing this close connection of the
      two names.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I designed &lsquo;em for each other; they were made for each other, sent into
      the world for each other, born for each other, Winkle,&rsquo; said Mr. Ben
      Allen, setting down his glass with emphasis. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a special destiny in
      the matter, my dear sir; there&rsquo;s only five years&rsquo; difference between &lsquo;em,
      and both their birthdays are in August.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle was too anxious to hear what was to follow to express much
      wonderment at this extraordinary coincidence, marvellous as it was; so Mr.
      Ben Allen, after a tear or two, went on to say that, notwithstanding all
      his esteem and respect and veneration for his friend, Arabella had
      unaccountably and undutifully evinced the most determined antipathy to his
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I think,&rsquo; said Mr. Ben Allen, in conclusion. &lsquo;I think there&rsquo;s a prior
      attachment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you any idea who the object of it might be?&rsquo; asked Mr. Winkle, with
      great trepidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ben Allen seized the poker, flourished it in a warlike manner above
      his head, inflicted a savage blow on an imaginary skull, and wound up by
      saying, in a very expressive manner, that he only wished he could guess;
      that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d show him what I thought of him,&rsquo; said Mr. Ben Allen. And round went
      the poker again, more fiercely than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was, of course, very soothing to the feelings of Mr. Winkle, who
      remained silent for a few minutes; but at length mustered up resolution to
      inquire whether Miss Allen was in Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Mr. Ben Allen, laying aside the poker, and looking very
      cunning; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t think Wardle&rsquo;s exactly the place for a headstrong girl;
      so, as I am her natural protector and guardian, our parents being dead, I
      have brought her down into this part of the country to spend a few months
      at an old aunt&rsquo;s, in a nice, dull, close place. I think that will cure
      her, my boy. If it doesn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll take her abroad for a little while, and
      see what that&rsquo;ll do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the aunt&rsquo;s is in Bristol, is it?&rsquo; faltered Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, not in Bristol,&rsquo; replied Mr. Ben Allen, jerking his thumb over
      his right shoulder; &lsquo;over that way&mdash;down there. But, hush, here&rsquo;s
      Bob. Not a word, my dear friend, not a word.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Short as this conversation was, it roused in Mr. Winkle the highest degree
      of excitement and anxiety. The suspected prior attachment rankled in his
      heart. Could he be the object of it? Could it be for him that the fair
      Arabella had looked scornfully on the sprightly Bob Sawyer, or had he a
      successful rival? He determined to see her, cost what it might; but here
      an insurmountable objection presented itself, for whether the explanatory
      &lsquo;over that way,&rsquo; and &lsquo;down there,&rsquo; of Mr. Ben Allen, meant three miles
      off, or thirty, or three hundred, he could in no wise guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had no opportunity of pondering over his love just then, for Bob
      Sawyer&rsquo;s return was the immediate precursor of the arrival of a meat-pie
      from the baker&rsquo;s, of which that gentleman insisted on his staying to
      partake. The cloth was laid by an occasional charwoman, who officiated in
      the capacity of Mr. Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s housekeeper; and a third knife and fork
      having been borrowed from the mother of the boy in the gray livery (for
      Mr. Sawyer&rsquo;s domestic arrangements were as yet conducted on a limited
      scale), they sat down to dinner; the beer being served up, as Mr. Sawyer
      remarked, &lsquo;in its native pewter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, Mr. Bob Sawyer ordered in the largest mortar in the shop,
      and proceeded to brew a reeking jorum of rum-punch therein, stirring up
      and amalgamating the materials with a pestle in a very creditable and
      apothecary-like manner. Mr. Sawyer, being a bachelor, had only one tumbler
      in the house, which was assigned to Mr. Winkle as a compliment to the
      visitor, Mr. Ben Allen being accommodated with a funnel with a cork in the
      narrow end, and Bob Sawyer contented himself with one of those wide-lipped
      crystal vessels inscribed with a variety of cabalistic characters, in
      which chemists are wont to measure out their liquid drugs in compounding
      prescriptions. These preliminaries adjusted, the punch was tasted, and
      pronounced excellent; and it having been arranged that Bob Sawyer and Ben
      Allen should be considered at liberty to fill twice to Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s once,
      they started fair, with great satisfaction and good-fellowship.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no singing, because Mr. Bob Sawyer said it wouldn&rsquo;t look
      professional; but to make amends for this deprivation there was so much
      talking and laughing that it might have been heard, and very likely was,
      at the end of the street. Which conversation materially lightened the
      hours and improved the mind of Mr. Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s boy, who, instead of
      devoting the evening to his ordinary occupation of writing his name on the
      counter, and rubbing it out again, peeped through the glass door, and thus
      listened and looked on at the same time.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/20185m.jpg" alt="20185m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20185.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The mirth of Mr. Bob Sawyer was rapidly ripening into the furious, Mr. Ben
      Allen was fast relapsing into the sentimental, and the punch had well-nigh
      disappeared altogether, when the boy hastily running in, announced that a
      young woman had just come over, to say that Sawyer late Nockemorf was
      wanted directly, a couple of streets off. This broke up the party. Mr. Bob
      Sawyer, understanding the message, after some twenty repetitions, tied a
      wet cloth round his head to sober himself, and, having partially
      succeeded, put on his green spectacles and issued forth. Resisting all
      entreaties to stay till he came back, and finding it quite impossible to
      engage Mr. Ben Allen in any intelligible conversation on the subject
      nearest his heart, or indeed on any other, Mr. Winkle took his departure,
      and returned to the Bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      The anxiety of his mind, and the numerous meditations which Arabella had
      awakened, prevented his share of the mortar of punch producing that effect
      upon him which it would have had under other circumstances. So, after
      taking a glass of soda-water and brandy at the bar, he turned into the
      coffee-room, dispirited rather than elevated by the occurrences of the
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting in front of the fire, with his back towards him, was a tallish
      gentleman in a greatcoat: the only other occupant of the room. It was
      rather a cool evening for the season of the year, and the gentleman drew
      his chair aside to afford the new-comer a sight of the fire. What were Mr.
      Winkle&rsquo;s feelings when, in doing so, he disclosed to view the face and
      figure of the vindictive and sanguinary Dowler!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s first impulse was to give a violent pull at the nearest
      bell-handle, but that unfortunately happened to be immediately behind Mr.
      Dowler&rsquo;s head. He had made one step towards it, before he checked himself.
      As he did so, Mr. Dowler very hastily drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Winkle, Sir. Be calm. Don&rsquo;t strike me. I won&rsquo;t bear it. A blow!
      Never!&rsquo; said Mr. Dowler, looking meeker than Mr. Winkle had expected in a
      gentleman of his ferocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A blow, Sir?&rsquo; stammered Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A blow, Sir,&rsquo; replied Dowler. &lsquo;Compose your feelings. Sit down. Hear me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, trembling from head to foot, &lsquo;before I consent to
      sit down beside, or opposite you, without the presence of a waiter, I must
      be secured by some further understanding. You used a threat against me
      last night, Sir, a dreadful threat, Sir.&rsquo; Here Mr. Winkle turned very pale
      indeed, and stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did,&rsquo; said Dowler, with a countenance almost as white as Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s.
      &lsquo;Circumstances were suspicious. They have been explained. I respect your
      bravery. Your feeling is upright. Conscious innocence. There&rsquo;s my hand.
      Grasp it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, hesitating whether to give his hand or
      not, and almost fearing that it was demanded in order that he might be
      taken at an advantage, &lsquo;really, Sir, I&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know what you mean,&rsquo; interposed Dowler. &lsquo;You feel aggrieved. Very
      natural. So should I. I was wrong. I beg your pardon. Be friendly. Forgive
      me.&rsquo; With this, Dowler fairly forced his hand upon Mr. Winkle, and shaking
      it with the utmost vehemence, declared he was a fellow of extreme spirit,
      and he had a higher opinion of him than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Dowler, &lsquo;sit down. Relate it all. How did you find me? When
      did you follow? Be frank. Tell me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s quite accidental,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle, greatly perplexed by the
      curious and unexpected nature of the interview. &lsquo;Quite.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Glad of it,&rsquo; said Dowler. &lsquo;I woke this morning. I had forgotten my
      threat. I laughed at the accident. I felt friendly. I said so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To whom?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Mrs. Dowler. &ldquo;You made a vow,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It was a
      rash one,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It was,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll apologise. Where is he?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You,&rsquo; replied Dowler. &lsquo;I went downstairs. You were not to be found.
      Pickwick looked gloomy. Shook his head. Hoped no violence would be
      committed. I saw it all. You felt yourself insulted. You had gone, for a
      friend perhaps. Possibly for pistols. &ldquo;High spirit,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I admire
      him.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle coughed, and beginning to see how the land lay, assumed a look
      of importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I left a note for you,&rsquo; resumed Dowler. &lsquo;I said I was sorry. So I was.
      Pressing business called me here. You were not satisfied. You followed.
      You required a verbal explanation. You were right. It&rsquo;s all over now. My
      business is finished. I go back to-morrow. Join me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Dowler progressed in his explanation, Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s countenance grew
      more and more dignified. The mysterious nature of the commencement of
      their conversation was explained; Mr. Dowler had as great an objection to
      duelling as himself; in short, this blustering and awful personage was one
      of the most egregious cowards in existence, and interpreting Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s
      absence through the medium of his own fears, had taken the same step as
      himself, and prudently retired until all excitement of feeling should have
      subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the real state of the case dawned upon Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s mind, he looked
      very terrible, and said he was perfectly satisfied; but at the same time,
      said so with an air that left Mr. Dowler no alternative but to infer that
      if he had not been, something most horrible and destructive must
      inevitably have occurred. Mr. Dowler appeared to be impressed with a
      becoming sense of Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s magnanimity and condescension; and the two
      belligerents parted for the night, with many protestations of eternal
      friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half-past twelve o&rsquo;clock, when Mr. Winkle had been revelling some
      twenty minutes in the full luxury of his first sleep, he was suddenly
      awakened by a loud knocking at his chamber door, which, being repeated
      with increased vehemence, caused him to start up in bed, and inquire who
      was there, and what the matter was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please, Sir, here&rsquo;s a young man which says he must see you directly,&rsquo; 
      responded the voice of the chambermaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A young man!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No mistake about that &lsquo;ere, Sir,&rsquo; replied another voice through the
      keyhole; &lsquo;and if that wery same interestin&rsquo; young creetur ain&rsquo;t let in
      vithout delay, it&rsquo;s wery possible as his legs vill enter afore his
      countenance.&rsquo; The young man gave a gentle kick at one of the lower panels
      of the door, after he had given utterance to this hint, as if to add force
      and point to the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that you, Sam?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Winkle, springing out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite unpossible to identify any gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n vith any degree o&rsquo; mental
      satisfaction, vithout lookin&rsquo; at him, Sir,&rsquo; replied the voice
      dogmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle, not much doubting who the young man was, unlocked the door;
      which he had no sooner done than Mr. Samuel Weller entered with great
      precipitation, and carefully relocking it on the inside, deliberately put
      the key in his waistcoat pocket; and, after surveying Mr. Winkle from head
      to foot, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a wery humorous young gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, you air, Sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by this conduct, Sam?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Winkle indignantly.
      &lsquo;Get out, sir, this instant. What do you mean, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do I mean,&rsquo; retorted Sam; &lsquo;come, Sir, this is rayther too rich, as
      the young lady said when she remonstrated with the pastry-cook, arter he&rsquo;d
      sold her a pork pie as had got nothin&rsquo; but fat inside. What do I mean!
      Well, that ain&rsquo;t a bad &lsquo;un, that ain&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unlock that door, and leave this room immediately, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall leave this here room, sir, just precisely at the wery same moment
      as you leaves it,&rsquo; responded Sam, speaking in a forcible manner, and
      seating himself with perfect gravity. &lsquo;If I find it necessary to carry you
      away, pick-a-back, o&rsquo; course I shall leave it the least bit o&rsquo; time
      possible afore you; but allow me to express a hope as you won&rsquo;t reduce me
      to extremities; in saying wich, I merely quote wot the nobleman said to
      the fractious pennywinkle, ven he vouldn&rsquo;t come out of his shell by means
      of a pin, and he conseqvently began to be afeered that he should be
      obliged to crack him in the parlour door.&rsquo; At the end of this address,
      which was unusually lengthy for him, Mr. Weller planted his hands on his
      knees, and looked full in Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s face, with an expression of
      countenance which showed that he had not the remotest intention of being
      trifled with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a amiably-disposed young man, Sir, I don&rsquo;t think,&rsquo; resumed Mr.
      Weller, in a tone of moral reproof, &lsquo;to go inwolving our precious governor
      in all sorts o&rsquo; fanteegs, wen he&rsquo;s made up his mind to go through
      everythink for principle. You&rsquo;re far worse nor Dodson, Sir; and as for
      Fogg, I consider him a born angel to you!&rsquo; Mr. Weller having accompanied
      this last sentiment with an emphatic slap on each knee, folded his arms
      with a look of great disgust, and threw himself back in his chair, as if
      awaiting the criminal&rsquo;s defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good fellow,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, extending his hand&mdash;his teeth
      chattering all the time he spoke, for he had been standing, during the
      whole of Mr. Weller&rsquo;s lecture, in his night-gear&mdash;&lsquo;my good fellow, I
      respect your attachment to my excellent friend, and I am very sorry indeed
      to have added to his causes for disquiet. There, Sam, there!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Sam, rather sulkily, but giving the proffered hand a
      respectful shake at the same time&mdash;&lsquo;well, so you ought to be, and I
      am very glad to find you air; for, if I can help it, I won&rsquo;t have him put
      upon by nobody, and that&rsquo;s all about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle. &lsquo;There! Now go to bed, Sam, and
      we&rsquo;ll talk further about this in the morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m wery sorry,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;but I can&rsquo;t go to bed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not go to bed!&rsquo; repeated Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Sam, shaking his head. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t be done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;re going back to-night, Sam?&rsquo; urged Mr. Winkle,
      greatly surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not unless you particklerly wish it,&rsquo; replied Sam; &lsquo;but I mustn&rsquo;t leave
      this here room. The governor&rsquo;s orders wos peremptory.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, &lsquo;I must stop here two or three days; and
      more than that, Sam, you must stop here too, to assist me in gaining an
      interview with a young lady&mdash;Miss Allen, Sam; you remember her&mdash;whom
      I must and will see before I leave Bristol.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But in reply to each of these positions, Sam shook his head with great
      firmness, and energetically replied, &lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After a great deal of argument and representation on the part of Mr.
      Winkle, however, and a full disclosure of what had passed in the interview
      with Dowler, Sam began to waver; and at length a compromise was effected,
      of which the following were the main and principal conditions:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      That Sam should retire, and leave Mr. Winkle in the undisturbed possession
      of his apartment, on the condition that he had permission to lock the door
      on the outside, and carry off the key; provided always, that in the event
      of an alarm of fire, or other dangerous contingency, the door should be
      instantly unlocked. That a letter should be written to Mr. Pickwick early
      next morning, and forwarded per Dowler, requesting his consent to Sam and
      Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s remaining at Bristol, for the purpose and with the object
      already assigned, and begging an answer by the next coach&mdash;, if
      favourable, the aforesaid parties to remain accordingly, and if not, to
      return to Bath immediately on the receipt thereof. And, lastly, that Mr.
      Winkle should be understood as distinctly pledging himself not to resort
      to the window, fireplace, or other surreptitious mode of escape in the
      meanwhile. These stipulations having been concluded, Sam locked the door
      and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had nearly got downstairs, when he stopped, and drew the key from his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I quite forgot about the knockin&rsquo; down,&rsquo; said Sam, half turning back.
      &lsquo;The governor distinctly said it was to be done. Amazin&rsquo; stupid o&rsquo; me,
      that &lsquo;ere! Never mind,&rsquo; said Sam, brightening up, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s easily done
      to-morrow, anyvays.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently much consoled by this reflection, Mr. Weller once more
      deposited the key in his pocket, and descending the remainder of the
      stairs without any fresh visitations of conscience, was soon, in common
      with the other inmates of the house, buried in profound repose.

      CHAPTER XXXIX. MR. SAMUEL WELLER, BEING INTRUSTED WITH A MISSION OF LOVE,
      PROCEEDS TO EXECUTE IT; WITH WHAT SUCCESS WILL HEREINAFTER APPEAR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>uring the whole of
      next day, Sam kept Mr. Winkle steadily in sight, fully determined not to
      take his eyes off him for one instant, until he should receive express
      instructions from the fountain-head. However disagreeable Sam&rsquo;s very close
      watch and great vigilance were to Mr. Winkle, he thought it better to bear
      with them, than, by any act of violent opposition, to hazard being carried
      away by force, which Mr. Weller more than once strongly hinted was the
      line of conduct that a strict sense of duty prompted him to pursue. There
      is little reason to doubt that Sam would very speedily have quieted his
      scruples, by bearing Mr. Winkle back to Bath, bound hand and foot, had not
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s prompt attention to the note, which Dowler had undertaken
      to deliver, forestalled any such proceeding. In short, at eight o&rsquo;clock in
      the evening, Mr. Pickwick himself walked into the coffee-room of the Bush
      Tavern, and told Sam with a smile, to his very great relief, that he had
      done quite right, and it was unnecessary for him to mount guard any
      longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought it better to come myself,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, addressing Mr.
      Winkle, as Sam disencumbered him of his great-coat and travelling-shawl,
      &lsquo;to ascertain, before I gave my consent to Sam&rsquo;s employment in this
      matter, that you are quite in earnest and serious, with respect to this
      young lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serious, from my heart&mdash;from my soul!&rsquo; returned Mr. Winkle, with
      great energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Remember,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with beaming eyes, &lsquo;we met her at our
      excellent and hospitable friend&rsquo;s, Winkle. It would be an ill return to
      tamper lightly, and without due consideration, with this young lady&rsquo;s
      affections. I&rsquo;ll not allow that, sir. I&rsquo;ll not allow it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no such intention, indeed,&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Winkle warmly. &lsquo;I have
      considered the matter well, for a long time, and I feel that my happiness
      is bound up in her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s wot we call tying it up in a small parcel, sir,&rsquo; interposed Mr.
      Weller, with an agreeable smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle looked somewhat stern at this interruption, and Mr. Pickwick
      angrily requested his attendant not to jest with one of the best feelings
      of our nature; to which Sam replied, &lsquo;That he wouldn&rsquo;t, if he was aware on
      it; but there were so many on &lsquo;em, that he hardly know&rsquo;d which was the
      best ones wen he heerd &lsquo;em mentioned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle then recounted what had passed between himself and Mr. Ben
      Allen, relative to Arabella; stated that his object was to gain an
      interview with the young lady, and make a formal disclosure of his
      passion; and declared his conviction, founded on certain dark hints and
      mutterings of the aforesaid Ben, that, wherever she was at present
      immured, it was somewhere near the Downs. And this was his whole stock of
      knowledge or suspicion on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this very slight clue to guide him, it was determined that Mr. Weller
      should start next morning on an expedition of discovery; it was also
      arranged that Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Winkle, who were less confident of
      their powers, should parade the town meanwhile, and accidentally drop in
      upon Mr. Bob Sawyer in the course of the day, in the hope of seeing or
      hearing something of the young lady&rsquo;s whereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, next morning, Sam Weller issued forth upon his quest, in no
      way daunted by the very discouraging prospect before him; and away he
      walked, up one street and down another&mdash;we were going to say, up one
      hill and down another, only it&rsquo;s all uphill at Clifton&mdash;without
      meeting with anything or anybody that tended to throw the faintest light
      on the matter in hand. Many were the colloquies into which Sam entered
      with grooms who were airing horses on roads, and nursemaids who were
      airing children in lanes; but nothing could Sam elicit from either the
      first-mentioned or the last, which bore the slightest reference to the
      object of his artfully-prosecuted inquiries. There were a great many young
      ladies in a great many houses, the greater part whereof were shrewdly
      suspected by the male and female domestics to be deeply attached to
      somebody, or perfectly ready to become so, if opportunity afforded. But as
      none among these young ladies was Miss Arabella Allen, the information
      left Sam at exactly the old point of wisdom at which he had stood before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam struggled across the Downs against a good high wind, wondering whether
      it was always necessary to hold your hat on with both hands in that part
      of the country, and came to a shady by-place, about which were sprinkled
      several little villas of quiet and secluded appearance. Outside a stable
      door at the bottom of a long back lane without a thoroughfare, a groom in
      undress was idling about, apparently persuading himself that he was doing
      something with a spade and a wheel-barrow. We may remark, in this place,
      that we have scarcely ever seen a groom near a stable, in his lazy
      moments, who has not been, to a greater or less extent, the victim of this
      singular delusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam thought he might as well talk to this groom as to any one else,
      especially as he was very tired with walking, and there was a good large
      stone just opposite the wheel-barrow; so he strolled down the lane, and,
      seating himself on the stone, opened a conversation with the ease and
      freedom for which he was remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mornin&rsquo;, old friend,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arternoon, you mean,&rsquo; replied the groom, casting a surly look at Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re wery right, old friend,&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;I <i>do</i> mean arternoon.
      How are you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t find myself much the better for seeing of you,&rsquo; replied the
      ill-tempered groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s wery odd&mdash;that is,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;for you look so uncommon
      cheerful, and seem altogether so lively, that it does vun&rsquo;s heart good to
      see you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The surly groom looked surlier still at this, but not sufficiently so to
      produce any effect upon Sam, who immediately inquired, with a countenance
      of great anxiety, whether his master&rsquo;s name was not Walker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor Brown, I s&rsquo;pose?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor Vilson?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; nor that either,&rsquo; said the groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell,&rsquo; replied Sam, &lsquo;then I&rsquo;m mistaken, and he hasn&rsquo;t got the honour o&rsquo; 
      my acquaintance, which I thought he had. Don&rsquo;t wait here out o&rsquo; compliment
      to me,&rsquo; said Sam, as the groom wheeled in the barrow, and prepared to shut
      the gate. &lsquo;Ease afore ceremony, old boy; I&rsquo;ll excuse you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d knock your head off for half-a-crown,&rsquo; said the surly groom, bolting
      one half of the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t afford to have it done on those terms,&rsquo; rejoined Sam. &lsquo;It &lsquo;ud be
      worth a life&rsquo;s board wages at least, to you, and &lsquo;ud be cheap at that.
      Make my compliments indoors. Tell &lsquo;em not to vait dinner for me, and say
      they needn&rsquo;t mind puttin&rsquo; any by, for it&rsquo;ll be cold afore I come in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply to this, the groom waxing very wroth, muttered a desire to damage
      somebody&rsquo;s person; but disappeared without carrying it into execution,
      slamming the door angrily after him, and wholly unheeding Sam&rsquo;s
      affectionate request, that he would leave him a lock of his hair before he
      went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam continued to sit on the large stone, meditating upon what was best to
      be done, and revolving in his mind a plan for knocking at all the doors
      within five miles of Bristol, taking them at a hundred and fifty or two
      hundred a day, and endeavouring to find Miss Arabella by that expedient,
      when accident all of a sudden threw in his way what he might have sat
      there for a twelvemonth and yet not found without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the lane where he sat, there opened three or four garden gates,
      belonging to as many houses, which though detached from each other, were
      only separated by their gardens. As these were large and long, and well
      planted with trees, the houses were not only at some distance off, but the
      greater part of them were nearly concealed from view. Sam was sitting with
      his eyes fixed upon the dust-heap outside the next gate to that by which
      the groom had disappeared, profoundly turning over in his mind the
      difficulties of his present undertaking, when the gate opened, and a
      female servant came out into the lane to shake some bedside carpets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam was so very busy with his own thoughts, that it is probable he would
      have taken no more notice of the young woman than just raising his head
      and remarking that she had a very neat and pretty figure, if his feelings
      of gallantry had not been most strongly roused by observing that she had
      no one to help her, and that the carpets seemed too heavy for her single
      strength. Mr. Weller was a gentleman of great gallantry in his own way,
      and he no sooner remarked this circumstance than he hastily rose from the
      large stone, and advanced towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Sam, sliding up with an air of great respect, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll
      spile that wery pretty figure out o&rsquo; all perportion if you shake them
      carpets by yourself. Let me help you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady, who had been coyly affecting not to know that a gentleman
      was so near, turned round as Sam spoke&mdash;no doubt (indeed she said so,
      afterwards) to decline this offer from a perfect stranger&mdash;when
      instead of speaking, she started back, and uttered a half-suppressed
      scream. Sam was scarcely less staggered, for in the countenance of the
      well-shaped female servant, he beheld the very features of his valentine,
      the pretty housemaid from Mr. Nupkins&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wy, Mary, my dear!&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lauk, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;how you do frighten one!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam made no verbal answer to this complaint, nor can we precisely say what
      reply he did make. We merely know that after a short pause Mary said,
      &lsquo;Lor, do adun, Mr. Weller!&rsquo; and that his hat had fallen off a few moments
      before&mdash;from both of which tokens we should be disposed to infer that
      one kiss, or more, had passed between the parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, how did you come here?&rsquo; said Mary, when the conversation to which
      this interruption had been offered, was resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O&rsquo; course I came to look arter you, my darlin&rsquo;,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; for
      once permitting his passion to get the better of his veracity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how did you know I was here?&rsquo; inquired Mary. &lsquo;Who could have told you
      that I took another service at Ipswich, and that they afterwards moved all
      the way here? Who <i>could </i>have told you that, Mr. Weller?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, to be sure,&rsquo; said Sam, with a cunning look, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the pint. Who
      could ha&rsquo; told me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Mr. Muzzle, was it?&rsquo; inquired Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no.&rsquo; replied Sam, with a solemn shake of the head, &lsquo;it warn&rsquo;t him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must have been the cook,&rsquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O&rsquo; course it must,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I never heard the like of that!&rsquo; exclaimed Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more did I,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;But Mary, my dear&rsquo;&mdash;here Sam&rsquo;s manner
      grew extremely affectionate&mdash;&lsquo;Mary, my dear, I&rsquo;ve got another affair
      in hand as is wery pressin&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; my governor&rsquo;s friends&mdash;Mr.
      Winkle, you remember him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Him in the green coat?&rsquo; said Mary. &lsquo;Oh, yes, I remember him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s in a horrid state o&rsquo; love; reg&rsquo;larly comfoozled,
      and done over vith it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor!&rsquo; interposed Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;but that&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; if we could find out the young
      &lsquo;ooman;&rsquo; and here Sam, with many digressions upon the personal beauty of
      Mary, and the unspeakable tortures he had experienced since he last saw
      her, gave a faithful account of Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s present predicament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;I never did!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O&rsquo; course not,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;and nobody never did, nor never vill neither;
      and here am I a-walkin&rsquo; about like the wandering Jew&mdash;a sportin&rsquo; 
      character you have perhaps heerd on Mary, my dear, as vos alvays doin&rsquo; a
      match agin&rsquo; time, and never vent to sleep&mdash;looking arter this here
      Miss Arabella Allen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss who?&rsquo; said Mary, in great astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Arabella Allen,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goodness gracious!&rsquo; said Mary, pointing to the garden door which the
      sulky groom had locked after him. &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s that very house; she&rsquo;s been
      living there these six weeks. Their upper house-maid, which is lady&rsquo;s-maid
      too, told me all about it over the wash-house palin&rsquo;s before the family
      was out of bed, one mornin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot, the wery next door to you?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The very next,&rsquo; replied Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller was so deeply overcome on receiving this intelligence that he
      found it absolutely necessary to cling to his fair informant for support;
      and divers little love passages had passed between them, before he was
      sufficiently collected to return to the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell,&rsquo; said Sam at length, &lsquo;if this don&rsquo;t beat cock-fightin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; 
      never vill, as the lord mayor said, ven the chief secretary o&rsquo; state
      proposed his missis&rsquo;s health arter dinner. That wery next house! Wy, I&rsquo;ve
      got a message to her as I&rsquo;ve been a-trying all day to deliver.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;but you can&rsquo;t deliver it now, because she only walks in
      the garden in the evening, and then only for a very little time; she never
      goes out, without the old lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam ruminated for a few moments, and finally hit upon the following plan
      of operations; that he should return just at dusk&mdash;the time at which
      Arabella invariably took her walk&mdash;and, being admitted by Mary into
      the garden of the house to which she belonged, would contrive to scramble
      up the wall, beneath the overhanging boughs of a large pear-tree, which
      would effectually screen him from observation; would there deliver his
      message, and arrange, if possible, an interview on behalf of Mr. Winkle
      for the ensuing evening at the same hour. Having made this arrangement
      with great despatch, he assisted Mary in the long-deferred occupation of
      shaking the carpets.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not half as innocent a thing as it looks, that shaking little pieces
      of carpet&mdash;at least, there may be no great harm in the shaking, but
      the folding is a very insidious process. So long as the shaking lasts, and
      the two parties are kept the carpet&rsquo;s length apart, it is as innocent an
      amusement as can well be devised; but when the folding begins, and the
      distance between them gets gradually lessened from one half its former
      length to a quarter, and then to an eighth, and then to a sixteenth, and
      then to a thirty-second, if the carpet be long enough, it becomes
      dangerous. We do not know, to a nicety, how many pieces of carpet were
      folded in this instance, but we can venture to state that as many pieces
      as there were, so many times did Sam kiss the pretty housemaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller regaled himself with moderation at the nearest tavern until it
      was nearly dusk, and then returned to the lane without the thoroughfare.
      Having been admitted into the garden by Mary, and having received from
      that lady sundry admonitions concerning the safety of his limbs and neck,
      Sam mounted into the pear-tree, to wait until Arabella should come into
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited so long without this anxiously-expected event occurring, that he
      began to think it was not going to take place at all, when he heard light
      footsteps upon the gravel, and immediately afterwards beheld Arabella
      walking pensively down the garden. As soon as she came nearly below the
      tree, Sam began, by way of gently indicating his presence, to make sundry
      diabolical noises similar to those which would probably be natural to a
      person of middle age who had been afflicted with a combination of
      inflammatory sore throat, croup, and whooping-cough, from his earliest
      infancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, the young lady cast a hurried glance towards the spot whence
      the dreadful sounds proceeded; and her previous alarm being not at all
      diminished when she saw a man among the branches, she would most certainly
      have decamped, and alarmed the house, had not fear fortunately deprived
      her of the power of moving, and caused her to sink down on a garden seat,
      which happened by good luck to be near at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a-goin&rsquo; off,&rsquo; soliloquised Sam in great perplexity. &lsquo;Wot a thing it
      is, as these here young creeturs will go a-faintin&rsquo; avay just ven they
      oughtn&rsquo;t to. Here, young &lsquo;ooman, Miss Sawbones, Mrs. Vinkle, don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it was the magic of Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s name, or the coolness of the open
      air, or some recollection of Mr. Weller&rsquo;s voice, that revived Arabella,
      matters not. She raised her head and languidly inquired, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that, and
      what do you want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush,&rsquo; said Sam, swinging himself on to the wall, and crouching there in
      as small a compass as he could reduce himself to, &lsquo;only me, miss, only
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s servant!&rsquo; said Arabella earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wery same, miss,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s Mr. Vinkle reg&rsquo;larly sewed up
      vith desperation, miss.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Arabella, drawing nearer the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, indeed,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;Ve thought ve should ha&rsquo; been obliged to
      strait-veskit him last night; he&rsquo;s been a-ravin&rsquo; all day; and he says if
      he can&rsquo;t see you afore to-morrow night&rsquo;s over, he vishes he may be
      somethin&rsquo; unpleasanted if he don&rsquo;t drownd hisself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no, no, Mr. Weller!&rsquo; said Arabella, clasping her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s wot he says, miss,&rsquo; replied Sam coolly. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a man of his word,
      and it&rsquo;s my opinion he&rsquo;ll do it, miss. He&rsquo;s heerd all about you from the
      sawbones in barnacles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From my brother!&rsquo; said Arabella, having some faint recognition of Sam&rsquo;s
      description.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know which is your brother, miss,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;Is it
      the dirtiest vun o&rsquo; the two?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; returned Arabella, &lsquo;go on. Make haste, pray.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, miss,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s heerd all about it from him; and it&rsquo;s the
      gov&rsquo;nor&rsquo;s opinion that if you don&rsquo;t see him wery quick, the sawbones as
      we&rsquo;ve been a-speakin&rsquo; on, &lsquo;ull get as much extra lead in his head as&rsquo;ll
      rayther damage the dewelopment o&rsquo; the orgins if they ever put it in
      spirits artervards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, what can I do to prevent these dreadful quarrels!&rsquo; exclaimed
      Arabella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the suspicion of a priory &lsquo;tachment as is the cause of it all,&rsquo; 
      replied Sam. &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better see him, miss.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how?&mdash;where?&rsquo; cried Arabella. &lsquo;I dare not leave the house alone.
      My brother is so unkind, so unreasonable! I know how strange my talking
      thus to you may appear, Mr. Weller, but I am very, very unhappy&mdash;&rsquo; 
      and here poor Arabella wept so bitterly that Sam grew chivalrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may seem wery strange talkin&rsquo; to me about these here affairs, miss,&rsquo; 
      said Sam, with great vehemence; &lsquo;but all I can say is, that I&rsquo;m not only
      ready but villin&rsquo; to do anythin&rsquo; as&rsquo;ll make matters agreeable; and if
      chuckin&rsquo; either o&rsquo; them sawboneses out o&rsquo; winder &lsquo;ull do it, I&rsquo;m the man.&rsquo; 
      As Sam Weller said this, he tucked up his wristbands, at the imminent
      hazard of falling off the wall in so doing, to intimate his readiness to
      set to work immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flattering as these professions of good feeling were, Arabella resolutely
      declined (most unaccountably, as Sam thought) to avail herself of them.
      For some time she strenuously refused to grant Mr. Winkle the interview
      Sam had so pathetically requested; but at length, when the conversation
      threatened to be interrupted by the unwelcome arrival of a third party,
      she hurriedly gave him to understand, with many professions of gratitude,
      that it was barely possible she might be in the garden an hour later, next
      evening. Sam understood this perfectly well; and Arabella, bestowing upon
      him one of her sweetest smiles, tripped gracefully away, leaving Mr.
      Weller in a state of very great admiration of her charms, both personal
      and mental.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having descended in safety from the wall, and not forgotten to devote a
      few moments to his own particular business in the same department, Mr.
      Weller then made the best of his way back to the Bush, where his prolonged
      absence had occasioned much speculation and some alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must be careful,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, after listening attentively to
      Sam&rsquo;s tale, &lsquo;not for our sakes, but for that of the young lady. We must be
      very cautious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>We</i>!&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, with marked emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s momentary look of indignation at the tone of this remark,
      subsided into his characteristic expression of benevolence, as he replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>We</i>, Sir! I shall accompany you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You!&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick mildly. &lsquo;In affording you this interview, the
      young lady has taken a natural, perhaps, but still a very imprudent step.
      If I am present at the meeting&mdash;a mutual friend, who is old enough to
      be the father of both parties&mdash;the voice of calumny can never be
      raised against her hereafter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s eyes lightened with honest exultation at his own foresight,
      as he spoke thus. Mr. Winkle was touched by this little trait of his
      delicate respect for the young <i>protegee </i>of his friend, and took his
      hand with a feeling of regard, akin to veneration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You <i>SHALL </i> go,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Sam, have my greatcoat and shawl ready, and
      order a conveyance to be at the door to-morrow evening, rather earlier
      than is absolutely necessary, in order that we may be in good time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller touched his hat, as an earnest of his obedience, and withdrew
      to make all needful preparations for the expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coach was punctual to the time appointed; and Mr. Weller, after duly
      installing Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Winkle inside, took his seat on the box by
      the driver. They alighted, as had been agreed on, about a quarter of a
      mile from the place of rendezvous, and desiring the coachman to await
      their return, proceeded the remaining distance on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this stage of the undertaking that Mr. Pickwick, with many
      smiles and various other indications of great self-satisfaction, produced
      from one of his coat pockets a dark lantern, with which he had specially
      provided himself for the occasion, and the great mechanical beauty of
      which he proceeded to explain to Mr. Winkle, as they walked along, to the
      no small surprise of the few stragglers they met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have been the better for something of this kind, in my last
      garden expedition, at night; eh, Sam?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking
      good-humouredly round at his follower, who was trudging behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery nice things, if they&rsquo;re managed properly, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller;
      &lsquo;but wen you don&rsquo;t want to be seen, I think they&rsquo;re more useful arter the
      candle&rsquo;s gone out, than wen it&rsquo;s alight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick appeared struck by Sam&rsquo;s remarks, for he put the lantern into
      his pocket again, and they walked on in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Down here, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;Let me lead the way. This is the lane, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the lane they went, and dark enough it was. Mr. Pickwick brought out
      the lantern, once or twice, as they groped their way along, and threw a
      very brilliant little tunnel of light before them, about a foot in
      diameter. It was very pretty to look at, but seemed to have the effect of
      rendering surrounding objects rather darker than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they arrived at the large stone. Here Sam recommended his master
      and Mr. Winkle to seat themselves, while he reconnoitred, and ascertained
      whether Mary was yet in waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an absence of five or ten minutes, Sam returned to say that the gate
      was opened, and all quiet. Following him with stealthy tread, Mr. Pickwick
      and Mr. Winkle soon found themselves in the garden. Here everybody said,
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; a good many times; and that being done, no one seemed to have any
      very distinct apprehension of what was to be done next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Miss Allen in the garden yet, Mary?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Winkle, much
      agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rsquo; replied the pretty housemaid. &lsquo;The best thing to be
      done, sir, will be for Mr. Weller to give you a hoist up into the tree,
      and perhaps Mr. Pickwick will have the goodness to see that nobody comes
      up the lane, while I watch at the other end of the garden. Goodness
      gracious, what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That &lsquo;ere blessed lantern &lsquo;ull be the death on us all,&rsquo; exclaimed Sam
      peevishly. &lsquo;Take care wot you&rsquo;re a-doin&rsquo; on, sir; you&rsquo;re a-sendin&rsquo; a blaze
      o&rsquo; light, right into the back parlour winder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, turning hastily aside, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to do
      that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, it&rsquo;s in the next house, sir,&rsquo; remonstrated Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless my heart!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, turning round again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, it&rsquo;s in the stable, and they&rsquo;ll think the place is afire,&rsquo; said Sam.
      &lsquo;Shut it up, sir, can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the most extraordinary lantern I ever met with, in all my life!&rsquo; 
      exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, greatly bewildered by the effects he had so
      unintentionally produced. &lsquo;I never saw such a powerful reflector.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be vun too powerful for us, if you keep blazin&rsquo; avay in that
      manner, sir,&rsquo; replied Sam, as Mr. Pickwick, after various unsuccessful
      efforts, managed to close the slide. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the young lady&rsquo;s footsteps.
      Now, Mr. Winkle, sir, up vith you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop, stop!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I must speak to her first. Help me up,
      Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gently, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam, planting his head against the wall, and making a
      platform of his back. &lsquo;Step atop o&rsquo; that &lsquo;ere flower-pot, Sir. Now then,
      up vith you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I shall hurt you, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind me, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;Lend him a hand, Mr. Winkle, sir.
      Steady, sir, steady! That&rsquo;s the time o&rsquo; day!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Sam spoke, Mr. Pickwick, by exertions almost supernatural in a
      gentleman of his years and weight, contrived to get upon Sam&rsquo;s back; and
      Sam gently raising himself up, and Mr. Pickwick holding on fast by the top
      of the wall, while Mr. Winkle clasped him tight by the legs, they
      contrived by these means to bring his spectacles just above the level of
      the coping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking over the wall, and catching sight of
      Arabella, on the other side, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be frightened, my dear, it&rsquo;s only me.&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Oh, pray go away, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Arabella. &lsquo;Tell them all to go
      away. I am so dreadfully frightened. Dear, dear Mr. Pickwick, don&rsquo;t stop
      there. You&rsquo;ll fall down and kill yourself, I know you will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, pray don&rsquo;t alarm yourself, my dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick soothingly.
      &lsquo;There is not the least cause for fear, I assure you. Stand firm, Sam,&rsquo; 
      said Mr. Pickwick, looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be longer than you can
      conweniently help, sir. You&rsquo;re rayther heavy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only another moment, Sam,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I merely wished you to know, my dear, that I should not have allowed my
      young friend to see you in this clandestine way, if the situation in which
      you are placed had left him any alternative; and, lest the impropriety of
      this step should cause you any uneasiness, my love, it may be a
      satisfaction to you, to know that I am present. That&rsquo;s all, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, Mr. Pickwick, I am very much obliged to you for your kindness and
      consideration,&rsquo; replied Arabella, drying her tears with her handkerchief.
      She would probably have said much more, had not Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s head
      disappeared with great swiftness, in consequence of a false step on Sam&rsquo;s
      shoulder which brought him suddenly to the ground. He was up again in an
      instant however; and bidding Mr. Winkle make haste and get the interview
      over, ran out into the lane to keep watch, with all the courage and ardour
      of youth. Mr. Winkle himself, inspired by the occasion, was on the wall in
      a moment, merely pausing to request Sam to be careful of his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take care on him, sir,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;Leave him to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is he? What&rsquo;s he doing, Sam?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless his old gaiters,&rsquo; rejoined Sam, looking out at the garden door.
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a-keepin&rsquo; guard in the lane vith that &lsquo;ere dark lantern, like a
      amiable Guy Fawkes! I never see such a fine creetur in my days. Blessed if
      I don&rsquo;t think his heart must ha&rsquo; been born five-and-twenty year arter his
      body, at least!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle stayed not to hear the encomium upon his friend. He had dropped
      from the wall; thrown himself at Arabella&rsquo;s feet; and by this time was
      pleading the sincerity of his passion with an eloquence worthy even of Mr.
      Pickwick himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these things were going on in the open air, an elderly gentleman of
      scientific attainments was seated in his library, two or three houses off,
      writing a philosophical treatise, and ever and anon moistening his clay
      and his labours with a glass of claret from a venerable-looking bottle
      which stood by his side. In the agonies of composition, the elderly
      gentleman looked sometimes at the carpet, sometimes at the ceiling, and
      sometimes at the wall; and when neither carpet, ceiling, nor wall afforded
      the requisite degree of inspiration, he looked out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of these pauses of invention, the scientific gentleman was gazing
      abstractedly on the thick darkness outside, when he was very much
      surprised by observing a most brilliant light glide through the air, at a
      short distance above the ground, and almost instantaneously vanish. After
      a short time the phenomenon was repeated, not once or twice, but several
      times; at last the scientific gentleman, laying down his pen, began to
      consider to what natural causes these appearances were to be assigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not meteors; they were too low. They were not glow-worms; they
      were too high. They were not will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps; they were not fireflies;
      they were not fireworks. What could they be? Some extraordinary and
      wonderful phenomenon of nature, which no philosopher had ever seen before;
      something which it had been reserved for him alone to discover, and which
      he should immortalise his name by chronicling for the benefit of
      posterity. Full of this idea, the scientific gentleman seized his pen
      again, and committed to paper sundry notes of these unparalleled
      appearances, with the date, day, hour, minute, and precise second at which
      they were visible: all of which were to form the data of a voluminous
      treatise of great research and deep learning, which should astonish all
      the atmospherical wiseacres that ever drew breath in any part of the
      civilised globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself back in his easy-chair, wrapped in contemplations of his
      future greatness. The mysterious light appeared more brilliantly than
      before, dancing, to all appearance, up and down the lane, crossing from
      side to side, and moving in an orbit as eccentric as comets themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scientific gentleman was a bachelor. He had no wife to call in and
      astonish, so he rang the bell for his servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pruffle,&rsquo; said the scientific gentleman, &lsquo;there is something very
      extraordinary in the air to-night? Did you see that?&rsquo; said the scientific
      gentleman, pointing out of the window, as the light again became visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I did, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think of it, Pruffle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think of it, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. You have been bred up in this country. What should you say was the
      cause for those lights, now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The scientific gentleman smilingly anticipated Pruffle&rsquo;s reply that he
      could assign no cause for them at all. Pruffle meditated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should say it was thieves, Sir,&rsquo; said Pruffle at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a fool, and may go downstairs,&rsquo; said the scientific gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, Sir,&rsquo; said Pruffle. And down he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the scientific gentleman could not rest under the idea of the
      ingenious treatise he had projected being lost to the world, which must
      inevitably be the case if the speculation of the ingenious Mr. Pruffle
      were not stifled in its birth. He put on his hat and walked quickly down
      the garden, determined to investigate the matter to the very bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, shortly before the scientific gentleman walked out into the garden,
      Mr. Pickwick had run down the lane as fast as he could, to convey a false
      alarm that somebody was coming that way; occasionally drawing back the
      slide of the dark lantern to keep himself from the ditch. The alarm was no
      sooner given, than Mr. Winkle scrambled back over the wall, and Arabella
      ran into the house; the garden gate was shut, and the three adventurers
      were making the best of their way down the lane, when they were startled
      by the scientific gentleman unlocking his garden gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold hard,&rsquo; whispered Sam, who was, of course, the first of the party.
      &lsquo;Show a light for just vun second, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick did as he was desired, and Sam, seeing a man&rsquo;s head peeping
      out very cautiously within half a yard of his own, gave it a gentle tap
      with his clenched fist, which knocked it, with a hollow sound, against the
      gate. Having performed this feat with great suddenness and dexterity, Mr.
      Weller caught Mr. Pickwick up on his back, and followed Mr. Winkle down
      the lane at a pace which, considering the burden he carried, was perfectly
      astonishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you got your vind back agin, Sir,&rsquo; inquired Sam, when they had
      reached the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite. Quite, now,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then come along, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam, setting his master on his feet again.
      &lsquo;Come betveen us, sir. Not half a mile to run. Think you&rsquo;re vinnin&rsquo; a cup,
      sir. Now for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus encouraged, Mr. Pickwick made the very best use of his legs. It may
      be confidently stated that a pair of black gaiters never got over the
      ground in better style than did those of Mr. Pickwick on this memorable
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coach was waiting, the horses were fresh, the roads were good, and the
      driver was willing. The whole party arrived in safety at the Bush before
      Mr. Pickwick had recovered his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In with you at once, sir,&rsquo; said Sam, as he helped his master out. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
      stop a second in the street, arter that &lsquo;ere exercise. Beg your pardon,
      sir,&rsquo; continued Sam, touching his hat as Mr. Winkle descended, &lsquo;hope there
      warn&rsquo;t a priory &lsquo;tachment, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle grasped his humble friend by the hand, and whispered in his
      ear, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Sam; quite right.&rsquo; Upon which Mr. Weller struck
      three distinct blows upon his nose in token of intelligence, smiled,
      winked, and proceeded to put the steps up, with a countenance expressive
      of lively satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the scientific gentleman, he demonstrated, in a masterly treatise,
      that these wonderful lights were the effect of electricity; and clearly
      proved the same by detailing how a flash of fire danced before his eyes
      when he put his head out of the gate, and how he received a shock which
      stunned him for a quarter of an hour afterwards; which demonstration
      delighted all the scientific associations beyond measure, and caused him
      to be considered a light of science ever afterwards.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL. INTRODUCES MR. PICKWICK TO A NEW AND NOT UNINTERESTING SCENE
      IN THE GREAT DRAMA OF LIFE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he remainder of
      the period which Mr. Pickwick had assigned as the duration of the stay at
      Bath passed over without the occurrence of anything material. Trinity term
      commenced. On the expiration of its first week, Mr. Pickwick and his
      friends returned to London; and the former gentleman, attended of course
      by Sam, straightway repaired to his old quarters at the George and
      Vulture.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third morning after their arrival, just as all the clocks in the
      city were striking nine individually, and somewhere about nine hundred and
      ninety-nine collectively, Sam was taking the air in George Yard, when a
      queer sort of fresh-painted vehicle drove up, out of which there jumped
      with great agility, throwing the reins to a stout man who sat beside him,
      a queer sort of gentleman, who seemed made for the vehicle, and the
      vehicle for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vehicle was not exactly a gig, neither was it a stanhope. It was not
      what is currently denominated a dog-cart, neither was it a taxed cart, nor
      a chaise-cart, nor a guillotined cabriolet; and yet it had something of
      the character of each and every of these machines. It was painted a bright
      yellow, with the shafts and wheels picked out in black; and the driver sat
      in the orthodox sporting style, on cushions piled about two feet above the
      rail. The horse was a bay, a well-looking animal enough; but with
      something of a flash and dog-fighting air about him, nevertheless, which
      accorded both with the vehicle and his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master himself was a man of about forty, with black hair, and
      carefully combed whiskers. He was dressed in a particularly gorgeous
      manner, with plenty of articles of jewellery about him&mdash;all about
      three sizes larger than those which are usually worn by gentlemen&mdash;and
      a rough greatcoat to crown the whole. Into one pocket of this greatcoat,
      he thrust his left hand the moment he dismounted, while from the other he
      drew forth, with his right, a very bright and glaring silk handkerchief,
      with which he whisked a speck or two of dust from his boots, and then,
      crumpling it in his hand, swaggered up the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had not escaped Sam&rsquo;s attention that, when this person dismounted, a
      shabby-looking man in a brown greatcoat shorn of divers buttons, who had
      been previously slinking about, on the opposite side of the way, crossed
      over, and remained stationary close by. Having something more than a
      suspicion of the object of the gentleman&rsquo;s visit, Sam preceded him to the
      George and Vulture, and, turning sharp round, planted himself in the
      centre of the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, my fine fellow!&rsquo; said the man in the rough coat, in an imperious
      tone, attempting at the same time to push his way past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Sir, wot&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; replied Sam, returning the push with
      compound interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, none of this, my man; this won&rsquo;t do with me,&rsquo; said the owner of the
      rough coat, raising his voice, and turning white. &lsquo;Here, Smouch!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, wot&rsquo;s amiss here?&rsquo; growled the man in the brown coat, who had been
      gradually sneaking up the court during this short dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only some insolence of this young man&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said the principal, giving Sam
      another push.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, none o&rsquo; this gammon,&rsquo; growled Smouch, giving him another, and a
      harder one.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last push had the effect which it was intended by the experienced Mr.
      Smouch to produce; for while Sam, anxious to return the compliment, was
      grinding that gentleman&rsquo;s body against the door-post, the principal crept
      past, and made his way to the bar, whither Sam, after bandying a few
      epithetical remarks with Mr. Smouch, followed at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-morning, my dear,&rsquo; said the principal, addressing the young lady at
      the bar, with Botany Bay ease, and New South Wales gentility; &lsquo;which is
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s room, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Show him up,&rsquo; said the barmaid to a waiter, without deigning another look
      at the exquisite, in reply to his inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter led the way upstairs as he was desired, and the man in the
      rough coat followed, with Sam behind him, who, in his progress up the
      staircase, indulged in sundry gestures indicative of supreme contempt and
      defiance, to the unspeakable gratification of the servants and other
      lookers-on. Mr. Smouch, who was troubled with a hoarse cough, remained
      below, and expectorated in the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was fast asleep in bed, when his early visitor, followed by
      Sam, entered the room. The noise they made, in so doing, awoke him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shaving-water, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, from within the curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shave you directly, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said the visitor, drawing one of them
      back from the bed&rsquo;s head. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got an execution against you, at the suit
      of Bardell.&mdash;Here&rsquo;s the warrant.&mdash;Common Pleas.&mdash;Here&rsquo;s my
      card. I suppose you&rsquo;ll come over to my house.&rsquo; Giving Mr. Pickwick a
      friendly tap on the shoulder, the sheriff&rsquo;s officer (for such he was)
      threw his card on the counterpane, and pulled a gold toothpick from his
      waistcoat pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Namby&rsquo;s the name,&rsquo; said the sheriff&rsquo;s deputy, as Mr. Pickwick took his
      spectacles from under the pillow, and put them on, to read the card.
      &lsquo;Namby, Bell Alley, Coleman Street.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, Sam Weller, who had had his eyes fixed hitherto on Mr.
      Namby&rsquo;s shining beaver, interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you a Quaker?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know I am, before I&rsquo;ve done with you,&rsquo; replied the indignant
      officer. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you manners, my fine fellow, one of these fine
      mornings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do the same to you. Take your hat off.&rsquo; With
      this, Mr. Weller, in the most dexterous manner, knocked Mr. Namby&rsquo;s hat to
      the other side of the room, with such violence, that he had very nearly
      caused him to swallow the gold toothpick into the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Observe this, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said the disconcerted officer, gasping for
      breath. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been assaulted in the execution of my dooty by your servant
      in your chamber. I&rsquo;m in bodily fear. I call you to witness this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t witness nothin&rsquo;, Sir,&rsquo; interposed Sam. &lsquo;Shut your eyes up tight,
      Sir. I&rsquo;d pitch him out o&rsquo; winder, only he couldn&rsquo;t fall far enough, &lsquo;cause
      o&rsquo; the leads outside.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, in an angry voice, as his attendant made various
      demonstrations of hostilities, &lsquo;if you say another word, or offer the
      slightest interference with this person, I discharge you that instant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Sir!&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your tongue,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Take that hat up again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But this Sam flatly and positively refused to do; and, after he had been
      severely reprimanded by his master, the officer, being in a hurry,
      condescended to pick it up himself, venting a great variety of threats
      against Sam meanwhile, which that gentleman received with perfect
      composure, merely observing that if Mr. Namby would have the goodness to
      put his hat on again, he would knock it into the latter end of next week.
      Mr. Namby, perhaps thinking that such a process might be productive of
      inconvenience to himself, declined to offer the temptation, and, soon
      after, called up Smouch. Having informed him that the capture was made,
      and that he was to wait for the prisoner until he should have finished
      dressing, Namby then swaggered out, and drove away. Smouch, requesting Mr.
      Pickwick in a surly manner &lsquo;to be as alive as he could, for it was a busy
      time,&rsquo; drew up a chair by the door and sat there, until he had finished
      dressing. Sam was then despatched for a hackney-coach, and in it the
      triumvirate proceeded to Coleman Street. It was fortunate the distance was
      short; for Mr. Smouch, besides possessing no very enchanting
      conversational powers, was rendered a decidedly unpleasant companion in a
      limited space, by the physical weakness to which we have elsewhere
      adverted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coach having turned into a very narrow and dark street, stopped before
      a house with iron bars to all the windows; the door-posts of which were
      graced by the name and title of &lsquo;Namby, Officer to the Sheriffs of
      London&rsquo;; the inner gate having been opened by a gentleman who might have
      passed for a neglected twin-brother of Mr. Smouch, and who was endowed
      with a large key for the purpose, Mr. Pickwick was shown into the
      &lsquo;coffee-room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This coffee-room was a front parlour, the principal features of which were
      fresh sand and stale tobacco smoke. Mr. Pickwick bowed to the three
      persons who were seated in it when he entered; and having despatched Sam
      for Perker, withdrew into an obscure corner, and looked thence with some
      curiosity upon his new companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these was a mere boy of nineteen or twenty, who, though it was yet
      barely ten o&rsquo;clock, was drinking gin-and-water, and smoking a cigar&mdash;amusements
      to which, judging from his inflamed countenance, he had devoted himself
      pretty constantly for the last year or two of his life. Opposite him,
      engaged in stirring the fire with the toe of his right boot, was a coarse,
      vulgar young man of about thirty, with a sallow face and harsh voice;
      evidently possessed of that knowledge of the world, and captivating
      freedom of manner, which is to be acquired in public-house parlours, and
      at low billiard tables. The third tenant of the apartment was a
      middle-aged man in a very old suit of black, who looked pale and haggard,
      and paced up and down the room incessantly; stopping, now and then, to
      look with great anxiety out of the window as if he expected somebody, and
      then resuming his walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better have the loan of my razor this morning, Mr. Ayresleigh,&rsquo; 
      said the man who was stirring the fire, tipping the wink to his friend the
      boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, no, I shan&rsquo;t want it; I expect I shall be out, in the course
      of an hour or so,&rsquo; replied the other in a hurried manner. Then, walking
      again up to the window, and once more returning disappointed, he sighed
      deeply, and left the room; upon which the other two burst into a loud
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I never saw such a game as that,&rsquo; said the gentleman who had
      offered the razor, whose name appeared to be Price. &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; Mr. Price
      confirmed the assertion with an oath, and then laughed again, when of
      course the boy (who thought his companion one of the most dashing fellows
      alive) laughed also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d hardly think, would you now,&rsquo; said Price, turning towards Mr.
      Pickwick, &lsquo;that that chap&rsquo;s been here a week yesterday, and never once
      shaved himself yet, because he feels so certain he&rsquo;s going out in half an
      hour&rsquo;s time, thinks he may as well put it off till he gets home?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor man!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Are his chances of getting out of his
      difficulties really so great?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chances be d&mdash;&mdash;d,&rsquo; replied Price; &lsquo;he hasn&rsquo;t half the ghost of
      one. I wouldn&rsquo;t give <i>that </i>for his chance of walking about the
      streets this time ten years.&rsquo; With this, Mr. Price snapped his fingers
      contemptuously, and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me a sheet of paper, Crookey,&rsquo; said Mr. Price to the attendant, who
      in dress and general appearance looked something between a bankrupt
      glazier, and a drover in a state of insolvency; &lsquo;and a glass of
      brandy-and-water, Crookey, d&rsquo;ye hear? I&rsquo;m going to write to my father, and
      I must have a stimulant, or I shan&rsquo;t be able to pitch it strong enough
      into the old boy.&rsquo; At this facetious speech, the young boy, it is almost
      needless to say, was fairly convulsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; said Mr. Price. &lsquo;Never say die. All fun, ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Prime!&rsquo; said the young gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got some spirit about you, you have,&rsquo; said Price. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve seen
      something of life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I rather think I have!&rsquo; replied the boy. He had looked at it through the
      dirty panes of glass in a bar door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick, feeling not a little disgusted with this dialogue, as well
      as with the air and manner of the two beings by whom it had been carried
      on, was about to inquire whether he could not be accommodated with a
      private sitting-room, when two or three strangers of genteel appearance
      entered, at sight of whom the boy threw his cigar into the fire, and
      whispering to Mr. Price that they had come to &lsquo;make it all right&rsquo; for him,
      joined them at a table in the farther end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would appear, however, that matters were not going to be made all right
      quite so speedily as the young gentleman anticipated; for a very long
      conversation ensued, of which Mr. Pickwick could not avoid hearing certain
      angry fragments regarding dissolute conduct, and repeated forgiveness. At
      last, there were very distinct allusions made by the oldest gentleman of
      the party to one Whitecross Street, at which the young gentleman,
      notwithstanding his primeness and his spirit, and his knowledge of life
      into the bargain, reclined his head upon the table, and howled dismally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very much satisfied with this sudden bringing down of the youth&rsquo;s valour,
      and this effectual lowering of his tone, Mr. Pickwick rang the bell, and
      was shown, at his own request, into a private room furnished with a
      carpet, table, chairs, sideboard and sofa, and ornamented with a
      looking-glass, and various old prints. Here he had the advantage of
      hearing Mrs. Namby&rsquo;s performance on a square piano overhead, while the
      breakfast was getting ready; when it came, Mr. Perker came too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha, my dear sir,&rsquo; said the little man, &lsquo;nailed at last, eh? Come, come,
      I&rsquo;m not sorry for it either, because now you&rsquo;ll see the absurdity of this
      conduct. I&rsquo;ve noted down the amount of the taxed costs and damages for
      which the ca-sa was issued, and we had better settle at once and lose no
      time. Namby is come home by this time, I dare say. What say you, my dear
      sir? Shall I draw a cheque, or will you?&rsquo; The little man rubbed his hands
      with affected cheerfulness as he said this, but glancing at Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      countenance, could not forbear at the same time casting a desponding look
      towards Sam Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perker,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;let me hear no more of this, I beg. I see no
      advantage in staying here, so I shall go to prison to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t go to Whitecross Street, my dear Sir,&rsquo; said Perker.
      &lsquo;Impossible! There are sixty beds in a ward; and the bolt&rsquo;s on, sixteen
      hours out of the four-and-twenty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would rather go to some other place of confinement if I can,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Pickwick. &lsquo;If not, I must make the best I can of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can go to the Fleet, my dear Sir, if you&rsquo;re determined to go
      somewhere,&rsquo; said Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;ll do,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go there directly I have finished
      my breakfast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop, stop, my dear Sir; not the least occasion for being in such a
      violent hurry to get into a place that most other men are as eager to get
      out of,&rsquo; said the good-natured little attorney. &lsquo;We must have a
      habeas-corpus. There&rsquo;ll be no judge at chambers till four o&rsquo;clock this
      afternoon. You must wait till then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with unmoved patience. &lsquo;Then we will have
      a chop here, at two. See about it, Sam, and tell them to be punctual.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick remaining firm, despite all the remonstrances and arguments
      of Perker, the chops appeared and disappeared in due course; he was then
      put into another hackney coach, and carried off to Chancery Lane, after
      waiting half an hour or so for Mr. Namby, who had a select dinner-party
      and could on no account be disturbed before.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two judges in attendance at Serjeant&rsquo;s Inn&mdash;one King&rsquo;s
      Bench, and one Common Pleas&mdash;and a great deal of business appeared to
      be transacting before them, if the number of lawyer&rsquo;s clerks who were
      hurrying in and out with bundles of papers, afforded any test. When they
      reached the low archway which forms the entrance to the inn, Perker was
      detained a few moments parlaying with the coachman about the fare and the
      change; and Mr. Pickwick, stepping to one side to be out of the way of the
      stream of people that were pouring in and out, looked about him with some
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people that attracted his attention most, were three or four men of
      shabby-genteel appearance, who touched their hats to many of the attorneys
      who passed, and seemed to have some business there, the nature of which
      Mr. Pickwick could not divine. They were curious-looking fellows. One was
      a slim and rather lame man in rusty black, and a white neckerchief;
      another was a stout, burly person, dressed in the same apparel, with a
      great reddish-black cloth round his neck; a third was a little weazen,
      drunken-looking body, with a pimply face. They were loitering about, with
      their hands behind them, and now and then with an anxious countenance
      whispered something in the ear of some of the gentlemen with papers, as
      they hurried by. Mr. Pickwick remembered to have very often observed them
      lounging under the archway when he had been walking past; and his
      curiosity was quite excited to know to what branch of the profession these
      dingy-looking loungers could possibly belong.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to propound the question to Namby, who kept close beside him,
      sucking a large gold ring on his little finger, when Perker bustled up,
      and observing that there was no time to lose, led the way into the inn. As
      Mr. Pickwick followed, the lame man stepped up to him, and civilly
      touching his hat, held out a written card, which Mr. Pickwick, not wishing
      to hurt the man&rsquo;s feelings by refusing, courteously accepted and deposited
      in his waistcoat pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Perker, turning round before he entered one of the offices, to
      see that his companions were close behind him. &lsquo;In here, my dear sir.
      Hallo, what do you want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This last question was addressed to the lame man, who, unobserved by Mr.
      Pickwick, made one of the party. In reply to it, the lame man touched his
      hat again, with all imaginable politeness, and motioned towards Mr.
      Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Perker, with a smile. &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want you, my dear friend,
      we don&rsquo;t want you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rsquo; said the lame man. &lsquo;The gentleman took my card.
      I hope you will employ me, sir. The gentleman nodded to me. I&rsquo;ll be judged
      by the gentleman himself. You nodded to me, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pooh, pooh, nonsense. You didn&rsquo;t nod to anybody, Pickwick? A mistake, a
      mistake,&rsquo; said Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The gentleman handed me his card,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, producing it
      from his waistcoat pocket. &lsquo;I accepted it, as the gentleman seemed to wish
      it&mdash;in fact I had some curiosity to look at it when I should be at
      leisure. I&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The little attorney burst into a loud laugh, and returning the card to the
      lame man, informing him it was all a mistake, whispered to Mr. Pickwick as
      the man turned away in dudgeon, that he was only a bail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A what!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A bail,&rsquo; replied Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A bail!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, my dear sir&mdash;half a dozen of &lsquo;em here. Bail you to any amount,
      and only charge half a crown. Curious trade, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; said Perker,
      regaling himself with a pinch of snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! Am I to understand that these men earn a livelihood by waiting
      about here, to perjure themselves before the judges of the land, at the
      rate of half a crown a crime?&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, quite aghast at the
      disclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t exactly know about perjury, my dear sir,&rsquo; replied the little
      gentleman. &lsquo;Harsh word, my dear sir, very harsh word indeed. It&rsquo;s a legal
      fiction, my dear sir, nothing more.&rsquo; Saying which, the attorney shrugged
      his shoulders, smiled, took a second pinch of snuff, and led the way into
      the office of the judge&rsquo;s clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a room of specially dirty appearance, with a very low ceiling and
      old panelled walls; and so badly lighted, that although it was broad day
      outside, great tallow candles were burning on the desks. At one end, was a
      door leading to the judge&rsquo;s private apartment, round which were
      congregated a crowd of attorneys and managing clerks, who were called in,
      in the order in which their respective appointments stood upon the file.
      Every time this door was opened to let a party out, the next party made a
      violent rush to get in; and, as in addition to the numerous dialogues
      which passed between the gentlemen who were waiting to see the judge, a
      variety of personal squabbles ensued between the greater part of those who
      had seen him, there was as much noise as could well be raised in an
      apartment of such confined dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were the conversations of these gentlemen the only sounds that broke
      upon the ear. Standing on a box behind a wooden bar at another end of the
      room was a clerk in spectacles who was &lsquo;taking the affidavits&rsquo;; large
      batches of which were, from time to time, carried into the private room by
      another clerk for the judge&rsquo;s signature. There were a large number of
      attorneys&rsquo; clerks to be sworn, and it being a moral impossibility to swear
      them all at once, the struggles of these gentlemen to reach the clerk in
      spectacles, were like those of a crowd to get in at the pit door of a
      theatre when Gracious Majesty honours it with its presence. Another
      functionary, from time to time, exercised his lungs in calling over the
      names of those who had been sworn, for the purpose of restoring to them
      their affidavits after they had been signed by the judge, which gave rise
      to a few more scuffles; and all these things going on at the same time,
      occasioned as much bustle as the most active and excitable person could
      desire to behold. There were yet another class of persons&mdash;those who
      were waiting to attend summonses their employers had taken out, which it
      was optional to the attorney on the opposite side to attend or not&mdash;and
      whose business it was, from time to time, to cry out the opposite
      attorney&rsquo;s name; to make certain that he was not in attendance without
      their knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example. Leaning against the wall, close beside the seat Mr. Pickwick
      had taken, was an office-lad of fourteen, with a tenor voice; near him a
      common-law clerk with a bass one.
    </p>
    <p>
      A clerk hurried in with a bundle of papers, and stared about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sniggle and Blink,&rsquo; cried the tenor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Porkin and Snob,&rsquo; growled the bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stumpy and Deacon,&rsquo; said the new-comer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody answered; the next man who came in, was bailed by the whole three;
      and he in his turn shouted for another firm; and then somebody else roared
      in a loud voice for another; and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time, the man in the spectacles was hard at work, swearing the
      clerks; the oath being invariably administered, without any effort at
      punctuation, and usually in the following terms:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take the book in your right hand this is your name and hand-writing you
      swear that the contents of this your affidavit are true so help you God a
      shilling you must get change I haven&rsquo;t got it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I suppose they are getting the <i>Habeas-corpus</i>
      ready?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;and I vish they&rsquo;d bring out the have-his-carcase. It&rsquo;s
      wery unpleasant keepin&rsquo; us vaitin&rsquo; here. I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; got half a dozen
      have-his-carcases ready, pack&rsquo;d up and all, by this time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What sort of cumbrous and unmanageable machine, Sam Weller imagined a
      habeas-corpus to be, does not appear; for Perker, at that moment, walked
      up and took Mr. Pickwick away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual forms having been gone through, the body of Samuel Pickwick was
      soon afterwards confided to the custody of the tipstaff, to be by him
      taken to the warden of the Fleet Prison, and there detained until the
      amount of the damages and costs in the action of Bardell against Pickwick
      was fully paid and satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, laughing, &lsquo;will be a very long time. Sam,
      call another hackney-coach. Perker, my dear friend, good-bye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall go with you, and see you safe there,&rsquo; said Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I would rather go without any other
      attendant than Sam. As soon as I get settled, I will write and let you
      know, and I shall expect you immediately. Until then, good-bye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Pickwick said this, he got into the coach which had by this time
      arrived, followed by the tipstaff. Sam having stationed himself on the
      box, it rolled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A most extraordinary man that!&rsquo; said Perker, as he stopped to pull on his
      gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a bankrupt he&rsquo;d make, Sir,&rsquo; observed Mr. Lowten, who was standing
      near. &lsquo;How he would bother the commissioners! He&rsquo;d set &lsquo;em at defiance if
      they talked of committing him, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The attorney did not appear very much delighted with his clerk&rsquo;s
      professional estimate of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s character, for he walked away
      without deigning any reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hackney-coach jolted along Fleet Street, as hackney-coaches usually
      do. The horses &lsquo;went better&rsquo;, the driver said, when they had anything
      before them (they must have gone at a most extraordinary pace when there
      was nothing), and so the vehicle kept behind a cart; when the cart
      stopped, it stopped; and when the cart went on again, it did the same. Mr.
      Pickwick sat opposite the tipstaff; and the tipstaff sat with his hat
      between his knees, whistling a tune, and looking out of the coach window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time performs wonders. By the powerful old gentleman&rsquo;s aid, even a
      hackney-coach gets over half a mile of ground. They stopped at length, and
      Mr. Pickwick alighted at the gate of the Fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tipstaff, just looking over his shoulder to see that his charge was
      following close at his heels, preceded Mr. Pickwick into the prison;
      turning to the left, after they had entered, they passed through an open
      door into a lobby, from which a heavy gate, opposite to that by which they
      had entered, and which was guarded by a stout turnkey with the key in his
      hand, led at once into the interior of the prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here they stopped, while the tipstaff delivered his papers; and here Mr.
      Pickwick was apprised that he would remain, until he had undergone the
      ceremony, known to the initiated as &lsquo;sitting for your portrait.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sitting for my portrait?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Having your likeness taken, sir,&rsquo; replied the stout turnkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;re capital hands at likenesses here. Take &lsquo;em in no time, and always
      exact. Walk in, sir, and make yourself at home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/20227m.jpg" alt="20227m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20227.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick complied with the invitation, and sat himself down; when Mr.
      Weller, who stationed himself at the back of the chair, whispered that the
      sitting was merely another term for undergoing an inspection by the
      different turnkeys, in order that they might know prisoners from visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;then I wish the artists would come. This
      is rather a public place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They von&rsquo;t be long, Sir, I des-say,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a Dutch clock,
      sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I see,&rsquo; observed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a bird-cage, sir,&rsquo; says Sam. &lsquo;Veels vithin veels, a prison in a
      prison. Ain&rsquo;t it, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Weller made this philosophical remark, Mr. Pickwick was aware that
      his sitting had commenced. The stout turnkey having been relieved from the
      lock, sat down, and looked at him carelessly, from time to time, while a
      long thin man who had relieved him, thrust his hands beneath his coat
      tails, and planting himself opposite, took a good long view of him. A
      third rather surly-looking gentleman, who had apparently been disturbed at
      his tea, for he was disposing of the last remnant of a crust and butter
      when he came in, stationed himself close to Mr. Pickwick; and, resting his
      hands on his hips, inspected him narrowly; while two others mixed with the
      group, and studied his features with most intent and thoughtful faces. Mr.
      Pickwick winced a good deal under the operation, and appeared to sit very
      uneasily in his chair; but he made no remark to anybody while it was being
      performed, not even to Sam, who reclined upon the back of the chair,
      reflecting, partly on the situation of his master, and partly on the great
      satisfaction it would have afforded him to make a fierce assault upon all
      the turnkeys there assembled, one after the other, if it were lawful and
      peaceable so to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the likeness was completed, and Mr. Pickwick was informed that
      he might now proceed into the prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where am I to sleep to-night?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t rightly know about to-night,&rsquo; replied the stout turnkey.
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be chummed on somebody to-morrow, and then you&rsquo;ll be all snug and
      comfortable. The first night&rsquo;s generally rather unsettled, but you&rsquo;ll be
      set all squares to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After some discussion, it was discovered that one of the turnkeys had a
      bed to let, which Mr. Pickwick could have for that night. He gladly agreed
      to hire it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you&rsquo;ll come with me, I&rsquo;ll show it you at once,&rsquo; said the man. &lsquo;It
      ain&rsquo;t a large &lsquo;un; but it&rsquo;s an out-and-outer to sleep in. This way, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed through the inner gate, and descended a short flight of steps.
      The key was turned after them; and Mr. Pickwick found himself, for the
      first time in his life, within the walls of a debtors&rsquo; prison.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI. WHAT BEFELL MR. PICKWICK WHEN HE GOT INTO THE FLEET; WHAT
      PRISONERS HE SAW THERE, AND HOW HE PASSED THE NIGHT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Tom Roker, the
      gentleman who had accompanied Mr. Pickwick into the prison, turned sharp
      round to the right when he got to the bottom of the little flight of
      steps, and led the way, through an iron gate which stood open, and up
      another short flight of steps, into a long narrow gallery, dirty and low,
      paved with stone, and very dimly lighted by a window at each remote end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said the gentleman, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and
      looking carelessly over his shoulder to Mr. Pickwick&mdash;&lsquo;this here is
      the hall flight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, looking down a dark and filthy staircase,
      which appeared to lead to a range of damp and gloomy stone vaults, beneath
      the ground, &lsquo;and those, I suppose, are the little cellars where the
      prisoners keep their small quantities of coals. Unpleasant places to have
      to go down to; but very convenient, I dare say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if they was convenient,&rsquo; replied the gentleman,
      &lsquo;seeing that a few people live there, pretty snug. That&rsquo;s the Fair, that
      is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friend,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t really mean to say that human
      beings live down in those wretched dungeons?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; replied Mr. Roker, with indignant astonishment; &lsquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t
      I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Live!&mdash;live down there!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Live down there! Yes, and die down there, too, very often!&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Roker; &lsquo;and what of that? Who&rsquo;s got to say anything agin it? Live down
      there! Yes, and a wery good place it is to live in, ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Roker turned somewhat fiercely upon Mr. Pickwick in saying this, and
      moreover muttered in an excited fashion certain unpleasant invocations
      concerning his own eyes, limbs, and circulating fluids, the latter
      gentleman deemed it advisable to pursue the discourse no further. Mr.
      Roker then proceeded to mount another staircase, as dirty as that which
      led to the place which has just been the subject of discussion, in which
      ascent he was closely followed by Mr. Pickwick and Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There,&rsquo; said Mr. Roker, pausing for breath when they reached another
      gallery of the same dimensions as the one below, &lsquo;this is the coffee-room
      flight; the one above&rsquo;s the third, and the one above that&rsquo;s the top; and
      the room where you&rsquo;re a-going to sleep to-night is the warden&rsquo;s room, and
      it&rsquo;s this way&mdash;come on.&rsquo; Having said all this in a breath, Mr. Roker
      mounted another flight of stairs with Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller
      following at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      These staircases received light from sundry windows placed at some little
      distance above the floor, and looking into a gravelled area bounded by a
      high brick wall, with iron <i>chevaux-de-frise</i> at the top. This area,
      it appeared from Mr. Roker&rsquo;s statement, was the racket-ground; and it
      further appeared, on the testimony of the same gentleman, that there was a
      smaller area in that portion of the prison which was nearest Farringdon
      Street, denominated and called &lsquo;the Painted Ground,&rsquo; from the fact of its
      walls having once displayed the semblance of various men-of-war in full
      sail, and other artistical effects achieved in bygone times by some
      imprisoned draughtsman in his leisure hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having communicated this piece of information, apparently more for the
      purpose of discharging his bosom of an important fact, than with any
      specific view of enlightening Mr. Pickwick, the guide, having at length
      reached another gallery, led the way into a small passage at the extreme
      end, opened a door, and disclosed an apartment of an appearance by no
      means inviting, containing eight or nine iron bedsteads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There,&rsquo; said Mr. Roker, holding the door open, and looking triumphantly
      round at Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a room!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s face, however, betokened such a very trifling portion of
      satisfaction at the appearance of his lodging, that Mr. Roker looked, for
      a reciprocity of feeling, into the countenance of Samuel Weller, who,
      until now, had observed a dignified silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a room, young man,&rsquo; observed Mr. Roker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see it,&rsquo; replied Sam, with a placid nod of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think to find such a room as this in the Farringdon Hotel,
      would you?&rsquo; said Mr. Roker, with a complacent smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Mr. Weller replied with an easy and unstudied closing of one eye;
      which might be considered to mean, either that he would have thought it,
      or that he would not have thought it, or that he had never thought
      anything at all about it, as the observer&rsquo;s imagination suggested. Having
      executed this feat, and reopened his eye, Mr. Weller proceeded to inquire
      which was the individual bedstead that Mr. Roker had so flatteringly
      described as an out-and-outer to sleep in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rsquo; replied Mr. Roker, pointing to a very rusty one in a corner.
      &lsquo;It would make any one go to sleep, that bedstead would, whether they
      wanted to or not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think,&rsquo; said Sam, eyeing the piece of furniture in question with
      a look of excessive disgust&mdash;&lsquo;I should think poppies was nothing to
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing at all,&rsquo; said Mr. Roker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I s&rsquo;pose,&rsquo; said Sam, with a sidelong glance at his master, as if to
      see whether there were any symptoms of his determination being shaken by
      what passed, &lsquo;I s&rsquo;pose the other gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men as sleeps here <i>are </i>gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing but it,&rsquo; said Mr. Roker. &lsquo;One of &lsquo;em takes his twelve pints of
      ale a day, and never leaves off smoking even at his meals.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must be a first-rater,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A1,&rsquo; replied Mr. Roker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing daunted, even by this intelligence, Mr. Pickwick smilingly
      announced his determination to test the powers of the narcotic bedstead
      for that night; and Mr. Roker, after informing him that he could retire to
      rest at whatever hour he thought proper, without any further notice or
      formality, walked off, leaving him standing with Sam in the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was getting dark; that is to say, a few gas jets were kindled in this
      place which was never light, by way of compliment to the evening, which
      had set in outside. As it was rather warm, some of the tenants of the
      numerous little rooms which opened into the gallery on either hand, had
      set their doors ajar. Mr. Pickwick peeped into them as he passed along,
      with great curiosity and interest. Here, four or five great hulking
      fellows, just visible through a cloud of tobacco smoke, were engaged in
      noisy and riotous conversation over half-emptied pots of beer, or playing
      at all-fours with a very greasy pack of cards. In the adjoining room, some
      solitary tenant might be seen poring, by the light of a feeble tallow
      candle, over a bundle of soiled and tattered papers, yellow with dust and
      dropping to pieces from age, writing, for the hundredth time, some
      lengthened statement of his grievances, for the perusal of some great man
      whose eyes it would never reach, or whose heart it would never touch. In a
      third, a man, with his wife and a whole crowd of children, might be seen
      making up a scanty bed on the ground, or upon a few chairs, for the
      younger ones to pass the night in. And in a fourth, and a fifth, and a
      sixth, and a seventh, the noise, and the beer, and the tobacco smoke, and
      the cards, all came over again in greater force than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the galleries themselves, and more especially on the stair-cases, there
      lingered a great number of people, who came there, some because their
      rooms were empty and lonesome, others because their rooms were full and
      hot; the greater part because they were restless and uncomfortable, and
      not possessed of the secret of exactly knowing what to do with themselves.
      There were many classes of people here, from the labouring man in his
      fustian jacket, to the broken-down spendthrift in his shawl dressing-gown,
      most appropriately out at elbows; but there was the same air about them
      all&mdash;a kind of listless, jail-bird, careless swagger, a vagabondish
      who&rsquo;s-afraid sort of bearing, which is wholly indescribable in words, but
      which any man can understand in one moment if he wish, by setting foot in
      the nearest debtors&rsquo; prison, and looking at the very first group of people
      he sees there, with the same interest as Mr. Pickwick did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It strikes me, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, leaning over the iron rail at the
      stair-head, &lsquo;it strikes me, Sam, that imprisonment for debt is scarcely
      any punishment at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think not, sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see how these fellows drink, and smoke, and roar,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Pickwick. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s quite impossible that they can mind it much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s just the wery thing, Sir,&rsquo; rejoined Sam, &lsquo;they don&rsquo;t mind it;
      it&rsquo;s a reg&rsquo;lar holiday to them&mdash;all porter and skittles. It&rsquo;s the
      t&rsquo;other vuns as gets done over vith this sort o&rsquo; thing; them down-hearted
      fellers as can&rsquo;t svig avay at the beer, nor play at skittles neither; them
      as vould pay if they could, and gets low by being boxed up. I&rsquo;ll tell you
      wot it is, sir; them as is always a-idlin&rsquo; in public-houses it don&rsquo;t
      damage at all, and them as is alvays a-workin&rsquo; wen they can, it damages
      too much. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unekal,&rdquo; as my father used to say wen his grog worn&rsquo;t made
      half-and-half: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s unekal, and that&rsquo;s the fault on it.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you&rsquo;re right, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, after a few moments&rsquo; 
      reflection, &lsquo;quite right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;P&rsquo;raps, now and then, there&rsquo;s some honest people as likes it,&rsquo; observed
      Mr. Weller, in a ruminative tone, &lsquo;but I never heerd o&rsquo; one as I can call
      to mind, &lsquo;cept the little dirty-faced man in the brown coat; and that was
      force of habit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And who was he?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wy, that&rsquo;s just the wery point as nobody never know&rsquo;d,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what did he do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wy, he did wot many men as has been much better know&rsquo;d has done in their
      time, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam, &lsquo;he run a match agin the constable, and vun it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In other words, I suppose,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;he got into debt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just that, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam, &lsquo;and in course o&rsquo; time he come here in
      consekens. It warn&rsquo;t much&mdash;execution for nine pound nothin&rsquo;,
      multiplied by five for costs; but hows&rsquo;ever here he stopped for seventeen
      year. If he got any wrinkles in his face, they were stopped up vith the
      dirt, for both the dirty face and the brown coat wos just the same at the
      end o&rsquo; that time as they wos at the beginnin&rsquo;. He wos a wery peaceful,
      inoffendin&rsquo; little creetur, and wos alvays a-bustlin&rsquo; about for somebody,
      or playin&rsquo; rackets and never vinnin&rsquo;; till at last the turnkeys they got
      quite fond on him, and he wos in the lodge ev&rsquo;ry night, a-chattering vith
      &lsquo;em, and tellin&rsquo; stories, and all that &lsquo;ere. Vun night he wos in there as
      usual, along vith a wery old friend of his, as wos on the lock, ven he
      says all of a sudden, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t seen the market outside, Bill,&rdquo; he says
      (Fleet Market wos there at that time)&mdash;&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t seen the market
      outside, Bill,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;for seventeen year.&rdquo; &ldquo;I know you ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says
      the turnkey, smoking his pipe. &ldquo;I should like to see it for a minit,
      Bill,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Wery probable,&rdquo; says the turnkey, smoking his pipe wery
      fierce, and making believe he warn&rsquo;t up to wot the little man wanted.
      &ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; says the little man, more abrupt than afore, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the fancy
      in my head. Let me see the public streets once more afore I die; and if I
      ain&rsquo;t struck with apoplexy, I&rsquo;ll be back in five minits by the clock.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;And wot &lsquo;ud become o&rsquo; me if you <i>wos </i>struck with apoplexy?&rdquo; said
      the turnkey. &ldquo;Wy,&rdquo; says the little creetur, &ldquo;whoever found me, &lsquo;ud bring
      me home, for I&rsquo;ve got my card in my pocket, Bill,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;No. 20,
      Coffee-room Flight&rdquo;: and that wos true, sure enough, for wen he wanted to
      make the acquaintance of any new-comer, he used to pull out a little limp
      card vith them words on it and nothin&rsquo; else; in consideration of vich, he
      vos alvays called Number Tventy. The turnkey takes a fixed look at him,
      and at last he says in a solemn manner, &ldquo;Tventy,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trust
      you; you Won&rsquo;t get your old friend into trouble.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, my boy; I hope I&rsquo;ve
      somethin&rsquo; better behind here,&rdquo; says the little man; and as he said it he
      hit his little vesket wery hard, and then a tear started out o&rsquo; each eye,
      which wos wery extraordinary, for it wos supposed as water never touched
      his face. He shook the turnkey by the hand; out he vent&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And never came back again,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wrong for vunce, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, &lsquo;for back he come, two minits
      afore the time, a-bilin&rsquo; with rage, sayin&rsquo; how he&rsquo;d been nearly run over
      by a hackney-coach that he warn&rsquo;t used to it; and he was blowed if he
      wouldn&rsquo;t write to the lord mayor. They got him pacified at last; and for
      five years arter that, he never even so much as peeped out o&rsquo; the lodge
      gate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the expiration of that time he died, I suppose,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;He got a curiosity to go and taste the
      beer at a new public-house over the way, and it wos such a wery nice
      parlour, that he took it into his head to go there every night, which he
      did for a long time, always comin&rsquo; back reg&rsquo;lar about a quarter of an hour
      afore the gate shut, which was all wery snug and comfortable. At last he
      began to get so precious jolly, that he used to forget how the time vent,
      or care nothin&rsquo; at all about it, and he went on gettin&rsquo; later and later,
      till vun night his old friend wos just a-shuttin&rsquo; the gate&mdash;had
      turned the key in fact&mdash;wen he come up. &ldquo;Hold hard, Bill,&rdquo; he says.
      &ldquo;Wot, ain&rsquo;t you come home yet, Tventy?&rdquo; says the turnkey, &ldquo;I thought you
      wos in, long ago.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says the little man, with a smile.
      &ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll tell you wot it is, my friend,&rdquo; says the turnkey,
      openin&rsquo; the gate wery slow and sulky, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s my &lsquo;pinion as you&rsquo;ve got into
      bad company o&rsquo; late, which I&rsquo;m wery sorry to see. Now, I don&rsquo;t wish to do
      nothing harsh,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but if you can&rsquo;t confine yourself to steady
      circles, and find your vay back at reg&rsquo;lar hours, as sure as you&rsquo;re
      a-standin&rsquo; there, I&rsquo;ll shut you out altogether!&rdquo; The little man was seized
      vith a wiolent fit o&rsquo; tremblin&rsquo;, and never vent outside the prison walls
      artervards!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Sam concluded, Mr. Pickwick slowly retraced his steps downstairs. After
      a few thoughtful turns in the Painted Ground, which, as it was now dark,
      was nearly deserted, he intimated to Mr. Weller that he thought it high
      time for him to withdraw for the night; requesting him to seek a bed in
      some adjacent public-house, and return early in the morning, to make
      arrangements for the removal of his master&rsquo;s wardrobe from the George and
      Vulture. This request Mr. Samuel Weller prepared to obey, with as good a
      grace as he could assume, but with a very considerable show of reluctance
      nevertheless. He even went so far as to essay sundry ineffectual hints
      regarding the expediency of stretching himself on the gravel for that
      night; but finding Mr. Pickwick obstinately deaf to any such suggestions,
      finally withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no disguising the fact that Mr. Pickwick felt very low-spirited
      and uncomfortable&mdash;not for lack of society, for the prison was very
      full, and a bottle of wine would at once have purchased the utmost
      good-fellowship of a few choice spirits, without any more formal ceremony
      of introduction; but he was alone in the coarse, vulgar crowd, and felt
      the depression of spirits and sinking of heart, naturally consequent on
      the reflection that he was cooped and caged up, without a prospect of
      liberation. As to the idea of releasing himself by ministering to the
      sharpness of Dodson &amp; Fogg, it never for an instant entered his
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this frame of mind he turned again into the coffee-room gallery, and
      walked slowly to and fro. The place was intolerably dirty, and the smell
      of tobacco smoke perfectly suffocating. There was a perpetual slamming and
      banging of doors as the people went in and out; and the noise of their
      voices and footsteps echoed and re-echoed through the passages constantly.
      A young woman, with a child in her arms, who seemed scarcely able to
      crawl, from emaciation and misery, was walking up and down the passage in
      conversation with her husband, who had no other place to see her in. As
      they passed Mr. Pickwick, he could hear the female sob bitterly; and once
      she burst into such a passion of grief, that she was compelled to lean
      against the wall for support, while the man took the child in his arms,
      and tried to soothe her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s heart was really too full to bear it, and he went upstairs
      to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, although the warder&rsquo;s room was a very uncomfortable one (being, in
      every point of decoration and convenience, several hundred degrees
      inferior to the common infirmary of a county jail), it had at present the
      merit of being wholly deserted save by Mr. Pickwick himself. So, he sat
      down at the foot of his little iron bedstead, and began to wonder how much
      a year the warder made out of the dirty room. Having satisfied himself, by
      mathematical calculation, that the apartment was about equal in annual
      value to the freehold of a small street in the suburbs of London, he took
      to wondering what possible temptation could have induced a dingy-looking
      fly that was crawling over his pantaloons, to come into a close prison,
      when he had the choice of so many airy situations&mdash;a course of
      meditation which led him to the irresistible conclusion that the insect
      was insane. After settling this point, he began to be conscious that he
      was getting sleepy; whereupon he took his nightcap out of the pocket in
      which he had had the precaution to stow it in the morning, and, leisurely
      undressing himself, got into bed and fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bravo! Heel over toe&mdash;cut and shuffle&mdash;pay away at it, Zephyr!
      I&rsquo;m smothered if the opera house isn&rsquo;t your proper hemisphere. Keep it up!
      Hooray!&rsquo; These expressions, delivered in a most boisterous tone, and
      accompanied with loud peals of laughter, roused Mr. Pickwick from one of
      those sound slumbers which, lasting in reality some half-hour, seem to the
      sleeper to have been protracted for three weeks or a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice had no sooner ceased than the room was shaken with such violence
      that the windows rattled in their frames, and the bedsteads trembled
      again. Mr. Pickwick started up, and remained for some minutes fixed in
      mute astonishment at the scene before him.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      On the floor of the room, a man in a broad-skirted green coat, with
      corduroy knee-smalls and gray cotton stockings, was performing the most
      popular steps of a hornpipe, with a slang and burlesque caricature of
      grace and lightness, which, combined with the very appropriate character
      of his costume, was inexpressibly absurd. Another man, evidently very
      drunk, who had probably been tumbled into bed by his companions, was
      sitting up between the sheets, warbling as much as he could recollect of a
      comic song, with the most intensely sentimental feeling and expression;
      while a third, seated on one of the bedsteads, was applauding both
      performers with the air of a profound connoisseur, and encouraging them by
      such ebullitions of feeling as had already roused Mr. Pickwick from his
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last man was an admirable specimen of a class of gentry which never
      can be seen in full perfection but in such places&mdash;they may be met
      with, in an imperfect state, occasionally about stable-yards and
      Public-houses; but they never attain their full bloom except in these
      hot-beds, which would almost seem to be considerately provided by the
      legislature for the sole purpose of rearing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a tall fellow, with an olive complexion, long dark hair, and very
      thick bushy whiskers meeting under his chin. He wore no neckerchief, as he
      had been playing rackets all day, and his open shirt collar displayed
      their full luxuriance. On his head he wore one of the common eighteenpenny
      French skull-caps, with a gaudy tassel dangling therefrom, very happily in
      keeping with a common fustian coat. His legs, which, being long, were
      afflicted with weakness, graced a pair of Oxford-mixture trousers, made to
      show the full symmetry of those limbs. Being somewhat negligently braced,
      however, and, moreover, but imperfectly buttoned, they fell in a series of
      not the most graceful folds over a pair of shoes sufficiently down at heel
      to display a pair of very soiled white stockings. There was a rakish,
      vagabond smartness, and a kind of boastful rascality, about the whole man,
      that was worth a mine of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      This figure was the first to perceive that Mr. Pickwick was looking on;
      upon which he winked to the Zephyr, and entreated him, with mock gravity,
      not to wake the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, bless the gentleman&rsquo;s honest heart and soul!&rsquo; said the Zephyr,
      turning round and affecting the extremity of surprise; &lsquo;the gentleman is
      awake. Hem, Shakespeare! How do you do, Sir? How is Mary and Sarah, sir?
      and the dear old lady at home, Sir? Will you have the kindness to put my
      compliments into the first little parcel you&rsquo;re sending that way, sir, and
      say that I would have sent &lsquo;em before, only I was afraid they might be
      broken in the wagon, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t overwhelm the gentlemen with ordinary civilities when you see he&rsquo;s
      anxious to have something to drink,&rsquo; said the gentleman with the whiskers,
      with a jocose air. &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask the gentleman what he&rsquo;ll take?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, I quite forgot,&rsquo; replied the other. &lsquo;What will you take, sir?
      Will you take port wine, sir, or sherry wine, sir? I can recommend the
      ale, sir; or perhaps you&rsquo;d like to taste the porter, sir? Allow me to have
      the felicity of hanging up your nightcap, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, the speaker snatched that article of dress from Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      head, and fixed it in a twinkling on that of the drunken man, who, firmly
      impressed with the belief that he was delighting a numerous assembly,
      continued to hammer away at the comic song in the most melancholy strains
      imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a man&rsquo;s nightcap from his brow by violent means, and adjusting it
      on the head of an unknown gentleman, of dirty exterior, however ingenious
      a witticism in itself, is unquestionably one of those which come under the
      denomination of practical jokes. Viewing the matter precisely in this
      light, Mr. Pickwick, without the slightest intimation of his purpose,
      sprang vigorously out of bed, struck the Zephyr so smart a blow in the
      chest as to deprive him of a considerable portion of the commodity which
      sometimes bears his name, and then, recapturing his nightcap, boldly
      placed himself in an attitude of defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, gasping no less from excitement than from the
      expenditure of so much energy, &lsquo;come on&mdash;both of you&mdash;both of
      you!&rsquo; With this liberal invitation the worthy gentleman communicated a
      revolving motion to his clenched fists, by way of appalling his
      antagonists with a display of science.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s very unexpected gallantry, or it might
      have been the complicated manner in which he had got himself out of bed,
      and fallen all in a mass upon the hornpipe man, that touched his
      adversaries. Touched they were; for, instead of then and there making an
      attempt to commit man-slaughter, as Mr. Pickwick implicitly believed they
      would have done, they paused, stared at each other a short time, and
      finally laughed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a trump, and I like you all the better for it,&rsquo; said the
      Zephyr. &lsquo;Now jump into bed again, or you&rsquo;ll catch the rheumatics. No
      malice, I hope?&rsquo; said the man, extending a hand the size of the yellow
      clump of fingers which sometimes swings over a glover&rsquo;s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with great alacrity; for, now that the
      excitement was over, he began to feel rather cool about the legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Allow me the H-onour,&rsquo; said the gentleman with the whiskers, presenting
      his dexter hand, and aspirating the h.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With much pleasure, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; and having executed a very
      long and solemn shake, he got into bed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name is Smangle, sir,&rsquo; said the man with the whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mine is Mivins,&rsquo; said the man in the stockings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am delighted to hear it, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hem,&rsquo; coughed Mr. Smangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you speak, sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I did not, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Smangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was very genteel and pleasant; and, to make matters still more
      comfortable, Mr. Smangle assured Mr. Pickwick a great many more times that
      he entertained a very high respect for the feelings of a gentleman; which
      sentiment, indeed, did him infinite credit, as he could be in no wise
      supposed to understand them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you going through the court, sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Smangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Through the what?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Through the court&mdash;Portugal Street&mdash;the Court for Relief of&mdash;you
      know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;No, I am not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going out, perhaps?&rsquo; suggested Mr. Mivins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;I refuse to pay some damages, and am
      here in consequence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Mr. Smangle, &lsquo;paper has been my ruin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A stationer, I presume, Sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stationer! No, no; confound and curse me! Not so low as that. No trade.
      When I say paper, I mean bills.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you use the word in that sense. I see,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damme! A gentleman must expect reverses,&rsquo; said Smangle. &lsquo;What of that?
      Here am I in the Fleet Prison. Well; good. What then? I&rsquo;m none the worse
      for that, am I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit,&rsquo; replied Mr. Mivins. And he was quite right; for, so far from
      Mr. Smangle being any the worse for it, he was something the better,
      inasmuch as to qualify himself for the place, he had attained gratuitous
      possession of certain articles of jewellery, which, long before that, had
      found their way to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well; but come,&rsquo; said Mr. Smangle; &lsquo;this is dry work. Let&rsquo;s rinse our
      mouths with a drop of burnt sherry; the last-comer shall stand it, Mivins
      shall fetch it, and I&rsquo;ll help to drink it. That&rsquo;s a fair and gentlemanlike
      division of labour, anyhow. Curse me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Unwilling to hazard another quarrel, Mr. Pickwick gladly assented to the
      proposition, and consigned the money to Mr. Mivins, who, as it was nearly
      eleven o&rsquo;clock, lost no time in repairing to the coffee-room on his
      errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; whispered Smangle, the moment his friend had left the room; &lsquo;what
      did you give him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Half a sovereign,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a devilish pleasant gentlemanly dog,&rsquo; said Mr. Smangle;&mdash;&lsquo;infernal
      pleasant. I don&rsquo;t know anybody more so; but&mdash;&rsquo; Here Mr. Smangle
      stopped short, and shook his head dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t think there is any probability of his appropriating the money
      to his own use?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no! Mind, I don&rsquo;t say that; I expressly say that he&rsquo;s a devilish
      gentlemanly fellow,&rsquo; said Mr. Smangle. &lsquo;But I think, perhaps, if somebody
      went down, just to see that he didn&rsquo;t dip his beak into the jug by
      accident, or make some confounded mistake in losing the money as he came
      upstairs, it would be as well. Here, you sir, just run downstairs, and
      look after that gentleman, will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This request was addressed to a little timid-looking, nervous man, whose
      appearance bespoke great poverty, and who had been crouching on his
      bedstead all this while, apparently stupefied by the novelty of his
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know where the coffee-room is,&rsquo; said Smangle; &lsquo;just run down, and
      tell that gentleman you&rsquo;ve come to help him up with the jug. Or&mdash;stop&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      tell you what&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you how we&rsquo;ll do him,&rsquo; said Smangle, with a
      cunning look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Send down word that he&rsquo;s to spend the change in cigars. Capital thought.
      Run and tell him that; d&rsquo;ye hear? They shan&rsquo;t be wasted,&rsquo; continued
      Smangle, turning to Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> smoke &lsquo;em.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This manoeuvring was so exceedingly ingenious and, withal, performed with
      such immovable composure and coolness, that Mr. Pickwick would have had no
      wish to disturb it, even if he had had the power. In a short time Mr.
      Mivins returned, bearing the sherry, which Mr. Smangle dispensed in two
      little cracked mugs; considerately remarking, with reference to himself,
      that a gentleman must not be particular under such circumstances, and
      that, for his part, he was not too proud to drink out of the jug. In
      which, to show his sincerity, he forthwith pledged the company in a
      draught which half emptied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      An excellent understanding having been by these means promoted, Mr.
      Smangle proceeded to entertain his hearers with a relation of divers
      romantic adventures in which he had been from time to time engaged,
      involving various interesting anecdotes of a thoroughbred horse, and a
      magnificent Jewess, both of surpassing beauty, and much coveted by the
      nobility and gentry of these kingdoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before these elegant extracts from the biography of a gentleman were
      concluded, Mr. Mivins had betaken himself to bed, and had set in snoring
      for the night, leaving the timid stranger and Mr. Pickwick to the full
      benefit of Mr. Smangle&rsquo;s experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were the two last-named gentlemen as much edified as they might have
      been by the moving passages narrated. Mr. Pickwick had been in a state of
      slumber for some time, when he had a faint perception of the drunken man
      bursting out afresh with the comic song, and receiving from Mr. Smangle a
      gentle intimation, through the medium of the water-jug, that his audience
      was not musically disposed. Mr. Pickwick then once again dropped off to
      sleep, with a confused consciousness that Mr. Smangle was still engaged in
      relating a long story, the chief point of which appeared to be that, on
      some occasion particularly stated and set forth, he had &lsquo;done&rsquo; a bill and
      a gentleman at the same time.

      CHAPTER XLII. ILLUSTRATIVE, LIKE THE PRECEDING ONE, OF THE OLD PROVERB,
      THAT ADVERSITY BRINGS A MAN ACQUAINTED WITH STRANGE BEDFELLOWS&mdash;
      LIKEWISE CONTAINING MR. PICKWICK&rsquo;S EXTRAORDINARY AND STARTLING
      ANNOUNCEMENT TO MR. SAMUEL WELLER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Mr. Pickwick
      opened his eyes next morning, the first object upon which they rested was
      Samuel Weller, seated upon a small black portmanteau, intently regarding,
      apparently in a condition of profound abstraction, the stately figure of
      the dashing Mr. Smangle; while Mr. Smangle himself, who was already
      partially dressed, was seated on his bedstead, occupied in the desperately
      hopeless attempt of staring Mr. Weller out of countenance. We say
      desperately hopeless, because Sam, with a comprehensive gaze which took in
      Mr. Smangle&rsquo;s cap, feet, head, face, legs, and whiskers, all at the same
      time, continued to look steadily on, with every demonstration of lively
      satisfaction, but with no more regard to Mr. Smangle&rsquo;s personal sentiments
      on the subject than he would have displayed had he been inspecting a
      wooden statue, or a straw-embowelled Guy Fawkes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well; will you know me again?&rsquo; said Mr. Smangle, with a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d svear to you anyveres, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be impertinent to a gentleman, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Smangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not on no account,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;If you&rsquo;ll tell me wen he wakes, I&rsquo;ll be
      upon the wery best extra-super behaviour!&rsquo; This observation, having a
      remote tendency to imply that Mr. Smangle was no gentleman, kindled his
      ire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mivins!&rsquo; said Mr. Smangle, with a passionate air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the office?&rsquo; replied that gentleman from his couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who the devil is this fellow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Gad,&rsquo; said Mr. Mivins, looking lazily out from under the bed-clothes, &lsquo;I
      ought to ask <i>you </i>that. Hasn&rsquo;t he any business here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Mr. Smangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then knock him downstairs, and tell him not to presume to get up till I
      come and kick him,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Mivins; with this prompt advice that
      excellent gentleman again betook himself to slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation exhibiting these unequivocal symptoms of verging on the
      personal, Mr. Pickwick deemed it a fit point at which to interpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; rejoined that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has anything new occurred since last night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothin&rsquo; partickler, sir,&rsquo; replied Sam, glancing at Mr. Smangle&rsquo;s
      whiskers; &lsquo;the late prewailance of a close and confined atmosphere has
      been rayther favourable to the growth of veeds, of an alarmin&rsquo; and
      sangvinary natur; but vith that &lsquo;ere exception things is quiet enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall get up,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;give me some clean things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever hostile intentions Mr. Smangle might have entertained, his
      thoughts were speedily diverted by the unpacking of the portmanteau; the
      contents of which appeared to impress him at once with a most favourable
      opinion, not only of Mr. Pickwick, but of Sam also, who, he took an early
      opportunity of declaring in a tone of voice loud enough for that eccentric
      personage to overhear, was a regular thoroughbred original, and
      consequently the very man after his own heart. As to Mr. Pickwick, the
      affection he conceived for him knew no limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now is there anything I can do for you, my dear Sir?&rsquo; said Smangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing that I am aware of, I am obliged to you,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No linen that you want sent to the washerwoman&rsquo;s? I know a delightful
      washerwoman outside, that comes for my things twice a week; and, by Jove!&mdash;how
      devilish lucky!&mdash;this is the day she calls. Shall I put any of those
      little things up with mine? Don&rsquo;t say anything about the trouble. Confound
      and curse it! if one gentleman under a cloud is not to put himself a
      little out of the way to assist another gentleman in the same condition,
      what&rsquo;s human nature?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus spake Mr. Smangle, edging himself meanwhile as near as possible to
      the portmanteau, and beaming forth looks of the most fervent and
      disinterested friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing you want to give out for the man to brush, my dear
      creature, is there?&rsquo; resumed Smangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothin&rsquo; whatever, my fine feller,&rsquo; rejoined Sam, taking the reply into
      his own mouth. &lsquo;P&rsquo;raps if vun of us wos to brush, without troubling the
      man, it &lsquo;ud be more agreeable for all parties, as the schoolmaster said
      when the young gentleman objected to being flogged by the butler.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And there&rsquo;s nothing I can send in my little box to the washer-woman&rsquo;s, is
      there?&rsquo; said Smangle, turning from Sam to Mr. Pickwick, with an air of
      some discomfiture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothin&rsquo; whatever, Sir,&rsquo; retorted Sam; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afeered the little box must be
      chock full o&rsquo; your own as it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech was accompanied with such a very expressive look at that
      particular portion of Mr. Smangle&rsquo;s attire, by the appearance of which the
      skill of laundresses in getting up gentlemen&rsquo;s linen is generally tested,
      that he was fain to turn upon his heel, and, for the present at any rate,
      to give up all design on Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s purse and wardrobe. He accordingly
      retired in dudgeon to the racket-ground, where he made a light and
      whole-some breakfast on a couple of the cigars which had been purchased on
      the previous night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mivins, who was no smoker, and whose account for small articles of
      chandlery had also reached down to the bottom of the slate, and been
      &lsquo;carried over&rsquo; to the other side, remained in bed, and, in his own words,
      &lsquo;took it out in sleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfasting in a small closet attached to the coffee-room, which
      bore the imposing title of the Snuggery, the temporary inmate of which, in
      consideration of a small additional charge, had the unspeakable advantage
      of overhearing all the conversation in the coffee-room aforesaid; and,
      after despatching Mr. Weller on some necessary errands, Mr. Pickwick
      repaired to the lodge, to consult Mr. Roker concerning his future
      accommodation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Accommodation, eh?&rsquo; said that gentleman, consulting a large book. &lsquo;Plenty
      of that, Mr. Pickwick. Your chummage ticket will be on twenty-seven, in
      the third.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;My what, did you say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your chummage ticket,&rsquo; replied Mr. Roker; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re up to that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not quite,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said Mr. Roker, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s as plain as Salisbury. You&rsquo;ll have a chummage
      ticket upon twenty-seven in the third, and them as is in the room will be
      your chums.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are there many of them?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three,&rsquo; replied Mr. Roker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One of &lsquo;em&rsquo;s a parson,&rsquo; said Mr. Roker, filling up a little piece of
      paper as he spoke; &lsquo;another&rsquo;s a butcher.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A butcher,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Roker, giving the nib of his pen a tap on the
      desk to cure it of a disinclination to mark. &lsquo;What a thorough-paced goer
      he used to be sure-ly! You remember Tom Martin, Neddy?&rsquo; said Roker,
      appealing to another man in the lodge, who was paring the mud off his
      shoes with a five-and-twenty-bladed pocket-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think so,&rsquo; replied the party addressed, with a strong emphasis
      on the personal pronoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless my dear eyes!&rsquo; said Mr. Roker, shaking his head slowly from side to
      side, and gazing abstractedly out of the grated windows before him, as if
      he were fondly recalling some peaceful scene of his early youth; &lsquo;it seems
      but yesterday that he whopped the coal-heaver down Fox-under-the-Hill by
      the wharf there. I think I can see him now, a-coming up the Strand between
      the two street-keepers, a little sobered by the bruising, with a patch o&rsquo; 
      winegar and brown paper over his right eyelid, and that &lsquo;ere lovely
      bulldog, as pinned the little boy arterwards, a-following at his heels.
      What a rum thing time is, ain&rsquo;t it, Neddy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman to whom these observations were addressed, who appeared of a
      taciturn and thoughtful cast, merely echoed the inquiry; Mr. Roker,
      shaking off the poetical and gloomy train of thought into which he had
      been betrayed, descended to the common business of life, and resumed his
      pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know what the third gentlemen is?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, not very
      much gratified by this description of his future associates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is that Simpson, Neddy?&rsquo; said Mr. Roker, turning to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What Simpson?&rsquo; said Neddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, him in twenty-seven in the third, that this gentleman&rsquo;s going to be
      chummed on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, him!&rsquo; replied Neddy; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s nothing exactly. He <i>was </i>a horse
      chaunter: he&rsquo;s a leg now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, so I thought,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Roker, closing the book, and placing the
      small piece of paper in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s hands. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the ticket, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Very much perplexed by this summary disposition of this person, Mr.
      Pickwick walked back into the prison, revolving in his mind what he had
      better do. Convinced, however, that before he took any other steps it
      would be advisable to see, and hold personal converse with, the three
      gentlemen with whom it was proposed to quarter him, he made the best of
      his way to the third flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      After groping about in the gallery for some time, attempting in the dim
      light to decipher the numbers on the different doors, he at length
      appealed to a pot-boy, who happened to be pursuing his morning occupation
      of gleaning for pewter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which is twenty-seven, my good fellow?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Five doors farther on,&rsquo; replied the pot-boy. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the likeness of a
      man being hung, and smoking the while, chalked outside the door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Guided by this direction, Mr. Pickwick proceeded slowly along the gallery
      until he encountered the &lsquo;portrait of a gentleman,&rsquo; above described, upon
      whose countenance he tapped, with the knuckle of his forefinger&mdash;gently
      at first, and then audibly. After repeating this process several times
      without effect, he ventured to open the door and peep in.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one man in the room, and he was leaning out of window as
      far as he could without overbalancing himself, endeavouring, with great
      perseverance, to spit upon the crown of the hat of a personal friend on
      the parade below. As neither speaking, coughing, sneezing, knocking, nor
      any other ordinary mode of attracting attention, made this person aware of
      the presence of a visitor, Mr. Pickwick, after some delay, stepped up to
      the window, and pulled him gently by the coat tail. The individual brought
      in his head and shoulders with great swiftness, and surveying Mr. Pickwick
      from head to foot, demanded in a surly tone what the&mdash;something
      beginning with a capital H&mdash;he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, consulting his ticket&mdash;&lsquo;I believe
      this is twenty-seven in the third?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; replied the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have come here in consequence of receiving this bit of paper,&rsquo; rejoined
      Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hand it over,&rsquo; said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick complied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think Roker might have chummed you somewhere else,&rsquo; said Mr. Simpson
      (for it was the leg), after a very discontented sort of a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick thought so also; but, under all the circumstances, he
      considered it a matter of sound policy to be silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Simpson mused for a few moments after this, and then, thrusting his
      head out of the window, gave a shrill whistle, and pronounced some word
      aloud, several times. What the word was, Mr. Pickwick could not
      distinguish; but he rather inferred that it must be some nickname which
      distinguished Mr. Martin, from the fact of a great number of gentlemen on
      the ground below, immediately proceeding to cry &lsquo;Butcher!&rsquo; in imitation of
      the tone in which that useful class of society are wont, diurnally, to
      make their presence known at area railings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subsequent occurrences confirmed the accuracy of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      impression; for, in a few seconds, a gentleman, prematurely broad for his
      years, clothed in a professional blue jean frock and top-boots with
      circular toes, entered the room nearly out of breath, closely followed by
      another gentleman in very shabby black, and a sealskin cap. The latter
      gentleman, who fastened his coat all the way up to his chin by means of a
      pin and a button alternately, had a very coarse red face, and looked like
      a drunken chaplain; which, indeed, he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two gentlemen having by turns perused Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s billet, the one
      expressed his opinion that it was &lsquo;a rig,&rsquo; and the other his conviction
      that it was &lsquo;a go.&rsquo; Having recorded their feelings in these very
      intelligible terms, they looked at Mr. Pickwick and each other in awkward
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s an aggravating thing, just as we got the beds so snug,&rsquo; said the
      chaplain, looking at three dirty mattresses, each rolled up in a blanket;
      which occupied one corner of the room during the day, and formed a kind of
      slab, on which were placed an old cracked basin, ewer, and soap-dish, of
      common yellow earthenware, with a blue flower&mdash;&lsquo;very aggravating.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Martin expressed the same opinion in rather stronger terms; Mr.
      Simpson, after having let a variety of expletive adjectives loose upon
      society without any substantive to accompany them, tucked up his sleeves,
      and began to wash the greens for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was going on, Mr. Pickwick had been eyeing the room, which was
      filthily dirty, and smelt intolerably close. There was no vestige of
      either carpet, curtain, or blind. There was not even a closet in it.
      Unquestionably there were but few things to put away, if there had been
      one; but, however few in number, or small in individual amount, still,
      remnants of loaves and pieces of cheese, and damp towels, and scrags of
      meat, and articles of wearing apparel, and mutilated crockery, and bellows
      without nozzles, and toasting-forks without prongs, do present somewhat of
      an uncomfortable appearance when they are scattered about the floor of a
      small apartment, which is the common sitting and sleeping room of three
      idle men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose this can be managed somehow,&rsquo; said the butcher, after a pretty
      long silence. &lsquo;What will you take to go out?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I beg your pardon,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;What did you say? I hardly
      understand you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What will you take to be paid out?&rsquo; said the butcher. &lsquo;The regular
      chummage is two-and-six. Will you take three bob?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a bender,&rsquo; suggested the clerical gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind that; it&rsquo;s only twopence a piece more,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Martin. &lsquo;What do you say, now? We&rsquo;ll pay you out for three-and-sixpence a
      week. Come!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And stand a gallon of beer down,&rsquo; chimed in Mr. Simpson. &lsquo;There!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And drink it on the spot,&rsquo; said the chaplain. &lsquo;Now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really am so wholly ignorant of the rules of this place,&rsquo; returned Mr.
      Pickwick, &lsquo;that I do not yet comprehend you. Can I live anywhere else? I
      thought I could not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this inquiry Mr. Martin looked, with a countenance of excessive
      surprise, at his two friends, and then each gentleman pointed with his
      right thumb over his left shoulder. This action imperfectly described in
      words by the very feeble term of &lsquo;over the left,&rsquo; when performed by any
      number of ladies or gentlemen who are accustomed to act in unison, has a
      very graceful and airy effect; its expression is one of light and playful
      sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Can </i>you!&rsquo; repeated Mr. Martin, with a smile of pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, if I knew as little of life as that, I&rsquo;d eat my hat and swallow the
      buckle whole,&rsquo; said the clerical gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So would I,&rsquo; added the sporting one solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this introductory preface, the three chums informed Mr. Pickwick, in
      a breath, that money was, in the Fleet, just what money was out of it;
      that it would instantly procure him almost anything he desired; and that,
      supposing he had it, and had no objection to spend it, if he only
      signified his wish to have a room to himself, he might take possession of
      one, furnished and fitted to boot, in half an hour&rsquo;s time.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this the parties separated, very much to their common satisfaction;
      Mr. Pickwick once more retracing his steps to the lodge, and the three
      companions adjourning to the coffee-room, there to spend the five
      shillings which the clerical gentleman had, with admirable prudence and
      foresight, borrowed of him for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knowed it!&rsquo; said Mr. Roker, with a chuckle, when Mr. Pickwick stated
      the object with which he had returned. &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say so, Neddy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The philosophical owner of the universal penknife growled an affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knowed you&rsquo;d want a room for yourself, bless you!&rsquo; said Mr. Roker. &lsquo;Let
      me see. You&rsquo;ll want some furniture. You&rsquo;ll hire that of me, I suppose?
      That&rsquo;s the reg&rsquo;lar thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With great pleasure,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a capital room up in the coffee-room flight, that belongs to a
      Chancery prisoner,&rsquo; said Mr. Roker. &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll stand you in a pound a week. I
      suppose you don&rsquo;t mind that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just step there with me,&rsquo; said Roker, taking up his hat with great
      alacrity; &lsquo;the matter&rsquo;s settled in five minutes. Lord! why didn&rsquo;t you say
      at first that you was willing to come down handsome?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter was soon arranged, as the turnkey had foretold. The Chancery
      prisoner had been there long enough to have lost his friends, fortune,
      home, and happiness, and to have acquired the right of having a room to
      himself. As he laboured, however, under the inconvenience of often wanting
      a morsel of bread, he eagerly listened to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s proposal to rent
      the apartment, and readily covenanted and agreed to yield him up the sole
      and undisturbed possession thereof, in consideration of the weekly payment
      of twenty shillings; from which fund he furthermore contracted to pay out
      any person or persons that might be chummed upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they struck the bargain, Mr. Pickwick surveyed him with a painful
      interest. He was a tall, gaunt, cadaverous man, in an old greatcoat and
      slippers, with sunken cheeks, and a restless, eager eye. His lips were
      bloodless, and his bones sharp and thin. God help him! the iron teeth of
      confinement and privation had been slowly filing him down for twenty
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And where will you live meanwhile, Sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as he laid
      the amount of the first week&rsquo;s rent, in advance, on the tottering table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man gathered up the money with a trembling hand, and replied that he
      didn&rsquo;t know yet; he must go and see where he could move his bed to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, laying his hand gently and
      compassionately on his arm&mdash;&lsquo;I am afraid you will have to live in
      some noisy, crowded place. Now, pray, consider this room your own when you
      want quiet, or when any of your friends come to see you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friends!&rsquo; interposed the man, in a voice which rattled in his throat. &lsquo;if
      I lay dead at the bottom of the deepest mine in the world; tight screwed
      down and soldered in my coffin; rotting in the dark and filthy ditch that
      drags its slime along, beneath the foundations of this prison; I could not
      be more forgotten or unheeded than I am here. I am a dead man; dead to
      society, without the pity they bestow on those whose souls have passed to
      judgment. Friends to see me! My God! I have sunk, from the prime of life
      into old age, in this place, and there is not one to raise his hand above
      my bed when I lie dead upon it, and say, &ldquo;It is a blessing he is gone!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The excitement, which had cast an unwonted light over the man&rsquo;s face,
      while he spoke, subsided as he concluded; and pressing his withered hands
      together in a hasty and disordered manner, he shuffled from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rides rather rusty,&rsquo; said Mr. Roker, with a smile. &lsquo;Ah! they&rsquo;re like the
      elephants. They feel it now and then, and it makes &lsquo;em wild!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having made this deeply-sympathising remark, Mr. Roker entered upon his
      arrangements with such expedition, that in a short time the room was
      furnished with a carpet, six chairs, a table, a sofa bedstead, a
      tea-kettle, and various small articles, on hire, at the very reasonable
      rate of seven-and-twenty shillings and sixpence per week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, is there anything more we can do for you?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Roker,
      looking round with great satisfaction, and gaily chinking the first week&rsquo;s
      hire in his closed fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, yes,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, who had been musing deeply for some time.
      &lsquo;Are there any people here who run on errands, and so forth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Outside, do you mean?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Roker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. I mean who are able to go outside. Not prisoners.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, there is,&rsquo; said Roker. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s an unfortunate devil, who has got a
      friend on the poor side, that&rsquo;s glad to do anything of that sort. He&rsquo;s
      been running odd jobs, and that, for the last two months. Shall I send
      him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you please,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Stay; no. The poor side, you say?
      I should like to see it. I&rsquo;ll go to him myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor side of a debtor&rsquo;s prison is, as its name imports, that in which
      the most miserable and abject class of debtors are confined. A prisoner
      having declared upon the poor side, pays neither rent nor chummage. His
      fees, upon entering and leaving the jail, are reduced in amount, and he
      becomes entitled to a share of some small quantities of food: to provide
      which, a few charitable persons have, from time to time, left trifling
      legacies in their wills. Most of our readers will remember, that, until
      within a very few years past, there was a kind of iron cage in the wall of
      the Fleet Prison, within which was posted some man of hungry looks, who,
      from time to time, rattled a money-box, and exclaimed in a mournful voice,
      &lsquo;Pray, remember the poor debtors; pray remember the poor debtors.&rsquo; The
      receipts of this box, when there were any, were divided among the poor
      prisoners; and the men on the poor side relieved each other in this
      degrading office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although this custom has been abolished, and the cage is now boarded up,
      the miserable and destitute condition of these unhappy persons remains the
      same. We no longer suffer them to appeal at the prison gates to the
      charity and compassion of the passersby; but we still leave unblotted the
      leaves of our statute book, for the reverence and admiration of succeeding
      ages, the just and wholesome law which declares that the sturdy felon
      shall be fed and clothed, and that the penniless debtor shall be left to
      die of starvation and nakedness. This is no fiction. Not a week passes
      over our head, but, in every one of our prisons for debt, some of these
      men must inevitably expire in the slow agonies of want, if they were not
      relieved by their fellow-prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning these things in his mind, as he mounted the narrow staircase at
      the foot of which Roker had left him, Mr. Pickwick gradually worked
      himself to the boiling-over point; and so excited was he with his
      reflections on this subject, that he had burst into the room to which he
      had been directed, before he had any distinct recollection, either of the
      place in which he was, or of the object of his visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general aspect of the room recalled him to himself at once; but he had
      no sooner cast his eye on the figure of a man who was brooding over the
      dusty fire, than, letting his hat fall on the floor, he stood perfectly
      fixed and immovable with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; in tattered garments, and without a coat; his common calico shirt,
      yellow and in rags; his hair hanging over his face; his features changed
      with suffering, and pinched with famine&mdash;there sat Mr. Alfred Jingle;
      his head resting on his hands, his eyes fixed upon the fire, and his whole
      appearance denoting misery and dejection!
    </p>
    <p>
      Near him, leaning listlessly against the wall, stood a strong-built
      countryman, flicking with a worn-out hunting-whip the top-boot that
      adorned his right foot; his left being thrust into an old slipper. Horses,
      dogs, and drink had brought him there, pell-mell. There was a rusty spur
      on the solitary boot, which he occasionally jerked into the empty air, at
      the same time giving the boot a smart blow, and muttering some of the
      sounds by which a sportsman encourages his horse. He was riding, in
      imagination, some desperate steeplechase at that moment. Poor wretch! He
      never rode a match on the swiftest animal in his costly stud, with half
      the speed at which he had torn along the course that ended in the Fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the opposite side of the room an old man was seated on a small wooden
      box, with his eyes riveted on the floor, and his face settled into an
      expression of the deepest and most hopeless despair. A young girl&mdash;his
      little grand-daughter&mdash;was hanging about him, endeavouring, with a
      thousand childish devices, to engage his attention; but the old man
      neither saw nor heard her. The voice that had been music to him, and the
      eyes that had been light, fell coldly on his senses. His limbs were
      shaking with disease, and the palsy had fastened on his mind.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/20261m.jpg" alt="20261m " /><br />

      <a href="images/20261.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      There were two or three other men in the room, congregated in a little
      knot, and noiselessly talking among themselves. There was a lean and
      haggard woman, too&mdash;a prisoner&rsquo;s wife&mdash;who was watering, with
      great solicitude, the wretched stump of a dried-up, withered plant, which,
      it was plain to see, could never send forth a green leaf again&mdash;too
      true an emblem, perhaps, of the office she had come there to discharge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the objects which presented themselves to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s view,
      as he looked round him in amazement. The noise of some one stumbling
      hastily into the room, roused him. Turning his eyes towards the door, they
      encountered the new-comer; and in him, through his rags and dirt, he
      recognised the familiar features of Mr. Job Trotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick!&rsquo; exclaimed Job aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; said Jingle, starting from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr &mdash;&mdash;! So it is&mdash;queer place&mdash;strange things&mdash;serves
      me right&mdash;very.&rsquo; Mr. Jingle thrust his hands into the place where his
      trousers pockets used to be, and, dropping his chin upon his breast, sank
      back into his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was affected; the two men looked so very miserable. The
      sharp, involuntary glance Jingle had cast at a small piece of raw loin of
      mutton, which Job had brought in with him, said more of their reduced
      state than two hours&rsquo; explanation could have done. Mr. Pickwick looked
      mildly at Jingle, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to speak to you in private. Will you step out for an
      instant?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said Jingle, rising hastily. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t step far&mdash;no danger
      of overwalking yourself here&mdash;spike park&mdash;grounds pretty&mdash;romantic,
      but not extensive&mdash;open for public inspection&mdash;family always in
      town&mdash;housekeeper desperately careful&mdash;very.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have forgotten your coat,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as they walked out to
      the staircase, and closed the door after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; said Jingle. &lsquo;Spout&mdash;dear relation&mdash;uncle Tom&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t
      help it&mdash;must eat, you know. Wants of nature&mdash;and all that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gone, my dear sir&mdash;last coat&mdash;can&rsquo;t help it. Lived on a pair of
      boots, whole fortnight. Silk umbrella&mdash;ivory handle&mdash;week&mdash;fact&mdash;honour&mdash;ask
      Job&mdash;knows it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lived for three weeks upon a pair of boots, and a silk umbrella with an
      ivory handle!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, who had only heard of such things
      in shipwrecks or read of them in Constable&rsquo;s Miscellany.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True,&rsquo; said Jingle, nodding his head. &lsquo;Pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop&mdash;duplicates
      here&mdash;small sums&mdash;mere nothing&mdash;all rascals.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, much relieved by this explanation; &lsquo;I understand
      you. You have pawned your wardrobe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everything&mdash;Job&rsquo;s too&mdash;all shirts gone&mdash;never mind&mdash;saves
      washing. Nothing soon&mdash;lie in bed&mdash;starve&mdash;die&mdash;inquest&mdash;little
      bone-house&mdash;poor prisoner&mdash;common necessaries&mdash;hush it up&mdash;gentlemen
      of the jury&mdash;warden&rsquo;s tradesmen&mdash;keep it snug&mdash;natural
      death&mdash;coroner&rsquo;s order&mdash;workhouse funeral&mdash;serve him right&mdash;all
      over&mdash;drop the curtain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jingle delivered this singular summary of his prospects in life, with his
      accustomed volubility, and with various twitches of the countenance to
      counterfeit smiles. Mr. Pickwick easily perceived that his recklessness
      was assumed, and looking him full, but not unkindly, in the face, saw that
      his eyes were moist with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good fellow,&rsquo; said Jingle, pressing his hand, and turning his head away.
      &lsquo;Ungrateful dog&mdash;boyish to cry&mdash;can&rsquo;t help it&mdash;bad fever&mdash;weak&mdash;ill&mdash;hungry.
      Deserved it all&mdash;but suffered much&mdash;very.&rsquo; Wholly unable to keep
      up appearances any longer, and perhaps rendered worse by the effort he had
      made, the dejected stroller sat down on the stairs, and, covering his face
      with his hands, sobbed like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with considerable emotion, &lsquo;we will see
      what can be done, when I know all about the matter. Here, Job; where is
      that fellow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, sir,&rsquo; replied Job, presenting himself on the staircase. We have
      described him, by the bye, as having deeply-sunken eyes, in the best of
      times. In his present state of want and distress, he looked as if those
      features had gone out of town altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, sir,&rsquo; cried Job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come here, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, trying to look stern, with four large
      tears running down his waistcoat. &lsquo;Take that, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Take what? In the ordinary acceptation of such language, it should have
      been a blow. As the world runs, it ought to have been a sound, hearty
      cuff; for Mr. Pickwick had been duped, deceived, and wronged by the
      destitute outcast who was now wholly in his power. Must we tell the truth?
      It was something from Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s waistcoat pocket, which chinked as it
      was given into Job&rsquo;s hand, and the giving of which, somehow or other
      imparted a sparkle to the eye, and a swelling to the heart, of our
      excellent old friend, as he hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam had returned when Mr. Pickwick reached his own room, and was
      inspecting the arrangements that had been made for his comfort, with a
      kind of grim satisfaction which was very pleasant to look upon. Having a
      decided objection to his master&rsquo;s being there at all, Mr. Weller appeared
      to consider it a high moral duty not to appear too much pleased with
      anything that was done, said, suggested, or proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty comfortable now, eh, Sam?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty vell, sir,&rsquo; responded Sam, looking round him in a disparaging
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you seen Mr. Tupman and our other friends?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I <i>have </i>seen &lsquo;em, sir, and they&rsquo;re a-comin&rsquo; to-morrow, and wos
      wery much surprised to hear they warn&rsquo;t to come to-day,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have brought the things I wanted?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller in reply pointed to various packages which he had arranged, as
      neatly as he could, in a corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, after a little hesitation; &lsquo;listen to
      what I am going to say, Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cert&rsquo;nly, Sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Weller; &lsquo;fire away, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have felt from the first, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with much solemnity,
      &lsquo;that this is not the place to bring a young man to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor an old &lsquo;un neither, Sir,&rsquo; observed Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re quite right, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;but old men may come here
      through their own heedlessness and unsuspicion, and young men may be
      brought here by the selfishness of those they serve. It is better for
      those young men, in every point of view, that they should not remain here.
      Do you understand me, Sam?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vy no, Sir, I do <i>not</i>,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Try, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Sam, after a short pause, &lsquo;I think I see your drift;
      and if I do see your drift, it&rsquo;s my &lsquo;pinion that you&rsquo;re a-comin&rsquo; it a
      great deal too strong, as the mail-coachman said to the snowstorm, ven it
      overtook him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see you comprehend me, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Independently of my
      wish that you should not be idling about a place like this, for years to
      come, I feel that for a debtor in the Fleet to be attended by his
      manservant is a monstrous absurdity. Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;for a time
      you must leave me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, for a time, eh, sir?&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Weller rather sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, for the time that I remain here,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Your wages I
      shall continue to pay. Any one of my three friends will be happy to take
      you, were it only out of respect to me. And if I ever do leave this place,
      Sam,&rsquo; added Mr. Pickwick, with assumed cheerfulness&mdash;&lsquo;if I do, I
      pledge you my word that you shall return to me instantly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I&rsquo;ll tell you wot it is, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, in a grave and solemn
      voice. &lsquo;This here sort o&rsquo; thing won&rsquo;t do at all, so don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s hear no
      more about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am serious, and resolved, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You air, air you, sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller firmly. &lsquo;Wery good, Sir; then
      so am I.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus speaking, Mr. Weller fixed his hat on his head with great precision,
      and abruptly left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam!&rsquo; cried Mr. Pickwick, calling after him, &lsquo;Sam! Here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the long gallery ceased to re-echo the sound of footsteps. Sam Weller
      was gone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII. SHOWING HOW MR. SAMUEL WELLER GOT INTO DIFFICULTIES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n a lofty room,
      ill-lighted and worse ventilated, situated in Portugal Street, Lincoln&rsquo;s
      Inn Fields, there sit nearly the whole year round, one, two, three, or
      four gentlemen in wigs, as the case may be, with little writing-desks
      before them, constructed after the fashion of those used by the judges of
      the land, barring the French polish. There is a box of barristers on their
      right hand; there is an enclosure of insolvent debtors on their left; and
      there is an inclined plane of most especially dirty faces in their front.
      These gentlemen are the Commissioners of the Insolvent Court, and the
      place in which they sit, is the Insolvent Court itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, and has been, time out of mind, the remarkable fate of this court
      to be, somehow or other, held and understood, by the general consent of
      all the destitute shabby-genteel people in London, as their common resort,
      and place of daily refuge. It is always full. The steams of beer and
      spirits perpetually ascend to the ceiling, and, being condensed by the
      heat, roll down the walls like rain; there are more old suits of clothes
      in it at one time, than will be offered for sale in all Houndsditch in a
      twelvemonth; more unwashed skins and grizzly beards than all the pumps and
      shaving-shops between Tyburn and Whitechapel could render decent, between
      sunrise and sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be supposed that any of these people have the least shadow of
      business in, or the remotest connection with, the place they so
      indefatigably attend. If they had, it would be no matter of surprise, and
      the singularity of the thing would cease. Some of them sleep during the
      greater part of the sitting; others carry small portable dinners wrapped
      in pocket-handkerchiefs or sticking out of their worn-out pockets, and
      munch and listen with equal relish; but no one among them was ever known
      to have the slightest personal interest in any case that was ever brought
      forward. Whatever they do, there they sit from the first moment to the
      last. When it is heavy, rainy weather, they all come in, wet through; and
      at such times the vapours of the court are like those of a fungus-pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      A casual visitor might suppose this place to be a temple dedicated to the
      Genius of Seediness. There is not a messenger or process-server attached
      to it, who wears a coat that was made for him; not a tolerably fresh, or
      wholesome-looking man in the whole establishment, except a little
      white-headed apple-faced tipstaff, and even he, like an ill-conditioned
      cherry preserved in brandy, seems to have artificially dried and withered
      up into a state of preservation to which he can lay no natural claim. The
      very barristers&rsquo; wigs are ill-powdered, and their curls lack crispness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the attorneys, who sit at a large bare table below the commissioners,
      are, after all, the greatest curiosities. The professional establishment
      of the more opulent of these gentlemen, consists of a blue bag and a boy;
      generally a youth of the Jewish persuasion. They have no fixed offices,
      their legal business being transacted in the parlours of public-houses, or
      the yards of prisons, whither they repair in crowds, and canvass for
      customers after the manner of omnibus cads. They are of a greasy and
      mildewed appearance; and if they can be said to have any vices at all,
      perhaps drinking and cheating are the most conspicuous among them. Their
      residences are usually on the outskirts of &lsquo;the Rules,&rsquo; chiefly lying
      within a circle of one mile from the obelisk in St. George&rsquo;s Fields. Their
      looks are not prepossessing, and their manners are peculiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Solomon Pell, one of this learned body, was a fat, flabby, pale man,
      in a surtout which looked green one minute, and brown the next, with a
      velvet collar of the same chameleon tints. His forehead was narrow, his
      face wide, his head large, and his nose all on one side, as if Nature,
      indignant with the propensities she observed in him in his birth, had
      given it an angry tweak which it had never recovered. Being short-necked
      and asthmatic, however, he respired principally through this feature; so,
      perhaps, what it wanted in ornament, it made up in usefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure to bring him through it,&rsquo; said Mr. Pell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you, though?&rsquo; replied the person to whom the assurance was pledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certain sure,&rsquo; replied Pell; &lsquo;but if he&rsquo;d gone to any irregular
      practitioner, mind you, I wouldn&rsquo;t have answered for the consequences.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the other, with open mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, that I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Mr. Pell; and he pursed up his lips, frowned,
      and shook his head mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the place where this discourse occurred was the public-house just
      opposite to the Insolvent Court; and the person with whom it was held was
      no other than the elder Mr. Weller, who had come there, to comfort and
      console a friend, whose petition to be discharged under the act, was to be
      that day heard, and whose attorney he was at that moment consulting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And vere is George?&rsquo; inquired the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pell jerked his head in the direction of a back parlour, whither Mr.
      Weller at once repairing, was immediately greeted in the warmest and most
      flattering manner by some half-dozen of his professional brethren, in
      token of their gratification at his arrival. The insolvent gentleman, who
      had contracted a speculative but imprudent passion for horsing long
      stages, which had led to his present embarrassments, looked extremely
      well, and was soothing the excitement of his feelings with shrimps and
      porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The salutation between Mr. Weller and his friends was strictly confined to
      the freemasonry of the craft; consisting of a jerking round of the right
      wrist, and a tossing of the little finger into the air at the same time.
      We once knew two famous coachmen (they are dead now, poor fellows) who
      were twins, and between whom an unaffected and devoted attachment existed.
      They passed each other on the Dover road, every day, for twenty-four
      years, never exchanging any other greeting than this; and yet, when one
      died, the other pined away, and soon afterwards followed him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell, George,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller senior, taking off his upper coat, and
      seating himself with his accustomed gravity. &lsquo;How is it? All right behind,
      and full inside?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, old feller,&rsquo; replied the embarrassed gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is the gray mare made over to anybody?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      George nodded in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell, that&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Coach taken care on, also?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Con-signed in a safe quarter,&rsquo; replied George, wringing the heads off
      half a dozen shrimps, and swallowing them without any more ado.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good, wery good,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Alvays see to the drag ven you
      go downhill. Is the vay-bill all clear and straight for&rsquo;erd?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The schedule, sir,&rsquo; said Pell, guessing at Mr. Weller&rsquo;s meaning, &lsquo;the
      schedule is as plain and satisfactory as pen and ink can make it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller nodded in a manner which bespoke his inward approval of these
      arrangements; and then, turning to Mr. Pell, said, pointing to his friend
      George&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ven do you take his cloths off?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pell, &lsquo;he stands third on the opposed list, and I
      should think it would be his turn in about half an hour. I told my clerk
      to come over and tell us when there was a chance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller surveyed the attorney from head to foot with great admiration,
      and said emphatically&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what&rsquo;ll you take, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, really,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pell, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re very&mdash;. Upon my word and
      honour, I&rsquo;m not in the habit of&mdash;. It&rsquo;s so very early in the morning,
      that, actually, I am almost&mdash;. Well, you may bring me threepenn&rsquo;orth
      of rum, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The officiating damsel, who had anticipated the order before it was given,
      set the glass of spirits before Pell, and retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mr. Pell, looking round upon the company, &lsquo;success to
      your friend! I don&rsquo;t like to boast, gentlemen; it&rsquo;s not my way; but I
      can&rsquo;t help saying, that, if your friend hadn&rsquo;t been fortunate enough to
      fall into hands that&mdash;But I won&rsquo;t say what I was going to say.
      Gentlemen, my service to you.&rsquo; Having emptied the glass in a twinkling,
      Mr. Pell smacked his lips, and looked complacently round on the assembled
      coachmen, who evidently regarded him as a species of divinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me see,&rsquo; said the legal authority. &lsquo;What was I a-saying, gentlemen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you was remarkin&rsquo; as you wouldn&rsquo;t have no objection to another o&rsquo; 
      the same, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, with grave facetiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha, ha!&rsquo; laughed Mr. Pell. &lsquo;Not bad, not bad. A professional man, too! At
      this time of the morning, it would be rather too good a&mdash;Well, I
      don&rsquo;t know, my dear&mdash;you may do that again, if you please. Hem!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This last sound was a solemn and dignified cough, in which Mr. Pell,
      observing an indecent tendency to mirth in some of his auditors,
      considered it due to himself to indulge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The late Lord Chancellor, gentlemen, was very fond of me,&rsquo; said Mr. Pell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And wery creditable in him, too,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear, hear,&rsquo; assented Mr. Pell&rsquo;s client. &lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t he be?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Why, indeed!&rsquo; said a very red-faced man, who had said nothing yet,
      and who looked extremely unlikely to say anything more. &lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t
      he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of assent ran through the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I remember, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mr. Pell, &lsquo;dining with him on one occasion;
      there was only us two, but everything as splendid as if twenty people had
      been expected&mdash;the great seal on a dumb-waiter at his right hand, and
      a man in a bag-wig and suit of armour guarding the mace with a drawn sword
      and silk stockings&mdash;which is perpetually done, gentlemen, night and
      day; when he said, &ldquo;Pell,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no false delicacy, Pell. You&rsquo;re a man
      of talent; you can get anybody through the Insolvent Court, Pell; and your
      country should be proud of you.&rdquo; Those were his very words. &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; I
      said, &ldquo;you flatter me.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Pell,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I do, I&rsquo;m damned.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he say that?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He did,&rsquo; replied Pell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell, then,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, &lsquo;I say Parliament ought to ha&rsquo; took it up;
      and if he&rsquo;d been a poor man, they would ha&rsquo; done it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, my dear friend,&rsquo; argued Mr. Pell, &lsquo;it was in confidence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In what?&rsquo; said Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In confidence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! wery good,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, after a little reflection. &lsquo;If he
      damned hisself in confidence, o&rsquo; course that was another thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it was,&rsquo; said Mr. Pell. &lsquo;The distinction&rsquo;s obvious, you will
      perceive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alters the case entirely,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Go on, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I will not go on, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pell, in a low and serious tone. &lsquo;You
      have reminded me, Sir, that this conversation was private&mdash;private
      and confidential, gentlemen. Gentlemen, I am a professional man. It may be
      that I am a good deal looked up to, in my profession&mdash;it may be that
      I am not. Most people know. I say nothing. Observations have already been
      made, in this room, injurious to the reputation of my noble friend. You
      will excuse me, gentlemen; I was imprudent. I feel that I have no right to
      mention this matter without his concurrence. Thank you, Sir; thank you.&rsquo; 
      Thus delivering himself, Mr. Pell thrust his hands into his pockets, and,
      frowning grimly around, rattled three halfpence with terrible
      determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      This virtuous resolution had scarcely been formed, when the boy and the
      blue bag, who were inseparable companions, rushed violently into the room,
      and said (at least the boy did, for the blue bag took no part in the
      announcement) that the case was coming on directly. The intelligence was
      no sooner received than the whole party hurried across the street, and
      began to fight their way into court&mdash;a preparatory ceremony, which
      has been calculated to occupy, in ordinary cases, from twenty-five minutes
      to thirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller, being stout, cast himself at once into the crowd, with the
      desperate hope of ultimately turning up in some place which would suit
      him. His success was not quite equal to his expectations; for having
      neglected to take his hat off, it was knocked over his eyes by some unseen
      person, upon whose toes he had alighted with considerable force.
      Apparently this individual regretted his impetuosity immediately
      afterwards, for, muttering an indistinct exclamation of surprise, he
      dragged the old man out into the hall, and, after a violent struggle,
      released his head and face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Samivel!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Weller, when he was thus enabled to behold his
      rescuer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a dutiful and affectionate little boy, you are, ain&rsquo;t you,&rsquo; said
      Mr. Weller, &lsquo;to come a-bonnetin&rsquo; your father in his old age?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How should I know who you wos?&rsquo; responded the son. &lsquo;Do you s&rsquo;pose I wos
      to tell you by the weight o&rsquo; your foot?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell, that&rsquo;s wery true, Sammy,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, mollified at once;
      &lsquo;but wot are you a-doin&rsquo; on here? Your gov&rsquo;nor can&rsquo;t do no good here,
      Sammy. They won&rsquo;t pass that werdick, they won&rsquo;t pass it, Sammy.&rsquo; And Mr.
      Weller shook his head with legal solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot a perwerse old file it is!&rsquo; exclaimed Sam, &lsquo;always a-goin&rsquo; on about
      werdicks and alleybis and that. Who said anything about the werdick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller made no reply, but once more shook his head most learnedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave off rattlin&rsquo; that &lsquo;ere nob o&rsquo; yourn, if you don&rsquo;t want it to come
      off the springs altogether,&rsquo; said Sam impatiently, &lsquo;and behave reasonable.
      I vent all the vay down to the Markis o&rsquo; Granby, arter you, last night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you see the Marchioness o&rsquo; Granby, Sammy?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller, with
      a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I did,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How wos the dear creetur a-lookin&rsquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery queer,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;I think she&rsquo;s a-injurin&rsquo; herself gradivally vith
      too much o&rsquo; that &lsquo;ere pine-apple rum, and other strong medicines of the
      same natur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that, Sammy?&rsquo; said the senior earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do, indeed,&rsquo; replied the junior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller seized his son&rsquo;s hand, clasped it, and let it fall. There was
      an expression on his countenance in doing so&mdash;not of dismay or
      apprehension, but partaking more of the sweet and gentle character of
      hope. A gleam of resignation, and even of cheerfulness, passed over his
      face too, as he slowly said, &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t quite certain, Sammy; I wouldn&rsquo;t
      like to say I wos altogether positive, in case of any subsekent
      disappointment, but I rayther think, my boy, I rayther think, that the
      shepherd&rsquo;s got the liver complaint!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does he look bad?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s uncommon pale,&rsquo; replied his father, &lsquo;&rsquo;cept about the nose, which is
      redder than ever. His appetite is wery so-so, but he imbibes wonderful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some thoughts of the rum appeared to obtrude themselves on Mr. Weller&rsquo;s
      mind, as he said this; for he looked gloomy and thoughtful; but he very
      shortly recovered, as was testified by a perfect alphabet of winks, in
      which he was only wont to indulge when particularly pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell, now,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;about my affair. Just open them ears o&rsquo; yourn, and
      don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; till I&rsquo;ve done.&rsquo; With this preface, Sam related, as
      succinctly as he could, the last memorable conversation he had had with
      Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop there by himself, poor creetur!&rsquo; exclaimed the elder Mr. Weller,
      &lsquo;without nobody to take his part! It can&rsquo;t be done, Samivel, it can&rsquo;t be
      done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O&rsquo; course it can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; asserted Sam: &lsquo;I know&rsquo;d that, afore I came.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, they&rsquo;ll eat him up alive, Sammy,&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam nodded his concurrence in the opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He goes in rayther raw, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller metaphorically, &lsquo;and
      he&rsquo;ll come out, done so ex-ceedin&rsquo; brown, that his most formiliar friends
      won&rsquo;t know him. Roast pigeon&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; to it, Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Sam Weller nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It oughtn&rsquo;t to be, Samivel,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It mustn&rsquo;t be,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cert&rsquo;nly not,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell now,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve been a-prophecyin&rsquo; away, wery fine, like a
      red-faced Nixon, as the sixpenny books gives picters on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who wos he, Sammy?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind who he was,&rsquo; retorted Sam; &lsquo;he warn&rsquo;t a coachman; that&rsquo;s
      enough for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I know&rsquo;d a ostler o&rsquo; that name,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, musing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It warn&rsquo;t him,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;This here gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n was a prophet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s a prophet?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller, looking sternly on his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wy, a man as tells what&rsquo;s a-goin&rsquo; to happen,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I&rsquo;d know&rsquo;d him, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller. &lsquo;P&rsquo;raps he might ha&rsquo; 
      throw&rsquo;d a small light on that &lsquo;ere liver complaint as we wos a-speakin&rsquo; 
      on, just now. Hows&rsquo;ever, if he&rsquo;s dead, and ain&rsquo;t left the bisness to
      nobody, there&rsquo;s an end on it. Go on, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve been a-prophecyin&rsquo; avay about wot&rsquo;ll happen to
      the gov&rsquo;ner if he&rsquo;s left alone. Don&rsquo;t you see any way o&rsquo; takin&rsquo; care on
      him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, with a reflective visage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No vay at all?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No vay,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, &lsquo;unless&rsquo;&mdash;and a gleam of intelligence
      lighted up his countenance as he sank his voice to a whisper, and applied
      his mouth to the ear of his offspring&mdash;&lsquo;unless it is getting him out
      in a turn-up bedstead, unbeknown to the turnkeys, Sammy, or dressin&rsquo; him
      up like a old &lsquo;ooman vith a green wail.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam Weller received both of these suggestions with unexpected contempt,
      and again propounded his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the old gentleman; &lsquo;if he von&rsquo;t let you stop there, I see no
      vay at all. It&rsquo;s no thoroughfare, Sammy, no thoroughfare.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll tell you wot it is,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll trouble you for the
      loan of five-and-twenty pound.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot good&rsquo;ll that do?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;P&rsquo;raps you may ask for it five minits
      arterwards; p&rsquo;raps I may say I von&rsquo;t pay, and cut up rough. You von&rsquo;t
      think o&rsquo; arrestin&rsquo; your own son for the money, and sendin&rsquo; him off to the
      Fleet, will you, you unnat&rsquo;ral wagabone?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this reply of Sam&rsquo;s, the father and son exchanged a complete code of
      telegraph nods and gestures, after which, the elder Mr. Weller sat himself
      down on a stone step and laughed till he was purple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot a old image it is!&rsquo; exclaimed Sam, indignant at this loss of time.
      &lsquo;What are you a-settin&rsquo; down there for, con-wertin&rsquo; your face into a
      street-door knocker, wen there&rsquo;s so much to be done. Where&rsquo;s the money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the boot, Sammy, in the boot,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, composing his
      features. &lsquo;Hold my hat, Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having divested himself of this encumbrance, Mr. Weller gave his body a
      sudden wrench to one side, and by a dexterous twist, contrived to get his
      right hand into a most capacious pocket, from whence, after a great deal
      of panting and exertion, he extricated a pocket-book of the large octavo
      size, fastened by a huge leathern strap. From this ledger he drew forth a
      couple of whiplashes, three or four buckles, a little sample-bag of corn,
      and, finally, a small roll of very dirty bank-notes, from which he
      selected the required amount, which he handed over to Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now, Sammy,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, when the whip-lashes, and the
      buckles, and the samples, had been all put back, and the book once more
      deposited at the bottom of the same pocket, &lsquo;now, Sammy, I know a
      gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n here, as&rsquo;ll do the rest o&rsquo; the bisness for us, in no time&mdash;a
      limb o&rsquo; the law, Sammy, as has got brains like the frogs, dispersed all
      over his body, and reachin&rsquo; to the wery tips of his fingers; a friend of
      the Lord Chancellorship&rsquo;s, Sammy, who&rsquo;d only have to tell him what he
      wanted, and he&rsquo;d lock you up for life, if that wos all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;none o&rsquo; that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None o&rsquo; wot?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wy, none o&rsquo; them unconstitootional ways o&rsquo; doin&rsquo; it,&rsquo; retorted Sam. &lsquo;The
      have-his-carcass, next to the perpetual motion, is vun of the blessedest
      things as wos ever made. I&rsquo;ve read that &lsquo;ere in the newspapers wery
      of&rsquo;en.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, wot&rsquo;s that got to do vith it?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just this here,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;that I&rsquo;ll patronise the inwention, and go in,
      that vay. No visperin&rsquo;s to the Chancellorship&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like the
      notion. It mayn&rsquo;t be altogether safe, vith reference to gettin&rsquo; out agin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Deferring to his son&rsquo;s feeling upon this point, Mr. Weller at once sought
      the erudite Solomon Pell, and acquainted him with his desire to issue a
      writ, instantly, for the <i>sum </i>of twenty-five pounds, and costs of
      process; to be executed without delay upon the body of one Samuel Weller;
      the charges thereby incurred, to be paid in advance to Solomon Pell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attorney was in high glee, for the embarrassed coach-horser was
      ordered to be discharged forthwith. He highly approved of Sam&rsquo;s attachment
      to his master; declared that it strongly reminded him of his own feelings
      of devotion to his friend, the Chancellor; and at once led the elder Mr.
      Weller down to the Temple, to swear the affidavit of debt, which the boy,
      with the assistance of the blue bag, had drawn up on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Sam, having been formally introduced to the whitewashed
      gentleman and his friends, as the offspring of Mr. Weller, of the Belle
      Savage, was treated with marked distinction, and invited to regale himself
      with them in honour of the occasion&mdash;an invitation which he was by no
      means backward in accepting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mirth of gentlemen of this class is of a grave and quiet character,
      usually; but the present instance was one of peculiar festivity, and they
      relaxed in proportion. After some rather tumultuous toasting of the Chief
      Commissioner and Mr. Solomon Pell, who had that day displayed such
      transcendent abilities, a mottled-faced gentleman in a blue shawl proposed
      that somebody should sing a song. The obvious suggestion was, that the
      mottled-faced gentleman, being anxious for a song, should sing it himself;
      but this the mottled-faced gentleman sturdily, and somewhat offensively,
      declined to do. Upon which, as is not unusual in such cases, a rather
      angry colloquy ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; said the coach-horser, &lsquo;rather than disturb the harmony of
      this delightful occasion, perhaps Mr. Samuel Weller will oblige the
      company.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Raly, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not wery much in the habit o&rsquo; singin&rsquo; 
      without the instrument; but anythin&rsquo; for a quiet life, as the man said wen
      he took the sitivation at the lighthouse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this prelude, Mr. Samuel Weller burst at once into the following wild
      and beautiful legend, which, under the impression that it is not generally
      known, we take the liberty of quoting. We would beg to call particular
      attention to the monosyllable at the end of the second and fourth lines,
      which not only enables the singer to take breath at those points, but
      greatly assists the metre.

          ROMANCE

       I

     Bold Turpin vunce, on Hounslow Heath,
     His bold mare Bess bestrode&mdash;er;
     Ven there he see&rsquo;d the Bishop&rsquo;s coach
     A-coming along the road&mdash;er.
     So he gallops close to the &lsquo;orse&rsquo;s legs,
     And he claps his head vithin;
     And the Bishop says, &lsquo;Sure as eggs is eggs,
     This here&rsquo;s the bold Turpin!&rsquo; 

               CHORUS

     And the Bishop says, &lsquo;Sure as eggs is eggs,
     This here&rsquo;s the bold Turpin!&rsquo; 

       II

     Says Turpin, &lsquo;You shall eat your words,
     With a sarse of leaden bul&mdash;let;&rsquo; 
     So he puts a pistol to his mouth,
     And he fires it down his gul&mdash;let.
     The coachman he not likin&rsquo; the job,
     Set off at full gal-lop,
     But Dick put a couple of balls in his nob,
     And perwailed on him to stop.

          CHORUS (sarcastically)

     But Dick put a couple of balls in his nob,
     And perwailed on him to stop.

    <p>
      &lsquo;I maintain that that &lsquo;ere song&rsquo;s personal to the cloth,&rsquo; said the
      mottled-faced gentleman, interrupting it at this point. &lsquo;I demand the name
      o&rsquo; that coachman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody know&rsquo;d,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;He hadn&rsquo;t got his card in his pocket.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I object to the introduction o&rsquo; politics,&rsquo; said the mottled-faced
      gentleman. &lsquo;I submit that, in the present company, that &lsquo;ere song&rsquo;s
      political; and, wot&rsquo;s much the same, that it ain&rsquo;t true. I say that that
      coachman did not run away; but that he died game&mdash;game as pheasants;
      and I won&rsquo;t hear nothin&rsquo; said to the contrairey.&rsquo; 
    </p>

      As the mottled-faced gentleman spoke with great energy and determination,
      and as the opinions of the company seemed divided on the subject, it
      threatened to give rise to fresh altercation, when Mr. Weller and Mr. Pell
      most opportunely arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The officer will be here at four o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; said Mr. Pell. &lsquo;I suppose you
      won&rsquo;t run away meanwhile, eh? Ha! ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;P&rsquo;raps my cruel pa &lsquo;ull relent afore then,&rsquo; replied Sam, with a broad
      grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; said the elder Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not on no account,&rsquo; replied the inexorable creditor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give bills for the amount, at sixpence a month,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t take &lsquo;em,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha, ha, ha! very good, very good,&rsquo; said Mr. Solomon Pell, who was making
      out his little bill of costs; &lsquo;a very amusing incident indeed! Benjamin,
      copy that.&rsquo; And Mr. Pell smiled again, as he called Mr. Weller&rsquo;s attention
      to the amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, thank you,&rsquo; said the professional gentleman, taking up another
      of the greasy notes as Mr. Weller took it from the pocket-book. &lsquo;Three ten
      and one ten is five. Much obliged to you, Mr. Weller. Your son is a most
      deserving young man, very much so indeed, Sir. It&rsquo;s a very pleasant trait
      in a young man&rsquo;s character, very much so,&rsquo; added Mr. Pell, smiling
      smoothly round, as he buttoned up the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot a game it is!&rsquo; said the elder Mr. Weller, with a chuckle. &lsquo;A reg&rsquo;lar
      prodigy son!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Prodigal&mdash;prodigal son, Sir,&rsquo; suggested Mr. Pell, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, with dignity. &lsquo;I know wot&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock,
      Sir. Wen I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll ask you, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the officer arrived, Sam had made himself so extremely
      popular, that the congregated gentlemen determined to see him to prison in
      a body. So off they set; the plaintiff and defendant walking arm in arm,
      the officer in front, and eight stout coachmen bringing up the rear. At
      Serjeant&rsquo;s Inn Coffee-house the whole party halted to refresh, and, the
      legal arrangements being completed, the procession moved on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some little commotion was occasioned in Fleet Street, by the pleasantry of
      the eight gentlemen in the flank, who persevered in walking four abreast;
      it was also found necessary to leave the mottled-faced gentleman behind,
      to fight a ticket-porter, it being arranged that his friends should call
      for him as they came back. Nothing but these little incidents occurred on
      the way. When they reached the gate of the Fleet, the cavalcade, taking
      the time from the plaintiff, gave three tremendous cheers for the
      defendant, and, after having shaken hands all round, left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam, having been formally delivered into the warder&rsquo;s custody, to the
      intense astonishment of Roker, and to the evident emotion of even the
      phlegmatic Neddy, passed at once into the prison, walked straight to his
      master&rsquo;s room, and knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam appeared, pulled off his hat, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Sam, my good lad!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, evidently delighted to see his
      humble friend again; &lsquo;I had no intention of hurting your feelings
      yesterday, my faithful fellow, by what I said. Put down your hat, Sam, and
      let me explain my meaning, a little more at length.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t presently do, sir?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;but why not now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rayther not now, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Cause&mdash;&rsquo; said Sam, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because of what?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, alarmed at his follower&rsquo;s
      manner. &lsquo;Speak out, Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Cause,&rsquo; rejoined Sam&mdash;&lsquo;&rsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve got a little bisness as I want
      to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What business?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, surprised at Sam&rsquo;s confused
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothin&rsquo; partickler, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, if it&rsquo;s nothing particular,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with a smile, &lsquo;you
      can speak with me first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;d better see arter it at once,&rsquo; said Sam, still hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick looked amazed, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fact is&mdash;&rsquo; said Sam, stopping short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Speak out, Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, the fact is,&rsquo; said Sam, with a desperate effort, &lsquo;perhaps I&rsquo;d better
      see arter my bed afore I do anythin&rsquo; else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Your bed!</i>&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my bed, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a prisoner. I was arrested this here
      wery arternoon for debt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You arrested for debt!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, sinking into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, for debt, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;And the man as puts me in, &lsquo;ull never
      let me out till you go yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless my heart and soul!&rsquo; ejaculated Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot I say, Sir,&rsquo; rejoined Sam. &lsquo;If it&rsquo;s forty years to come, I shall be a
      prisoner, and I&rsquo;m very glad on it; and if it had been Newgate, it would
      ha&rsquo; been just the same. Now the murder&rsquo;s out, and, damme, there&rsquo;s an end
      on it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, which he repeated with great emphasis and violence, Sam
      Weller dashed his hat upon the ground, in a most unusual state of
      excitement; and then, folding his arms, looked firmly and fixedly in his
      master&rsquo;s face.

      CHAPTER LXIV. TREATS OF DIVERS LITTLE MATTERS WHICH OCCURRED IN THE FLEET,
      AND OF MR. WINKLE&rsquo;S MYSTERIOUS BEHAVIOUR; AND SHOWS HOW THE POOR CHANCERY
      PRISONER OBTAINED HIS RELEASE AT LAST
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Pickwick felt a
      great deal too much touched by the warmth of Sam&rsquo;s attachment, to be able
      to exhibit any manifestation of anger or displeasure at the precipitate
      course he had adopted, in voluntarily consigning himself to a debtor&rsquo;s
      prison for an indefinite period. The only point on which he persevered in
      demanding an explanation, was, the name of Sam&rsquo;s detaining creditor; but
      this Mr. Weller as perseveringly withheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t o&rsquo; no use, sir,&rsquo; said Sam, again and again; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s a malicious,
      bad-disposed, vorldly-minded, spiteful, windictive creetur, with a hard
      heart as there ain&rsquo;t no soft&rsquo;nin&rsquo;, as the wirtuous clergyman remarked of
      the old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n with the dropsy, ven he said, that upon the whole he
      thought he&rsquo;d rayther leave his property to his vife than build a chapel
      vith it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But consider, Sam,&rsquo; Mr. Pickwick remonstrated, &lsquo;the sum is so small that
      it can very easily be paid; and having made up my mind that you shall stop
      with me, you should recollect how much more useful you would be, if you
      could go outside the walls.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Wery much obliged to you, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller gravely; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;d
      rayther not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather not do what, Sam?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wy, I&rsquo;d rayther not let myself down to ask a favour o&rsquo; this here
      unremorseful enemy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it is no favour asking him to take his money, Sam,&rsquo; reasoned Mr.
      Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beg your pardon, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Sam, &lsquo;but it &lsquo;ud be a wery great favour
      to pay it, and he don&rsquo;t deserve none; that&rsquo;s where it is, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Pickwick, rubbing his nose with an air of some vexation, Mr.
      Weller thought it prudent to change the theme of the discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I takes my determination on principle, Sir,&rsquo; remarked Sam, &lsquo;and you takes
      yours on the same ground; wich puts me in mind o&rsquo; the man as killed
      his-self on principle, wich o&rsquo; course you&rsquo;ve heerd on, Sir.&rsquo; Mr. Weller
      paused when he arrived at this point, and cast a comical look at his
      master out of the corners of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no &ldquo;of course&rdquo; in the case, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, gradually
      breaking into a smile, in spite of the uneasiness which Sam&rsquo;s obstinacy
      had given him. &lsquo;The fame of the gentleman in question, never reached my
      ears.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Weller. &lsquo;You astonish me, Sir; he wos a clerk in
      a gov&rsquo;ment office, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was he?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he wos, Sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Weller; &lsquo;and a wery pleasant gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n
      too&mdash;one o&rsquo; the precise and tidy sort, as puts their feet in little
      India-rubber fire-buckets wen it&rsquo;s wet weather, and never has no other
      bosom friends but hare-skins; he saved up his money on principle, wore a
      clean shirt ev&rsquo;ry day on principle; never spoke to none of his relations
      on principle, &lsquo;fear they shou&rsquo;d want to borrow money of him; and wos
      altogether, in fact, an uncommon agreeable character. He had his hair cut
      on principle vunce a fortnight, and contracted for his clothes on the
      economic principle&mdash;three suits a year, and send back the old uns.
      Being a wery reg&rsquo;lar gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, he din&rsquo;d ev&rsquo;ry day at the same place,
      where it was one-and-nine to cut off the joint, and a wery good
      one-and-nine&rsquo;s worth he used to cut, as the landlord often said, with the
      tears a-tricklin&rsquo; down his face, let alone the way he used to poke the
      fire in the vinter time, which wos a dead loss o&rsquo; four-pence ha&rsquo;penny a
      day, to say nothin&rsquo; at all o&rsquo; the aggrawation o&rsquo; seein&rsquo; him do it. So
      uncommon grand with it too! &ldquo;<i>Post </i>arter the next gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n,&rdquo; he
      sings out ev&rsquo;ry day ven he comes in. &ldquo;See arter the TIMES, Thomas; let me
      look at the MORNIN&rsquo; HERALD, when it&rsquo;s out o&rsquo; hand; don&rsquo;t forget to bespeak
      the CHRONICLE; and just bring the &lsquo;TIZER, vill you:&rdquo; and then he&rsquo;d set
      vith his eyes fixed on the clock, and rush out, just a quarter of a minit
      &lsquo;fore the time to waylay the boy as wos a-comin&rsquo; in with the evenin&rsquo; 
      paper, which he&rsquo;d read with sich intense interest and persewerance as
      worked the other customers up to the wery confines o&rsquo; desperation and
      insanity, &lsquo;specially one i-rascible old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n as the vaiter wos always
      obliged to keep a sharp eye on, at sich times, fear he should be tempted
      to commit some rash act with the carving-knife. Vell, Sir, here he&rsquo;d stop,
      occupyin&rsquo; the best place for three hours, and never takin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; arter
      his dinner, but sleep, and then he&rsquo;d go away to a coffee-house a few
      streets off, and have a small pot o&rsquo; coffee and four crumpets, arter wich
      he&rsquo;d walk home to Kensington and go to bed. One night he wos took very
      ill; sends for a doctor; doctor comes in a green fly, with a kind o&rsquo; 
      Robinson Crusoe set o&rsquo; steps, as he could let down wen he got out, and
      pull up arter him wen he got in, to perwent the necessity o&rsquo; the
      coachman&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; down, and thereby undeceivin&rsquo; the public by lettin&rsquo; &lsquo;em
      see that it wos only a livery coat as he&rsquo;d got on, and not the trousers to
      match. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; says the doctor. &ldquo;Wery ill,&rdquo; says the patient.
      &ldquo;Wot have you been a-eatin&rsquo; on?&rdquo; says the doctor. &ldquo;Roast weal,&rdquo; says the
      patient. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s the last thing you dewoured?&rdquo; says the doctor. &ldquo;Crumpets,&rdquo;
       says the patient. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; says the doctor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you a box of
      pills directly, and don&rsquo;t you never take no more of &lsquo;em,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;No
      more o&rsquo; wot?&rdquo; says the patient&mdash;&ldquo;pills?&rdquo; &ldquo;No; crumpets,&rdquo; says the
      doctor. &ldquo;Wy?&rdquo; says the patient, starting up in bed; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve eat four
      crumpets, ev&rsquo;ry night for fifteen year, on principle.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, then, you&rsquo;d
      better leave &lsquo;em off, on principle,&rdquo; says the doctor. &ldquo;Crumpets is <i>not
      </i>wholesome, Sir,&rdquo; says the doctor, wery fierce. &ldquo;But they&rsquo;re so cheap,&rdquo;
       says the patient, comin&rsquo; down a little, &ldquo;and so wery fillin&rsquo; at the
      price.&rdquo; &ldquo;They&rsquo;d be dear to you, at any price; dear if you wos paid to eat
      &lsquo;em,&rdquo; says the doctor. &ldquo;Four crumpets a night,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;vill do your
      business in six months!&rdquo; The patient looks him full in the face, and turns
      it over in his mind for a long time, and at last he says, &ldquo;Are you sure o&rsquo; 
      that &lsquo;ere, Sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stake my professional reputation on it,&rdquo; says the
      doctor. &ldquo;How many crumpets, at a sittin&rsquo;, do you think &lsquo;ud kill me off at
      once?&rdquo; says the patient. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; says the doctor. &ldquo;Do you think
      half-a-crown&rsquo;s wurth &lsquo;ud do it?&rdquo; says the patient. &ldquo;I think it might,&rdquo;
       says the doctor. &ldquo;Three shillins&rsquo; wurth &lsquo;ud be sure to do it, I s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo;
       says the patient. &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; says the doctor. &ldquo;Wery good,&rdquo; says the
      patient; &ldquo;good-night.&rdquo; Next mornin&rsquo; he gets up, has a fire lit, orders in
      three shillins&rsquo; wurth o&rsquo; crumpets, toasts &lsquo;em all, eats &lsquo;em all, and blows
      his brains out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did he do that for?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick abruptly; for he was
      considerably startled by this tragical termination of the narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot did he do it for, Sir?&rsquo; reiterated Sam. &lsquo;Wy, in support of his great
      principle that crumpets wos wholesome, and to show that he wouldn&rsquo;t be put
      out of his way for nobody!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With such like shiftings and changings of the discourse, did Mr. Weller
      meet his master&rsquo;s questioning on the night of his taking up his residence
      in the Fleet. Finding all gentle remonstrance useless, Mr. Pickwick at
      length yielded a reluctant consent to his taking lodgings by the week, of
      a bald-headed cobbler, who rented a small slip room in one of the upper
      galleries. To this humble apartment Mr. Weller moved a mattress and
      bedding, which he hired of Mr. Roker; and, by the time he lay down upon it
      at night, was as much at home as if he had been bred in the prison, and
      his whole family had vegetated therein for three generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you always smoke arter you goes to bed, old cock?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller
      of his landlord, when they had both retired for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I does, young bantam,&rsquo; replied the cobbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you allow me to in-quire wy you make up your bed under that &lsquo;ere
      deal table?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Cause I was always used to a four-poster afore I came here, and I find
      the legs of the table answer just as well,&rsquo; replied the cobbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a character, sir,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t got anything of the kind belonging to me,&rsquo; rejoined the
      cobbler, shaking his head; &lsquo;and if you want to meet with a good one, I&rsquo;m
      afraid you&rsquo;ll find some difficulty in suiting yourself at this register
      office.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The above short dialogue took place as Mr. Weller lay extended on his
      mattress at one end of the room, and the cobbler on his, at the other; the
      apartment being illumined by the light of a rush-candle, and the cobbler&rsquo;s
      pipe, which was glowing below the table, like a red-hot coal. The
      conversation, brief as it was, predisposed Mr. Weller strongly in his
      landlord&rsquo;s favour; and, raising himself on his elbow, he took a more
      lengthened survey of his appearance than he had yet had either time or
      inclination to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a sallow man&mdash;all cobblers are; and had a strong bristly beard&mdash;all
      cobblers have. His face was a queer, good-tempered, crooked-featured piece
      of workmanship, ornamented with a couple of eyes that must have worn a
      very joyous expression at one time, for they sparkled yet. The man was
      sixty, by years, and Heaven knows how old by imprisonment, so that his
      having any look approaching to mirth or contentment, was singular enough.
      He was a little man, and, being half doubled up as he lay in bed, looked
      about as long as he ought to have been without his legs. He had a great
      red pipe in his mouth, and was smoking, and staring at the rush-light, in
      a state of enviable placidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you been here long?&rsquo; inquired Sam, breaking the silence which had
      lasted for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twelve year,&rsquo; replied the cobbler, biting the end of his pipe as he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Contempt?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cobbler nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said Sam, with some sternness, &lsquo;wot do you persevere in
      bein&rsquo; obstinit for, vastin&rsquo; your precious life away, in this here
      magnified pound? Wy don&rsquo;t you give in, and tell the Chancellorship that
      you&rsquo;re wery sorry for makin&rsquo; his court contemptible, and you won&rsquo;t do so
      no more?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The cobbler put his pipe in the corner of his mouth, while he smiled, and
      then brought it back to its old place again; but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wy don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said Sam, urging his question strenuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the cobbler, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t quite understand these matters. What do
      you suppose ruined me, now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wy,&rsquo; said Sam, trimming the rush-light, &lsquo;I s&rsquo;pose the beginnin&rsquo; wos, that
      you got into debt, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never owed a farden,&rsquo; said the cobbler; &lsquo;try again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, perhaps,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;you bought houses, wich is delicate English
      for goin&rsquo; mad; or took to buildin&rsquo;, wich is a medical term for bein&rsquo; 
      incurable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The cobbler shook his head and said, &lsquo;Try again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t go to law, I hope?&rsquo; said Sam suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never in my life,&rsquo; replied the cobbler. &lsquo;The fact is, I was ruined by
      having money left me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;that von&rsquo;t do. I wish some rich enemy &lsquo;ud try to
      vork my destruction in that &lsquo;ere vay. I&rsquo;d let him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I dare say you don&rsquo;t believe it,&rsquo; said the cobbler, quietly smoking
      his pipe. &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t if I was you; but it&rsquo;s true for all that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How wos it?&rsquo; inquired Sam, half induced to believe the fact already, by
      the look the cobbler gave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just this,&rsquo; replied the cobbler; &lsquo;an old gentleman that I worked for,
      down in the country, and a humble relation of whose I married&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      dead, God bless her, and thank Him for it!&mdash;was seized with a fit and
      went off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where?&rsquo; inquired Sam, who was growing sleepy after the numerous events of
      the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How should I know where he went?&rsquo; said the cobbler, speaking through his
      nose in an intense enjoyment of his pipe. &lsquo;He went off dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that indeed,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the cobbler, &lsquo;he left five thousand pound behind him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And wery gen-teel in him so to do,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One of which,&rsquo; continued the cobbler, &lsquo;he left to me, &lsquo;cause I married
      his relation, you see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good,&rsquo; murmured Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And being surrounded by a great number of nieces and nevys, as was always
      quarrelling and fighting among themselves for the property, he makes me
      his executor, and leaves the rest to me in trust, to divide it among &lsquo;em
      as the will prowided.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot do you mean by leavin&rsquo; it on trust?&rsquo; inquired Sam, waking up a
      little. &lsquo;If it ain&rsquo;t ready-money, were&rsquo;s the use on it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a law term, that&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; said the cobbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think that,&rsquo; said Sam, shaking his head. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s wery little
      trust at that shop. Hows&rsquo;ever, go on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Well,&rsquo; said the cobbler, &lsquo;when I was going to take out a probate of the
      will, the nieces and nevys, who was desperately disappointed at not
      getting all the money, enters a caveat against it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A legal instrument, which is as much as to say, it&rsquo;s no go,&rsquo; replied the
      cobbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;a sort of brother-in-law o&rsquo; the have-his-carcass.
      Well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But,&rsquo; continued the cobbler, &lsquo;finding that they couldn&rsquo;t agree among
      themselves, and consequently couldn&rsquo;t get up a case against the will, they
      withdrew the caveat, and I paid all the legacies. I&rsquo;d hardly done it, when
      one nevy brings an action to set the will aside. The case comes on, some
      months afterwards, afore a deaf old gentleman, in a back room somewhere
      down by Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard; and arter four counsels had taken a day a-piece
      to bother him regularly, he takes a week or two to consider, and read the
      evidence in six volumes, and then gives his judgment that how the testator
      was not quite right in his head, and I must pay all the money back again,
      and all the costs. I appealed; the case come on before three or four very
      sleepy gentlemen, who had heard it all before in the other court, where
      they&rsquo;re lawyers without work; the only difference being, that, there,
      they&rsquo;re called doctors, and in the other place delegates, if you
      understand that; and they very dutifully confirmed the decision of the old
      gentleman below. After that, we went into Chancery, where we are still,
      and where I shall always be. My lawyers have had all my thousand pound
      long ago; and what between the estate, as they call it, and the costs, I&rsquo;m
      here for ten thousand, and shall stop here, till I die, mending shoes.
      Some gentlemen have talked of bringing it before Parliament, and I dare
      say would have done it, only they hadn&rsquo;t time to come to me, and I hadn&rsquo;t
      power to go to them, and they got tired of my long letters, and dropped
      the business. And this is God&rsquo;s truth, without one word of suppression or
      exaggeration, as fifty people, both in this place and out of it, very well
      know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The cobbler paused to ascertain what effect his story had produced on Sam;
      but finding that he had dropped asleep, knocked the ashes out of his pipe,
      sighed, put it down, drew the bed-clothes over his head, and went to
      sleep, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was sitting at breakfast, alone, next morning (Sam being
      busily engaged in the cobbler&rsquo;s room, polishing his master&rsquo;s shoes and
      brushing the black gaiters) when there came a knock at the door, which,
      before Mr. Pickwick could cry &lsquo;Come in!&rsquo; was followed by the appearance of
      a head of hair and a cotton-velvet cap, both of which articles of dress he
      had no difficulty in recognising as the personal property of Mr. Smangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo; said that worthy, accompanying the inquiry with a score or
      two of nods; &lsquo;I say&mdash;do you expect anybody this morning? Three men&mdash;devilish
      gentlemanly fellows&mdash;have been asking after you downstairs, and
      knocking at every door on the hall flight; for which they&rsquo;ve been most
      infernally blown up by the collegians that had the trouble of opening
      &lsquo;em.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me! How very foolish of them,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, rising. &lsquo;Yes; I
      have no doubt they are some friends whom I rather expected to see,
      yesterday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friends of yours!&rsquo; exclaimed Smangle, seizing Mr. Pickwick by the hand.
      &lsquo;Say no more. Curse me, they&rsquo;re friends of mine from this minute, and
      friends of Mivins&rsquo;s, too. Infernal pleasant, gentlemanly dog, Mivins,
      isn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; said Smangle, with great feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know so little of the gentleman,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, hesitating, &lsquo;that
      I&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know you do,&rsquo; interrupted Smangle, clasping Mr. Pickwick by the
      shoulder. &lsquo;You shall know him better. You&rsquo;ll be delighted with him. That
      man, Sir,&rsquo; said Smangle, with a solemn countenance, &lsquo;has comic powers that
      would do honour to Drury Lane Theatre.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he indeed?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, by Jove he has!&rsquo; replied Smangle. &lsquo;Hear him come the four cats in the
      wheel-barrow&mdash;four distinct cats, sir, I pledge you my honour. Now
      you know that&rsquo;s infernal clever! Damme, you can&rsquo;t help liking a man, when
      you see these traits about him. He&rsquo;s only one fault&mdash;that little
      failing I mentioned to you, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Smangle shook his head in a confidential and sympathising manner at
      this juncture, Mr. Pickwick felt that he was expected to say something, so
      he said, &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; and looked restlessly at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; echoed Mr. Smangle, with a long-drawn sigh. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s delightful
      company, that man is, sir. I don&rsquo;t know better company anywhere; but he
      has that one drawback. If the ghost of his grandfather, Sir, was to rise
      before him this minute, he&rsquo;d ask him for the loan of his acceptance on an
      eightpenny stamp.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear me!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; added Mr. Smangle; &lsquo;and if he&rsquo;d the power of raising him again, he
      would, in two months and three days from this time, to renew the bill!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those are very remarkable traits,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid
      that while we are talking here, my friends may be in a state of great
      perplexity at not finding me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll show &lsquo;em the way,&rsquo; said Smangle, making for the door. &lsquo;Good-day. I
      won&rsquo;t disturb you while they&rsquo;re here, you know. By the bye&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Smangle pronounced the last three words, he stopped suddenly, reclosed
      the door which he had opened, and, walking softly back to Mr. Pickwick,
      stepped close up to him on tiptoe, and said, in a very soft whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t make it convenient to lend me half-a-crown till the latter
      end of next week, could you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick could scarcely forbear smiling, but managing to preserve his
      gravity, he drew forth the coin, and placed it in Mr. Smangle&rsquo;s palm; upon
      which, that gentleman, with many nods and winks, implying profound
      mystery, disappeared in quest of the three strangers, with whom he
      presently returned; and having coughed thrice, and nodded as many times,
      as an assurance to Mr. Pickwick that he would not forget to pay, he shook
      hands all round, in an engaging manner, and at length took himself off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear friends,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, shaking hands alternately with Mr.
      Tupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass, who were the three visitors in
      question, &lsquo;I am delighted to see you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The triumvirate were much affected. Mr. Tupman shook his head deploringly,
      Mr. Snodgrass drew forth his handkerchief, with undisguised emotion; and
      Mr. Winkle retired to the window, and sniffed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mornin&rsquo;, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n,&rsquo; said Sam, entering at the moment with the shoes and
      gaiters. &lsquo;Avay vith melincholly, as the little boy said ven his
      schoolmissus died. Velcome to the college, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This foolish fellow,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, tapping Sam on the head as he
      knelt down to button up his master&rsquo;s gaiters&mdash;&lsquo;this foolish fellow
      has got himself arrested, in order to be near me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; exclaimed the three friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a&mdash;stand steady, sir, if you please&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      a prisoner, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n. Con-fined, as the lady said.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A prisoner!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Winkle, with unaccountable vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo, sir!&rsquo; responded Sam, looking up. &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s the matter, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had hoped, Sam, that&mdash;Nothing, nothing,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle
      precipitately.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something so very abrupt and unsettled in Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s manner,
      that Mr. Pickwick involuntarily looked at his two friends for an
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, answering this mute appeal aloud. &lsquo;He
      has been much excited for two days past, and his whole demeanour very
      unlike what it usually is. We feared there must be something the matter,
      but he resolutely denies it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, colouring beneath Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s gaze; &lsquo;there
      is really nothing. I assure you there is nothing, my dear sir. It will be
      necessary for me to leave town, for a short time, on private business, and
      I had hoped to have prevailed upon you to allow Sam to accompany me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick looked more astonished than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; faltered Mr. Winkle, &lsquo;that Sam would have had no objection to
      do so; but, of course, his being a prisoner here, renders it impossible.
      So I must go alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Winkle said these words, Mr. Pickwick felt, with some astonishment,
      that Sam&rsquo;s fingers were trembling at the gaiters, as if he were rather
      surprised or startled. Sam looked up at Mr. Winkle, too, when he had
      finished speaking; and though the glance they exchanged was instantaneous,
      they seemed to understand each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know anything of this, Sam?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, beginning to button with
      extraordinary assiduity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you sure, Sam?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wy, sir,&rsquo; responded Mr. Weller; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure so far, that I&rsquo;ve never heerd
      anythin&rsquo; on the subject afore this moment. If I makes any guess about it,&rsquo; 
      added Sam, looking at Mr. Winkle, &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any right to say what it
      is, &lsquo;fear it should be a wrong &lsquo;un.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no right to make any further inquiry into the private affairs of a
      friend, however intimate a friend,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, after a short
      silence; &lsquo;at present let me merely say, that I do not understand this at
      all. There. We have had quite enough of the subject.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus expressing himself, Mr. Pickwick led the conversation to different
      topics, and Mr. Winkle gradually appeared more at ease, though still very
      far from being completely so. They had all so much to converse about, that
      the morning very quickly passed away; and when, at three o&rsquo;clock, Mr.
      Weller produced upon the little dining-table, a roast leg of mutton and an
      enormous meat-pie, with sundry dishes of vegetables, and pots of porter,
      which stood upon the chairs or the sofa bedstead, or where they could,
      everybody felt disposed to do justice to the meal, notwithstanding that
      the meat had been purchased, and dressed, and the pie made, and baked, at
      the prison cookery hard by.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these succeeded a bottle or two of very good wine, for which a
      messenger was despatched by Mr. Pickwick to the Horn Coffee-house, in
      Doctors&rsquo; Commons. The bottle or two, indeed, might be more properly
      described as a bottle or six, for by the time it was drunk, and tea over,
      the bell began to ring for strangers to withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, if Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s behaviour had been unaccountable in the morning, it
      became perfectly unearthly and solemn when, under the influence of his
      feelings, and his share of the bottle or six, he prepared to take leave of
      his friend. He lingered behind, until Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass had
      disappeared, and then fervently clenched Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s hand, with an
      expression of face in which deep and mighty resolve was fearfully blended
      with the very concentrated essence of gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night, my dear Sir!&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle between his set teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless you, my dear fellow!&rsquo; replied the warm-hearted Mr. Pickwick, as he
      returned the pressure of his young friend&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now then!&rsquo; cried Mr. Tupman from the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, directly,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle. &lsquo;Good-night!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another good-night, and another, and half a dozen more after
      that, and still Mr. Winkle had fast hold of his friend&rsquo;s hand, and was
      looking into his face with the same strange expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is anything the matter?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick at last, when his arm was
      quite sore with shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well then, good-night,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, attempting to disengage his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friend, my benefactor, my honoured companion,&rsquo; murmured Mr. Winkle,
      catching at his wrist. &lsquo;Do not judge me harshly; do not, when you hear
      that, driven to extremity by hopeless obstacles, I&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now then,&rsquo; said Mr. Tupman, reappearing at the door. &lsquo;Are you coming, or
      are we to be locked in?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, I am ready,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle. And with a violent effort he
      tore himself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Pickwick was gazing down the passage after them in silent
      astonishment, Sam Weller appeared at the stair-head, and whispered for one
      moment in Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, certainly, depend upon me,&rsquo; said that gentleman aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, sir. You won&rsquo;t forget, sir?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wish you luck, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam, touching his hat. &lsquo;I should very much
      liked to ha&rsquo; joined you, Sir; but the gov&rsquo;nor, o&rsquo; course, is paramount.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very much to your credit that you remain here,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.
      With these words they disappeared down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very extraordinary,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, going back into his room, and
      seating himself at the table in a musing attitude. &lsquo;What can that young
      man be going to do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had sat ruminating about the matter for some time, when the voice of
      Roker, the turnkey, demanded whether he might come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By all means,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you a softer pillow, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Roker, &lsquo;instead of the
      temporary one you had last night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Will you take a glass of wine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re wery good, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Roker, accepting the proffered glass.
      &lsquo;Yours, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say that your landlord&rsquo;s wery bad to-night, Sir,&rsquo; said
      Roker, setting down the glass, and inspecting the lining of his hat
      preparatory to putting it on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! The Chancery prisoner!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t be a Chancery prisoner wery long, Sir,&rsquo; replied Roker, turning
      his hat round, so as to get the maker&rsquo;s name right side upwards, as he
      looked into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You make my blood run cold,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s been consumptive for a long time past,&rsquo; said Mr. Roker, &lsquo;and he&rsquo;s
      taken wery bad in the breath to-night. The doctor said, six months ago,
      that nothing but change of air could save him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Great Heaven!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;has this man been slowly murdered
      by the law for six months?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rsquo; replied Roker, weighing the hat by the brim in
      both hands. &lsquo;I suppose he&rsquo;d have been took the same, wherever he was. He
      went into the infirmary, this morning; the doctor says his strength is to
      be kept up as much as possible; and the warden&rsquo;s sent him wine and broth
      and that, from his own house. It&rsquo;s not the warden&rsquo;s fault, you know, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, however,&rsquo; said Roker, shaking his head, &lsquo;that it&rsquo;s all up
      with him. I offered Neddy two six-penn&rsquo;orths to one upon it just now, but
      he wouldn&rsquo;t take it, and quite right. Thank&rsquo;ee, Sir. Good-night, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick earnestly. &lsquo;Where is this infirmary?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just over where you slept, sir,&rsquo; replied Roker. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll show you, if you
      like to come.&rsquo; Mr. Pickwick snatched up his hat without speaking, and
      followed at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The turnkey led the way in silence; and gently raising the latch of the
      room door, motioned Mr. Pickwick to enter. It was a large, bare, desolate
      room, with a number of stump bedsteads made of iron, on one of which lay
      stretched the shadow of a man&mdash;wan, pale, and ghastly. His breathing
      was hard and thick, and he moaned painfully as it came and went. At the
      bedside sat a short old man in a cobbler&rsquo;s apron, who, by the aid of a
      pair of horn spectacles, was reading from the Bible aloud. It was the
      fortunate legatee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sick man laid his hand upon his attendant&rsquo;s arm, and motioned him to
      stop. He closed the book, and laid it on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Open the window,&rsquo; said the sick man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so. The noise of carriages and carts, the rattle of wheels, the
      cries of men and boys, all the busy sounds of a mighty multitude instinct
      with life and occupation, blended into one deep murmur, floated into the
      room. Above the hoarse loud hum, arose, from time to time, a boisterous
      laugh; or a scrap of some jingling song, shouted forth, by one of the
      giddy crowd, would strike upon the ear, for an instant, and then be lost
      amidst the roar of voices and the tramp of footsteps; the breaking of the
      billows of the restless sea of life, that rolled heavily on, without.
      These are melancholy sounds to a quiet listener at any time; but how
      melancholy to the watcher by the bed of death!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no air here,&rsquo; said the man faintly. &lsquo;The place pollutes it. It
      was fresh round about, when I walked there, years ago; but it grows hot
      and heavy in passing these walls. I cannot breathe it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have breathed it together, for a long time,&rsquo; said the old man. &lsquo;Come,
      come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence, during which the two spectators approached the
      bed. The sick man drew a hand of his old fellow-prisoner towards him, and
      pressing it affectionately between both his own, retained it in his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope,&rsquo; he gasped after a while, so faintly that they bent their ears
      close over the bed to catch the half-formed sounds his pale lips gave vent
      to&mdash;&lsquo;I hope my merciful Judge will bear in mind my heavy punishment
      on earth. Twenty years, my friend, twenty years in this hideous grave! My
      heart broke when my child died, and I could not even kiss him in his
      little coffin. My loneliness since then, in all this noise and riot, has
      been very dreadful. May God forgive me! He has seen my solitary, lingering
      death.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He folded his hands, and murmuring something more they could not hear,
      fell into a sleep&mdash;only a sleep at first, for they saw him smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      They whispered together for a little time, and the turnkey, stooping over
      the pillow, drew hastily back. &lsquo;He has got his discharge, by G&mdash;!&rsquo; 
      said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had. But he had grown so like death in life, that they knew not when he
      died.

      CHAPTER XLIV. DESCRIPTIVE OF AN AFFECTING INTERVIEW BETWEEN MR. SAMUEL
      WELLER AND A FAMILY PARTY. MR. PICKWICK MAKES A TOUR OF THE DIMINUTIVE
      WORLD HE INHABITS, AND RESOLVES TO MIX WITH IT, IN FUTURE, AS LITTLE AS
      POSSIBLE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> few mornings
      after his incarceration, Mr. Samuel Weller, having arranged his master&rsquo;s
      room with all possible care, and seen him comfortably seated over his
      books and papers, withdrew to employ himself for an hour or two to come,
      as he best could. It was a fine morning, and it occurred to Sam that a
      pint of porter in the open air would lighten his next quarter of an hour
      or so, as well as any little amusement in which he could indulge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having arrived at this conclusion, he betook himself to the tap. Having
      purchased the beer, and obtained, moreover, the
      day-but-one-before-yesterday&rsquo;s paper, he repaired to the skittle-ground,
      and seating himself on a bench, proceeded to enjoy himself in a very
      sedate and methodical manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, he took a refreshing draught of the beer, and then he looked
      up at a window, and bestowed a platonic wink on a young lady who was
      peeling potatoes thereat. Then he opened the paper, and folded it so as to
      get the police reports outwards; and this being a vexatious and difficult
      thing to do, when there is any wind stirring, he took another draught of
      the beer when he had accomplished it. Then, he read two lines of the
      paper, and stopped short to look at a couple of men who were finishing a
      game at rackets, which, being concluded, he cried out &lsquo;wery good,&rsquo; in an
      approving manner, and looked round upon the spectators, to ascertain
      whether their sentiments coincided with his own. This involved the
      necessity of looking up at the windows also; and as the young lady was
      still there, it was an act of common politeness to wink again, and to
      drink to her good health in dumb show, in another draught of the beer,
      which Sam did; and having frowned hideously upon a small boy who had noted
      this latter proceeding with open eyes, he threw one leg over the other,
      and, holding the newspaper in both hands, began to read in real earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly composed himself into the needful state of abstraction, when
      he thought he heard his own name proclaimed in some distant passage. Nor
      was he mistaken, for it quickly passed from mouth to mouth, and in a few
      seconds the air teemed with shouts of &lsquo;Weller!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here!&rsquo; roared Sam, in a stentorian voice. &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s the matter? Who wants
      him? Has an express come to say that his country house is afire?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Somebody wants you in the hall,&rsquo; said a man who was standing by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just mind that &lsquo;ere paper and the pot, old feller, will you?&rsquo; said Sam.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a-comin&rsquo;. Blessed, if they was a-callin&rsquo; me to the bar, they couldn&rsquo;t
      make more noise about it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Accompanying these words with a gentle rap on the head of the young
      gentleman before noticed, who, unconscious of his close vicinity to the
      person in request, was screaming &lsquo;Weller!&rsquo; with all his might, Sam
      hastened across the ground, and ran up the steps into the hall. Here, the
      first object that met his eyes was his beloved father sitting on a bottom
      stair, with his hat in his hand, shouting out &lsquo;Weller!&rsquo; in his very
      loudest tone, at half-minute intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot are you a-roarin&rsquo; at?&rsquo; said Sam impetuously, when the old gentleman
      had discharged himself of another shout; &lsquo;making yourself so precious hot
      that you looks like a aggrawated glass-blower. Wot&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; replied the old gentleman, &lsquo;I began to be afeerd that you&rsquo;d gone
      for a walk round the Regency Park, Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;none o&rsquo; them taunts agin the wictim o&rsquo; avarice, and
      come off that &lsquo;ere step. Wot are you a-settin&rsquo; down there for? I don&rsquo;t
      live there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got such a game for you, Sammy,&rsquo; said the elder Mr. Weller, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop a minit,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re all vite behind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right, Sammy, rub it off,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, as his son dusted him.
      &lsquo;It might look personal here, if a man walked about with vitevash on his
      clothes, eh, Sammy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Weller exhibited in this place unequivocal symptoms of an
      approaching fit of chuckling, Sam interposed to stop it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep quiet, do,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;there never vos such a old picter-card born.
      Wot are you bustin&rsquo; vith, now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, wiping his forehead, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afeerd that vun o&rsquo; 
      these days I shall laugh myself into a appleplexy, my boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell, then, wot do you do it for?&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;Now, then, wot have you got
      to say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who do you think&rsquo;s come here with me, Samivel?&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, drawing
      back a pace or two, pursing up his mouth, and extending his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pell?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller shook his head, and his red cheeks expanded with the laughter
      that was endeavouring to find a vent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mottled-faced man, p&rsquo;raps?&rsquo; asked Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mr. Weller shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who then?&rsquo; asked Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your mother-in-law,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller; and it was lucky he did say it, or
      his cheeks must inevitably have cracked, from their most unnatural
      distension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your mother-in-law, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, &lsquo;and the red-nosed man, my
      boy; and the red-nosed man. Ho! ho! ho!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, Mr. Weller launched into convulsions of laughter, while Sam
      regarded him with a broad grin gradually over-spreading his whole
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve come to have a little serious talk with you, Samivel,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Weller, wiping his eyes. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let out nothin&rsquo; about the unnat&rsquo;ral
      creditor, Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot, don&rsquo;t they know who it is?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit on it,&rsquo; replied his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vere are they?&rsquo; said Sam, reciprocating all the old gentleman&rsquo;s grins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the snuggery,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Catch the red-nosed man a-goin&rsquo; 
      anyvere but vere the liquors is; not he, Samivel, not he. Ve&rsquo;d a wery
      pleasant ride along the road from the Markis this mornin&rsquo;, Sammy,&rsquo; said
      Mr. Weller, when he felt himself equal to the task of speaking in an
      articulate manner. &lsquo;I drove the old piebald in that &lsquo;ere little chay-cart
      as belonged to your mother-in-law&rsquo;s first wenter, into vich a harm-cheer
      wos lifted for the shepherd; and I&rsquo;m blessed,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, with a
      look of deep scorn&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m blessed if they didn&rsquo;t bring a portable
      flight o&rsquo; steps out into the road a-front o&rsquo; our door for him, to get up
      by.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do mean that, Sammy,&rsquo; replied his father, &lsquo;and I vish you could ha&rsquo; 
      seen how tight he held on by the sides wen he did get up, as if he wos
      afeerd o&rsquo; being precipitayted down full six foot, and dashed into a
      million hatoms. He tumbled in at last, however, and avay ve vent; and I
      rayther think&mdash;I say I rayther think, Samivel&mdash;that he found
      his-self a little jolted ven ve turned the corners.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot, I s&rsquo;pose you happened to drive up agin a post or two?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afeerd,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, in a rapture of winks&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afeerd
      I took vun or two on &lsquo;em, Sammy; he wos a-flyin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; the arm-cheer all
      the way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the old gentleman shook his head from side to side, and was seized
      with a hoarse internal rumbling, accompanied with a violent swelling of
      the countenance, and a sudden increase in the breadth of all his features;
      symptoms which alarmed his son not a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, Sammy, don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rsquo; said the old gentleman,
      when by dint of much struggling, and various convulsive stamps upon the
      ground, he had recovered his voice. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only a kind o&rsquo; quiet laugh as
      I&rsquo;m a-tryin&rsquo; to come, Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s wot it is,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;you&rsquo;d better not try to come it
      agin. You&rsquo;ll find it rayther a dangerous inwention.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you like it, Sammy?&rsquo; inquired the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, with the tears still running down his cheeks, &lsquo;it
      &lsquo;ud ha&rsquo; been a wery great accommodation to me if I could ha&rsquo; done it, and
      &lsquo;ud ha&rsquo; saved a good many vords atween your mother-in-law and me,
      sometimes; but I&rsquo;m afeerd you&rsquo;re right, Sammy, it&rsquo;s too much in the
      appleplexy line&mdash;a deal too much, Samivel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This conversation brought them to the door of the snuggery, into which Sam&mdash;pausing
      for an instant to look over his shoulder, and cast a sly leer at his
      respected progenitor, who was still giggling behind&mdash;at once led the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother-in-law,&rsquo; said Sam, politely saluting the lady, &lsquo;wery much obliged
      to you for this here wisit.&mdash;Shepherd, how air you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Samuel!&rsquo; said Mrs. Weller. &lsquo;This is dreadful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit on it, mum,&rsquo; replied Sam.&mdash;&lsquo;Is it, shepherd?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stiggins raised his hands, and turned up his eyes, until the whites&mdash;or
      rather the yellows&mdash;were alone visible; but made no reply in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this here gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n troubled with any painful complaint?&rsquo; said Sam,
      looking to his mother-in-law for explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The good man is grieved to see you here, Samuel,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;I was afeerd, from his manner, that he
      might ha&rsquo; forgotten to take pepper vith that &lsquo;ere last cowcumber he eat.
      Set down, Sir, ve make no extra charge for settin&rsquo; down, as the king
      remarked wen he blowed up his ministers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Young man,&rsquo; said Mr. Stiggins ostentatiously, &lsquo;I fear you are not
      softened by imprisonment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beg your pardon, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam; &lsquo;wot wos you graciously pleased to
      hobserve?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I apprehend, young man, that your nature is no softer for this
      chastening,&rsquo; said Mr. Stiggins, in a loud voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re wery kind to say so. I hope my natur is <i>NOT
      </i> a soft vun, Sir. Wery much obliged to you for your good opinion,
      Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point of the conversation, a sound, indecorously approaching to a
      laugh, was heard to proceed from the chair in which the elder Mr. Weller
      was seated; upon which Mrs. Weller, on a hasty consideration of all the
      circumstances of the case, considered it her bounden duty to become
      gradually hysterical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Weller,&rsquo; said Mrs. W. (the old gentleman was seated in a corner);
      &lsquo;Weller! Come forth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery much obleeged to you, my dear,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m quite
      comfortable vere I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, Mrs. Weller burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s gone wrong, mum?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Samuel!&rsquo; replied Mrs. Weller, &lsquo;your father makes me wretched. Will
      nothing do him good?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you hear this here?&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;Lady vants to know vether nothin&rsquo; &lsquo;ull
      do you good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery much indebted to Mrs. Weller for her po-lite inquiries, Sammy,&rsquo; 
      replied the old gentleman. &lsquo;I think a pipe vould benefit me a good deal.
      Could I be accommodated, Sammy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mrs. Weller let fall some more tears, and Mr. Stiggins groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo! Here&rsquo;s this unfortunate gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n took ill agin,&rsquo; said Sam,
      looking round. &lsquo;Vere do you feel it now, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the same place, young man,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Stiggins, &lsquo;in the same
      place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vere may that be, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Sam, with great outward simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the buzzim, young man,&rsquo; replied Mr. Stiggins, placing his umbrella on
      his waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this affecting reply, Mrs. Weller, being wholly unable to suppress her
      feelings, sobbed aloud, and stated her conviction that the red-nosed man
      was a saint; whereupon Mr. Weller, senior, ventured to suggest, in an
      undertone, that he must be the representative of the united parishes of
      St. Simon Without and St. Walker Within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afeered, mum,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;that this here gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, with the twist in
      his countenance, feels rather thirsty, with the melancholy spectacle afore
      him. Is it the case, mum?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy lady looked at Mr. Stiggins for a reply; that gentleman, with
      many rollings of the eye, clenched his throat with his right hand, and
      mimicked the act of swallowing, to intimate that he was athirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid, Samuel, that his feelings have made him so indeed,&rsquo; said
      Mrs. Weller mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s your usual tap, sir?&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, my dear young friend,&rsquo; replied Mr. Stiggins, &lsquo;all taps is vanities!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too true, too true, indeed,&rsquo; said Mrs. Weller, murmuring a groan, and
      shaking her head assentingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;I des-say they may be, sir; but wich is your partickler
      wanity? Wich wanity do you like the flavour on best, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, my dear young friend,&rsquo; replied Mr. Stiggins, &lsquo;I despise them all.
      If,&rsquo; said Mr. Stiggins&mdash;&lsquo;if there is any one of them less odious than
      another, it is the liquor called rum. Warm, my dear young friend, with
      three lumps of sugar to the tumbler.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery sorry to say, sir,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;that they don&rsquo;t allow that particular
      wanity to be sold in this here establishment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the hardness of heart of these inveterate men!&rsquo; ejaculated Mr.
      Stiggins. &lsquo;Oh, the accursed cruelty of these inhuman persecutors!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Mr. Stiggins again cast up his eyes, and rapped his
      breast with his umbrella; and it is but justice to the reverend gentleman
      to say, that his indignation appeared very real and unfeigned indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Mrs. Weller and the red-nosed gentleman had commented on this
      inhuman usage in a very forcible manner, and had vented a variety of pious
      and holy execrations against its authors, the latter recommended a bottle
      of port wine, warmed with a little water, spice, and sugar, as being
      grateful to the stomach, and savouring less of vanity than many other
      compounds. It was accordingly ordered to be prepared, and pending its
      preparation the red-nosed man and Mrs. Weller looked at the elder W. and
      groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Sammy,&rsquo; said the gentleman, &lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll find your spirits rose
      by this here lively wisit. Wery cheerful and improvin&rsquo; conwersation, ain&rsquo;t
      it, Sammy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a reprobate,&rsquo; replied Sam; &lsquo;and I desire you won&rsquo;t address no more
      o&rsquo; them ungraceful remarks to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So far from being edified by this very proper reply, the elder Mr. Weller
      at once relapsed into a broad grin; and this inexorable conduct causing
      the lady and Mr. Stiggins to close their eyes, and rock themselves to and
      fro on their chairs, in a troubled manner, he furthermore indulged in
      several acts of pantomime, indicative of a desire to pummel and wring the
      nose of the aforesaid Stiggins, the performance of which, appeared to
      afford him great mental relief. The old gentleman very narrowly escaped
      detection in one instance; for Mr. Stiggins happening to give a start on
      the arrival of the negus, brought his head in smart contact with the
      clenched fist with which Mr. Weller had been describing imaginary
      fireworks in the air, within two inches of his ear, for some minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot are you a-reachin&rsquo; out, your hand for the tumbler in that &lsquo;ere sawage
      way for?&rsquo; said Sam, with great promptitude. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see you&rsquo;ve hit the
      gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t go to do it, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, in some degree abashed by
      the very unexpected occurrence of the incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Try an in&rsquo;ard application, sir,&rsquo; said Sam, as the red-nosed gentleman
      rubbed his head with a rueful visage. &lsquo;Wot do you think o&rsquo; that, for a go
      o&rsquo; wanity, warm, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stiggins made no verbal answer, but his manner was expressive. He
      tasted the contents of the glass which Sam had placed in his hand, put his
      umbrella on the floor, and tasted it again, passing his hand placidly
      across his stomach twice or thrice; he then drank the whole at a breath,
      and smacking his lips, held out the tumbler for more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Mrs. Weller behind-hand in doing justice to the composition. The
      good lady began by protesting that she couldn&rsquo;t touch a drop&mdash;then
      took a small drop&mdash;then a large drop&mdash;then a great many drops;
      and her feelings being of the nature of those substances which are
      powerfully affected by the application of strong waters, she dropped a
      tear with every drop of negus, and so got on, melting the feelings down,
      until at length she had arrived at a very pathetic and decent pitch of
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Mr. Weller observed these signs and tokens with many
      manifestations of disgust, and when, after a second jug of the same, Mr.
      Stiggins began to sigh in a dismal manner, he plainly evinced his
      disapprobation of the whole proceedings, by sundry incoherent ramblings of
      speech, among which frequent angry repetitions of the word &lsquo;gammon&rsquo; were
      alone distinguishable to the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you wot it is, Samivel, my boy,&rsquo; whispered the old gentleman
      into his son&rsquo;s ear, after a long and steadfast contemplation of his lady
      and Mr. Stiggins; &lsquo;I think there must be somethin&rsquo; wrong in your
      mother-in-law&rsquo;s inside, as vell as in that o&rsquo; the red-nosed man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot do you mean?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean this here, Sammy,&rsquo; replied the old gentleman, &lsquo;that wot they
      drink, don&rsquo;t seem no nourishment to &lsquo;em; it all turns to warm water, and
      comes a-pourin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; their eyes. &lsquo;Pend upon it, Sammy, it&rsquo;s a
      constitootional infirmity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller delivered this scientific opinion with many confirmatory frowns
      and nods; which, Mrs. Weller remarking, and concluding that they bore some
      disparaging reference either to herself or to Mr. Stiggins, or to both,
      was on the point of becoming infinitely worse, when Mr. Stiggins, getting
      on his legs as well as he could, proceeded to deliver an edifying
      discourse for the benefit of the company, but more especially of Mr.
      Samuel, whom he adjured in moving terms to be upon his guard in that sink
      of iniquity into which he was cast; to abstain from all hypocrisy and
      pride of heart; and to take in all things exact pattern and copy by him
      (Stiggins), in which case he might calculate on arriving, sooner or later
      at the comfortable conclusion, that, like him, he was a most estimable and
      blameless character, and that all his acquaintances and friends were
      hopelessly abandoned and profligate wretches. Which consideration, he
      said, could not but afford him the liveliest satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He furthermore conjured him to avoid, above all things, the vice of
      intoxication, which he likened unto the filthy habits of swine, and to
      those poisonous and baleful drugs which being chewed in the mouth, are
      said to filch away the memory. At this point of his discourse, the
      reverend and red-nosed gentleman became singularly incoherent, and
      staggering to and fro in the excitement of his eloquence, was fain to
      catch at the back of a chair to preserve his perpendicular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stiggins did not desire his hearers to be upon their guard against
      those false prophets and wretched mockers of religion, who, without sense
      to expound its first doctrines, or hearts to feel its first principles,
      are more dangerous members of society than the common criminal; imposing,
      as they necessarily do, upon the weakest and worst informed, casting scorn
      and contempt on what should be held most sacred, and bringing into partial
      disrepute large bodies of virtuous and well-conducted persons of many
      excellent sects and persuasions. But as he leaned over the back of the
      chair for a considerable time, and closing one eye, winked a good deal
      with the other, it is presumed that he thought all this, but kept it to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the delivery of the oration, Mrs. Weller sobbed and wept at the end
      of the paragraphs; while Sam, sitting cross-legged on a chair and resting
      his arms on the top rail, regarded the speaker with great suavity and
      blandness of demeanour; occasionally bestowing a look of recognition on
      the old gentleman, who was delighted at the beginning, and went to sleep
      about half-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brayvo; wery pretty!&rsquo; said Sam, when the red-nosed man having finished,
      pulled his worn gloves on, thereby thrusting his fingers through the
      broken tops till the knuckles were disclosed to view. &lsquo;Wery pretty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope it may do you good, Samuel,&rsquo; said Mrs. Weller solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it vill, mum,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I could hope that it would do your father good,&rsquo; said Mrs. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, my dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, senior. &lsquo;How do you find yourself
      arter it, my love?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Scoffer!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Benighted man!&rsquo; said the Reverend Mr. Stiggins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I don&rsquo;t get no better light than that &lsquo;ere moonshine o&rsquo; yourn, my
      worthy creetur,&rsquo; said the elder Mr. Weller, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s wery likely as I shall
      continey to be a night coach till I&rsquo;m took off the road altogether. Now,
      Mrs. We, if the piebald stands at livery much longer, he&rsquo;ll stand at
      nothin&rsquo; as we go back, and p&rsquo;raps that &lsquo;ere harm-cheer &lsquo;ull be tipped over
      into some hedge or another, with the shepherd in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this supposition, the Reverend Mr. Stiggins, in evident consternation,
      gathered up his hat and umbrella, and proposed an immediate departure, to
      which Mrs. Weller assented. Sam walked with them to the lodge gate, and
      took a dutiful leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A-do, Samivel,&rsquo; said the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s a-do?&rsquo; inquired Sammy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, good-bye, then,&rsquo; said the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s wot you&rsquo;re aimin&rsquo; at, is it?&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;Good-bye!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sammy,&rsquo; whispered Mr. Weller, looking cautiously round; &lsquo;my duty to your
      gov&rsquo;nor, and tell him if he thinks better o&rsquo; this here bis&rsquo;ness, to
      com-moonicate vith me. Me and a cab&rsquo;net-maker has dewised a plan for
      gettin&rsquo; him out. A pianner, Samivel&mdash;a pianner!&rsquo; said Mr. Weller,
      striking his son on the chest with the back of his hand, and falling back
      a step or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot do you mean?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pianner-forty, Samivel,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Weller, in a still more
      mysterious manner, &lsquo;as he can have on hire; vun as von&rsquo;t play, Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And wot &lsquo;ud be the good o&rsquo; that?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let him send to my friend, the cabinet-maker, to fetch it back, Sammy,&rsquo; 
      replied Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Are you avake, now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; rejoined Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There ain&rsquo;t no vurks in it,&rsquo; whispered his father. &lsquo;It &lsquo;ull hold him
      easy, vith his hat and shoes on, and breathe through the legs, vich his
      holler. Have a passage ready taken for &lsquo;Merriker. The &lsquo;Merrikin gov&rsquo;ment
      will never give him up, ven vunce they find as he&rsquo;s got money to spend,
      Sammy. Let the gov&rsquo;nor stop there, till Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s dead, or Mr. Dodson
      and Fogg&rsquo;s hung (wich last ewent I think is the most likely to happen
      first, Sammy), and then let him come back and write a book about the
      &lsquo;Merrikins as&rsquo;ll pay all his expenses and more, if he blows &lsquo;em up
      enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller delivered this hurried abstract of his plot with great
      vehemence of whisper; and then, as if fearful of weakening the effect of
      the tremendous communication by any further dialogue, he gave the
      coachman&rsquo;s salute, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam had scarcely recovered his usual composure of countenance, which had
      been greatly disturbed by the secret communication of his respected
      relative, when Mr. Pickwick accosted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going for a walk round the prison, and I wish you to attend me. I
      see a prisoner we know coming this way, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wich, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller; &lsquo;the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n vith the head o&rsquo; hair, or
      the interestin&rsquo; captive in the stockin&rsquo;s?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Neither,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;He is an older friend of yours, Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O&rsquo; mine, Sir?&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You recollect the gentleman very well, I dare say, Sam,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Pickwick, &lsquo;or else you are more unmindful of your old acquaintances than I
      think you are. Hush! not a word, Sam; not a syllable. Here he is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Pickwick spoke, Jingle walked up. He looked less miserable than
      before, being clad in a half-worn suit of clothes, which, with Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s assistance, had been released from the pawnbroker&rsquo;s. He wore
      clean linen too, and had had his hair cut. He was very pale and thin,
      however; and as he crept slowly up, leaning on a stick, it was easy to see
      that he had suffered severely from illness and want, and was still very
      weak. He took off his hat as Mr. Pickwick saluted him, and seemed much
      humbled and abashed at the sight of Sam Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following close at his heels, came Mr. Job Trotter, in the catalogue of
      whose vices, want of faith and attachment to his companion could at all
      events find no place. He was still ragged and squalid, but his face was
      not quite so hollow as on his first meeting with Mr. Pickwick, a few days
      before. As he took off his hat to our benevolent old friend, he murmured
      some broken expressions of gratitude, and muttered something about having
      been saved from starving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, impatiently interrupting him, &lsquo;you can
      follow with Sam. I want to speak to you, Mr. Jingle. Can you walk without
      his arm?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, sir&mdash;all ready&mdash;not too fast&mdash;legs shaky&mdash;head
      queer&mdash;round and round&mdash;earthquaky sort of feeling&mdash;very.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, give me your arm,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; replied Jingle; &lsquo;won&rsquo;t indeed&mdash;rather not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;lean upon me, I desire, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that he was confused and agitated, and uncertain what to do, Mr.
      Pickwick cut the matter short by drawing the invalided stroller&rsquo;s arm
      through his, and leading him away, without saying another word about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the whole of this time the countenance of Mr. Samuel Weller had
      exhibited an expression of the most overwhelming and absorbing
      astonishment that the imagination can portray. After looking from Job to
      Jingle, and from Jingle to Job in profound silence, he softly ejaculated
      the words, &lsquo;Well, I <i>am</i> damn&rsquo;d!&rsquo; which he repeated at least a score
      of times; after which exertion, he appeared wholly bereft of speech, and
      again cast his eyes, first upon the one and then upon the other, in mute
      perplexity and bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Sam!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a-comin&rsquo;, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, mechanically following his
      master; and still he lifted not his eyes from Mr. Job Trotter, who walked
      at his side in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Job kept his eyes fixed on the ground for some time. Sam, with his glued
      to Job&rsquo;s countenance, ran up against the people who were walking about,
      and fell over little children, and stumbled against steps and railings,
      without appearing at all sensible of it, until Job, looking stealthily up,
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you do, Mr. Weller?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It <i>is</i> him!&rsquo; exclaimed Sam; and having established Job&rsquo;s identity
      beyond all doubt, he smote his leg, and vented his feelings in a long,
      shrill whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Things has altered with me, sir,&rsquo; said Job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think they had,&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Weller, surveying his companion&rsquo;s
      rags with undisguised wonder. &lsquo;This is rayther a change for the worse, Mr.
      Trotter, as the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n said, wen he got two doubtful shillin&rsquo;s and
      sixpenn&rsquo;orth o&rsquo; pocket-pieces for a good half-crown.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is indeed,&rsquo; replied Job, shaking his head. &lsquo;There is no deception now,
      Mr. Weller. Tears,&rsquo; said Job, with a look of momentary slyness&mdash;&lsquo;tears
      are not the only proofs of distress, nor the best ones.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, they ain&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied Sam expressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They may be put on, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said Job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know they may,&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;some people, indeed, has &lsquo;em always ready
      laid on, and can pull out the plug wenever they likes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Job; &lsquo;but these sort of things are not so easily
      counterfeited, Mr. Weller, and it is a more painful process to get them
      up.&rsquo; As he spoke, he pointed to his sallow, sunken cheeks, and, drawing up
      his coat sleeve, disclosed an arm which looked as if the bone could be
      broken at a touch, so sharp and brittle did it appear, beneath its thin
      covering of flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot have you been a-doin&rsquo; to yourself?&rsquo; said Sam, recoiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; replied Job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothin&rsquo;!&rsquo; echoed Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been doin&rsquo; nothing for many weeks past,&rsquo; said Job; and eating and
      drinking almost as little.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam took one comprehensive glance at Mr. Trotter&rsquo;s thin face and wretched
      apparel; and then, seizing him by the arm, commenced dragging him away
      with great violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are you going, Mr. Weller?&rsquo; said Job, vainly struggling in the
      powerful grasp of his old enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;come on!&rsquo; He deigned no further explanation till
      they reached the tap, and then called for a pot of porter, which was
      speedily produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;drink that up, ev&rsquo;ry drop on it, and then turn the pot
      upside down, to let me see as you&rsquo;ve took the medicine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, my dear Mr. Weller,&rsquo; remonstrated Job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Down vith it!&rsquo; said Sam peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus admonished, Mr. Trotter raised the pot to his lips, and, by gentle
      and almost imperceptible degrees, tilted it into the air. He paused once,
      and only once, to draw a long breath, but without raising his face from
      the vessel, which, in a few moments thereafter, he held out at arm&rsquo;s
      length, bottom upward. Nothing fell upon the ground but a few particles of
      froth, which slowly detached themselves from the rim, and trickled lazily
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well done!&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;How do you find yourself arter it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better, Sir. I think I am better,&rsquo; responded Job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O&rsquo; course you air,&rsquo; said Sam argumentatively. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s like puttin&rsquo; gas in a
      balloon. I can see with the naked eye that you gets stouter under the
      operation. Wot do you say to another o&rsquo; the same dimensions?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would rather not, I am much obliged to you, Sir,&rsquo; replied Job&mdash;&lsquo;much
      rather not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell, then, wot do you say to some wittles?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thanks to your worthy governor, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Trotter, &lsquo;we have half a
      leg of mutton, baked, at a quarter before three, with the potatoes under
      it to save boiling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot! Has <i>he</i> been a-purwidin&rsquo; for you?&rsquo; asked Sam emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has, Sir,&rsquo; replied Job. &lsquo;More than that, Mr. Weller; my master being
      very ill, he got us a room&mdash;we were in a kennel before&mdash;and paid
      for it, Sir; and come to look at us, at night, when nobody should know.
      Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said Job, with real tears in his eyes, for once, &lsquo;I could
      serve that gentleman till I fell down dead at his feet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say!&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll trouble you, my friend! None o&rsquo; that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Job Trotter looked amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None o&rsquo; that, I say, young feller,&rsquo; repeated Sam firmly. &lsquo;No man serves
      him but me. And now we&rsquo;re upon it, I&rsquo;ll let you into another secret
      besides that,&rsquo; said Sam, as he paid for the beer. &lsquo;I never heerd, mind
      you, or read of in story-books, nor see in picters, any angel in tights
      and gaiters&mdash;not even in spectacles, as I remember, though that may
      ha&rsquo; been done for anythin&rsquo; I know to the contrairey&mdash;but mark my
      vords, Job Trotter, he&rsquo;s a reg&rsquo;lar thoroughbred angel for all that; and
      let me see the man as wenturs to tell me he knows a better vun.&rsquo; With this
      defiance, Mr. Weller buttoned up his change in a side pocket, and, with
      many confirmatory nods and gestures by the way, proceeded in search of the
      subject of discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Mr. Pickwick, in company with Jingle, talking very earnestly,
      and not bestowing a look on the groups who were congregated on the
      racket-ground; they were very motley groups too, and worth the looking at,
      if it were only in idle curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as Sam and his companion drew nigh, &lsquo;you will
      see how your health becomes, and think about it meanwhile. Make the
      statement out for me when you feel yourself equal to the task, and I will
      discuss the subject with you when I have considered it. Now, go to your
      room. You are tired, and not strong enough to be out long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Alfred Jingle, without one spark of his old animation&mdash;with
      nothing even of the dismal gaiety which he had assumed when Mr. Pickwick
      first stumbled on him in his misery&mdash;bowed low without speaking, and,
      motioning to Job not to follow him just yet, crept slowly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Curious scene this, is it not, Sam?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking
      good-humouredly round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery much so, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;Wonders &lsquo;ull never cease,&rsquo; added Sam,
      speaking to himself. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m wery much mistaken if that &lsquo;ere Jingle worn&rsquo;t
      a-doin somethin&rsquo; in the water-cart way!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The area formed by the wall in that part of the Fleet in which Mr.
      Pickwick stood was just wide enough to make a good racket-court; one side
      being formed, of course, by the wall itself, and the other by that portion
      of the prison which looked (or rather would have looked, but for the wall)
      towards St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral. Sauntering or sitting about, in every
      possible attitude of listless idleness, were a great number of debtors,
      the major part of whom were waiting in prison until their day of &lsquo;going
      up&rsquo; before the Insolvent Court should arrive; while others had been
      remanded for various terms, which they were idling away as they best
      could. Some were shabby, some were smart, many dirty, a few clean; but
      there they all lounged, and loitered, and slunk about with as little
      spirit or purpose as the beasts in a menagerie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lolling from the windows which commanded a view of this promenade were a
      number of persons, some in noisy conversation with their acquaintance
      below, others playing at ball with some adventurous throwers outside,
      others looking on at the racket-players, or watching the boys as they
      cried the game. Dirty, slipshod women passed and repassed, on their way to
      the cooking-house in one corner of the yard; children screamed, and
      fought, and played together, in another; the tumbling of the skittles, and
      the shouts of the players, mingled perpetually with these and a hundred
      other sounds; and all was noise and tumult&mdash;save in a little
      miserable shed a few yards off, where lay, all quiet and ghastly, the body
      of the Chancery prisoner who had died the night before, awaiting the
      mockery of an inquest. The body! It is the lawyer&rsquo;s term for the restless,
      whirling mass of cares and anxieties, affections, hopes, and griefs, that
      make up the living man. The law had his body; and there it lay, clothed in
      grave-clothes, an awful witness to its tender mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you like to see a whistling-shop, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Job Trotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; was Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s counter inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A vistlin&rsquo; shop, Sir,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is that, Sam?&mdash;A bird-fancier&rsquo;s?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless your heart, no, Sir,&rsquo; replied Job; &lsquo;a whistling-shop, Sir, is where
      they sell spirits.&rsquo; Mr. Job Trotter briefly explained here, that all
      persons, being prohibited under heavy penalties from conveying spirits
      into debtors&rsquo; prisons, and such commodities being highly prized by the
      ladies and gentlemen confined therein, it had occurred to some speculative
      turnkey to connive, for certain lucrative considerations, at two or three
      prisoners retailing the favourite article of gin, for their own profit and
      advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This plan, you see, Sir, has been gradually introduced into all the
      prisons for debt,&rsquo; said Mr. Trotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it has this wery great advantage,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;that the turnkeys takes
      wery good care to seize hold o&rsquo; ev&rsquo;rybody but them as pays &lsquo;em, that
      attempts the willainy, and wen it gets in the papers they&rsquo;re applauded for
      their wigilance; so it cuts two ways&mdash;frightens other people from the
      trade, and elewates their own characters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly so, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; observed Job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, but are these rooms never searched to ascertain whether any spirits
      are concealed in them?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cert&rsquo;nly they are, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam; &lsquo;but the turnkeys knows beforehand,
      and gives the word to the wistlers, and you may wistle for it wen you go
      to look.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, Job had tapped at a door, which was opened by a gentleman
      with an uncombed head, who bolted it after them when they had walked in,
      and grinned; upon which Job grinned, and Sam also; whereupon Mr. Pickwick,
      thinking it might be expected of him, kept on smiling to the end of the
      interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman with the uncombed head appeared quite satisfied with this
      mute announcement of their business, and, producing a flat stone bottle,
      which might hold about a couple of quarts, from beneath his bedstead,
      filled out three glasses of gin, which Job Trotter and Sam disposed of in
      a most workmanlike manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any more?&rsquo; said the whistling gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more,&rsquo; replied Job Trotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick paid, the door was unbolted, and out they came; the uncombed
      gentleman bestowing a friendly nod upon Mr. Roker, who happened to be
      passing at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this spot, Mr. Pickwick wandered along all the galleries, up and down
      all the staircases, and once again round the whole area of the yard. The
      great body of the prison population appeared to be Mivins, and Smangle,
      and the parson, and the butcher, and the leg, over and over, and over
      again. There were the same squalor, the same turmoil and noise, the same
      general characteristics, in every corner; in the best and the worst alike.
      The whole place seemed restless and troubled; and the people were crowding
      and flitting to and fro, like the shadows in an uneasy dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have seen enough,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as he threw himself into a chair
      in his little apartment. &lsquo;My head aches with these scenes, and my heart
      too. Henceforth I will be a prisoner in my own room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Pickwick steadfastly adhered to this determination. For three long
      months he remained shut up, all day; only stealing out at night to breathe
      the air, when the greater part of his fellow-prisoners were in bed or
      carousing in their rooms. His health was beginning to suffer from the
      closeness of the confinement, but neither the often-repeated entreaties of
      Perker and his friends, nor the still more frequently-repeated warnings
      and admonitions of Mr. Samuel Weller, could induce him to alter one jot of
      his inflexible resolution.

      CHAPTER XLVI. RECORDS A TOUCHING ACT OF DELICATE FEELING, NOT UNMIXED WITH
      PLEASANTRY, ACHIEVED AND PERFORMED BY Messrs. DODSON AND FOGG
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was within a
      week of the close of the month of July, that a hackney cabriolet, number
      unrecorded, was seen to proceed at a rapid pace up Goswell Street; three
      people were squeezed into it besides the driver, who sat in his own
      particular little dickey at the side; over the apron were hung two shawls,
      belonging to two small vixenish-looking ladies under the apron; between
      whom, compressed into a very small compass, was stowed away, a gentleman
      of heavy and subdued demeanour, who, whenever he ventured to make an
      observation, was snapped up short by one of the vixenish ladies
      before-mentioned. Lastly, the two vixenish ladies and the heavy gentleman
      were giving the driver contradictory directions, all tending to the one
      point, that he should stop at Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s door; which the heavy
      gentleman, in direct opposition to, and defiance of, the vixenish ladies,
      contended was a green door and not a yellow one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop at the house with a green door, driver,&rsquo; said the heavy gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! You perwerse creetur!&rsquo; exclaimed one of the vixenish ladies. &lsquo;Drive
      to the &lsquo;ouse with the yellow door, cabmin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this the cabman, who in a sudden effort to pull up at the house with
      the green door, had pulled the horse up so high that he nearly pulled him
      backward into the cabriolet, let the animal&rsquo;s fore-legs down to the ground
      again, and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now vere am I to pull up?&rsquo; inquired the driver. &lsquo;Settle it among
      yourselves. All I ask is, vere?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the contest was renewed with increased violence; and the horse being
      troubled with a fly on his nose, the cabman humanely employed his leisure
      in lashing him about on the head, on the counter-irritation principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most wotes carries the day!&rsquo; said one of the vixenish ladies at length.
      &lsquo;The &lsquo;ouse with the yellow door, cabman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But after the cabriolet had dashed up, in splendid style, to the house
      with the yellow door, &lsquo;making,&rsquo; as one of the vixenish ladies triumphantly
      said, &lsquo;acterrally more noise than if one had come in one&rsquo;s own carriage,&rsquo; 
      and after the driver had dismounted to assist the ladies in getting out,
      the small round head of Master Thomas Bardell was thrust out of the
      one-pair window of a house with a red door, a few numbers off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aggrawatin&rsquo; thing!&rsquo; said the vixenish lady last-mentioned, darting a
      withering glance at the heavy gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, it&rsquo;s not my fault,&rsquo; said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me, you creetur, don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; retorted the lady. &lsquo;The house with
      the red door, cabmin. Oh! If ever a woman was troubled with a ruffinly
      creetur, that takes a pride and a pleasure in disgracing his wife on every
      possible occasion afore strangers, I am that woman!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Raddle,&rsquo; said the other little
      woman, who was no other than Mrs. Cluppins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have I been a-doing of?&rsquo; asked Mr. Raddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me, don&rsquo;t, you brute, for fear I should be perwoked to
      forgit my sect and strike you!&rsquo; said Mrs. Raddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this dialogue was going on, the driver was most ignominiously
      leading the horse, by the bridle, up to the house with the red door, which
      Master Bardell had already opened. Here was a mean and low way of arriving
      at a friend&rsquo;s house! No dashing up, with all the fire and fury of the
      animal; no jumping down of the driver; no loud knocking at the door; no
      opening of the apron with a crash at the very last moment, for fear of the
      ladies sitting in a draught; and then the man handing the shawls out,
      afterwards, as if he were a private coachman! The whole edge of the thing
      had been taken off&mdash;it was flatter than walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Tommy,&rsquo; said Mrs. Cluppins, &lsquo;how&rsquo;s your poor dear mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s very well,&rsquo; replied Master Bardell. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s in the front
      parlour, all ready. I&rsquo;m ready too, I am.&rsquo; Here Master Bardell put his
      hands in his pockets, and jumped off and on the bottom step of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is anybody else a-goin&rsquo;, Tommy?&rsquo; said Mrs. Cluppins, arranging her
      pelerine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Sanders is going, she is,&rsquo; replied Tommy; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going too, I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drat the boy,&rsquo; said little Mrs. Cluppins. &lsquo;He thinks of nobody but
      himself. Here, Tommy, dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Master Bardell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who else is a-goin&rsquo;, lovey?&rsquo; said Mrs. Cluppins, in an insinuating
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Mrs. Rogers is a-goin&rsquo;,&rsquo; replied Master Bardell, opening his eyes
      very wide as he delivered the intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What? The lady as has taken the lodgings!&rsquo; ejaculated Mrs. Cluppins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Bardell put his hands deeper down into his pockets, and nodded
      exactly thirty-five times, to imply that it was the lady-lodger, and no
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless us!&rsquo; said Mrs. Cluppins. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s quite a party!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, if you knew what was in the cupboard, you&rsquo;d say so,&rsquo; replied Master
      Bardell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is there, Tommy?&rsquo; said Mrs. Cluppins coaxingly. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll tell <i>me</i>,
      Tommy, I know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied Master Bardell, shaking his head, and applying
      himself to the bottom step again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drat the child!&rsquo; muttered Mrs. Cluppins. &lsquo;What a prowokin&rsquo; little wretch
      it is! Come, Tommy, tell your dear Cluppy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother said I wasn&rsquo;t to,&rsquo; rejoined Master Bardell, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to have
      some, I am.&rsquo; Cheered by this prospect, the precocious boy applied himself
      to his infantile treadmill, with increased vigour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above examination of a child of tender years took place while Mr. and
      Mrs. Raddle and the cab-driver were having an altercation concerning the
      fare, which, terminating at this point in favour of the cabman, Mrs.
      Raddle came up tottering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lauk, Mary Ann! what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; said Mrs. Cluppins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s put me all over in such a tremble, Betsy,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Raddle.
      &lsquo;Raddle ain&rsquo;t like a man; he leaves everythink to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was scarcely fair upon the unfortunate Mr. Raddle, who had been
      thrust aside by his good lady in the commencement of the dispute, and
      peremptorily commanded to hold his tongue. He had no opportunity of
      defending himself, however, for Mrs. Raddle gave unequivocal signs of
      fainting; which, being perceived from the parlour window, Mrs. Bardell,
      Mrs. Sanders, the lodger, and the lodger&rsquo;s servant, darted precipitately
      out, and conveyed her into the house, all talking at the same time, and
      giving utterance to various expressions of pity and condolence, as if she
      were one of the most suffering mortals on earth. Being conveyed into the
      front parlour, she was there deposited on a sofa; and the lady from the
      first floor running up to the first floor, returned with a bottle of
      sal-volatile, which, holding Mrs. Raddle tight round the neck, she applied
      in all womanly kindness and pity to her nose, until that lady with many
      plunges and struggles was fain to declare herself decidedly better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, poor thing!&rsquo; said Mrs. Rogers, &lsquo;I know what her feelin&rsquo;s is, too
      well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, poor thing! so do I,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sanders; and then all the ladies
      moaned in unison, and said they knew what it was, and they pitied her from
      their hearts, they did. Even the lodger&rsquo;s little servant, who was thirteen
      years old and three feet high, murmured her sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what&rsquo;s been the matter?&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, what has decomposed you, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; inquired Mrs. Rogers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been a good deal flurried,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Raddle, in a reproachful
      manner. Thereupon the ladies cast indignant glances at Mr. Raddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, the fact is,&rsquo; said that unhappy gentleman, stepping forward, &lsquo;when
      we alighted at this door, a dispute arose with the driver of the cabrioily&mdash;&rsquo; 
      A loud scream from his wife, at the mention of this word, rendered all
      further explanation inaudible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better leave us to bring her round, Raddle,&rsquo; said Mrs. Cluppins.
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll never get better as long as you&rsquo;re here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      All the ladies concurred in this opinion; so Mr. Raddle was pushed out of
      the room, and requested to give himself an airing in the back yard. Which
      he did for about a quarter of an hour, when Mrs. Bardell announced to him
      with a solemn face that he might come in now, but that he must be very
      careful how he behaved towards his wife. She knew he didn&rsquo;t mean to be
      unkind; but Mary Ann was very far from strong, and, if he didn&rsquo;t take
      care, he might lose her when he least expected it, which would be a very
      dreadful reflection for him afterwards; and so on. All this, Mr. Raddle
      heard with great submission, and presently returned to the parlour in a
      most lamb-like manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Mrs. Rogers, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve never been
      introduced, I declare! Mr. Raddle, ma&rsquo;am; Mrs. Cluppins, ma&rsquo;am; Mrs.
      Raddle, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which is Mrs. Cluppins&rsquo;s sister,&rsquo; suggested Mrs. Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, indeed!&rsquo; said Mrs. Rogers graciously; for she was the lodger, and her
      servant was in waiting, so she was more gracious than intimate, in right
      of her position. &lsquo;Oh, indeed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Raddle smiled sweetly, Mr. Raddle bowed, and Mrs. Cluppins said, &lsquo;she
      was sure she was very happy to have an opportunity of being known to a
      lady which she had heerd so much in favour of, as Mrs. Rogers.&rsquo; A
      compliment which the last-named lady acknowledged with graceful
      condescension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Mr. Raddle,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure you ought to feel very
      much honoured at you and Tommy being the only gentlemen to escort so many
      ladies all the way to the Spaniards, at Hampstead. Don&rsquo;t you think he
      ought, Mrs. Rogers, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, certainly, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Rogers; after whom all the other
      ladies responded, &lsquo;Oh, certainly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I feel it, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Raddle, rubbing his hands, and
      evincing a slight tendency to brighten up a little. &lsquo;Indeed, to tell you
      the truth, I said, as we was a-coming along in the cabrioily&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the recapitulation of the word which awakened so many painful
      recollections, Mrs. Raddle applied her handkerchief to her eyes again, and
      uttered a half-suppressed scream; so that Mrs. Bardell frowned upon Mr.
      Raddle, to intimate that he had better not say anything more, and desired
      Mrs. Rogers&rsquo;s servant, with an air, to &lsquo;put the wine on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the signal for displaying the hidden treasures of the closet,
      which comprised sundry plates of oranges and biscuits, and a bottle of old
      crusted port&mdash;that at one-and-nine&mdash;with another of the
      celebrated East India sherry at fourteen-pence, which were all produced in
      honour of the lodger, and afforded unlimited satisfaction to everybody.
      After great consternation had been excited in the mind of Mrs. Cluppins,
      by an attempt on the part of Tommy to recount how he had been
      cross-examined regarding the cupboard then in action (which was
      fortunately nipped in the bud by his imbibing half a glass of the old
      crusted &lsquo;the wrong way,&rsquo; and thereby endangering his life for some
      seconds), the party walked forth in quest of a Hampstead stage. This was
      soon found, and in a couple of hours they all arrived safely in the
      Spaniards Tea-gardens, where the luckless Mr. Raddle&rsquo;s very first act
      nearly occasioned his good lady a relapse; it being neither more nor less
      than to order tea for seven, whereas (as the ladies one and all remarked),
      what could have been easier than for Tommy to have drank out of anybody&rsquo;s
      cup&mdash;or everybody&rsquo;s, if that was all&mdash;when the waiter wasn&rsquo;t
      looking, which would have saved one head of tea, and the tea just as good!
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there was no help for it, and the tea-tray came, with seven cups
      and saucers, and bread-and-butter on the same scale. Mrs. Bardell was
      unanimously voted into the chair, and Mrs. Rogers being stationed on her
      right hand, and Mrs. Raddle on her left, the meal proceeded with great
      merriment and success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How sweet the country is, to be sure!&rsquo; sighed Mrs. Rogers; &lsquo;I almost wish
      I lived in it always.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you wouldn&rsquo;t like that, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Bardell, rather hastily;
      for it was not at all advisable, with reference to the lodgings, to
      encourage such notions; &lsquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t like it, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I should think you was a deal too lively and sought after, to be
      content with the country, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said little Mrs. Cluppins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps I am, ma&rsquo;am. Perhaps I am,&rsquo; sighed the first-floor lodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For lone people as have got nobody to care for them, or take care of
      them, or as have been hurt in their mind, or that kind of thing,&rsquo; observed
      Mr. Raddle, plucking up a little cheerfulness, and looking round, &lsquo;the
      country is all very well. The country for a wounded spirit, they say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, of all things in the world that the unfortunate man could have said,
      any would have been preferable to this. Of course Mrs. Bardell burst into
      tears, and requested to be led from the table instantly; upon which the
      affectionate child began to cry too, most dismally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would anybody believe, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Raddle, turning fiercely to
      the first-floor lodger, &lsquo;that a woman could be married to such a unmanly
      creetur, which can tamper with a woman&rsquo;s feelings as he does, every hour
      in the day, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; remonstrated Mr. Raddle, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean anything, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t mean!&rsquo; repeated Mrs. Raddle, with great scorn and contempt.
      &lsquo;Go away. I can&rsquo;t bear the sight on you, you brute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must not flurry yourself, Mary Ann,&rsquo; interposed Mrs. Cluppins. &lsquo;You
      really must consider yourself, my dear, which you never do. Now go away,
      Raddle, there&rsquo;s a good soul, or you&rsquo;ll only aggravate her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better take your tea by yourself, Sir, indeed,&rsquo; said Mrs. Rogers,
      again applying the smelling-bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sanders, who, according to custom, was very busy with the
      bread-and-butter, expressed the same opinion, and Mr. Raddle quietly
      retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, there was a great hoisting up of Master Bardell, who was
      rather a large size for hugging, into his mother&rsquo;s arms, in which
      operation he got his boots in the tea-board, and occasioned some confusion
      among the cups and saucers. But that description of fainting fits, which
      is contagious among ladies, seldom lasts long; so when he had been well
      kissed, and a little cried over, Mrs. Bardell recovered, set him down
      again, wondering how she could have been so foolish, and poured out some
      more tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment, that the sound of approaching wheels was heard, and
      that the ladies, looking up, saw a hackney-coach stop at the garden gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More company!&rsquo; said Mrs. Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a gentleman,&rsquo; said Mrs. Raddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, if it ain&rsquo;t Mr. Jackson, the young man from Dodson and Fogg&rsquo;s!&rsquo; 
      cried Mrs. Bardell. &lsquo;Why, gracious! Surely Mr. Pickwick can&rsquo;t have paid
      the damages.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or hoffered marriage!&rsquo; said Mrs. Cluppins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, how slow the gentleman is,&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Rogers. &lsquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t
      he make haste!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the lady spoke these words, Mr. Jackson turned from the coach where he
      had been addressing some observations to a shabby man in black leggings,
      who had just emerged from the vehicle with a thick ash stick in his hand,
      and made his way to the place where the ladies were seated; winding his
      hair round the brim of his hat, as he came along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is anything the matter? Has anything taken place, Mr. Jackson?&rsquo; said Mrs.
      Bardell eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing whatever, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied Mr. Jackson. &lsquo;How de do, ladies? I have
      to ask pardon, ladies, for intruding&mdash;but the law, ladies&mdash;the
      law.&rsquo; With this apology Mr. Jackson smiled, made a comprehensive bow, and
      gave his hair another wind. Mrs. Rogers whispered Mrs. Raddle that he was
      really an elegant young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I called in Goswell Street,&rsquo; resumed Mr. Jackson, &lsquo;and hearing that you
      were here, from the slavey, took a coach and came on. Our people want you
      down in the city directly, Mrs. Bardell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor!&rsquo; ejaculated that lady, starting at the sudden nature of the
      communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr. Jackson, biting his lip. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very important and pressing
      business, which can&rsquo;t be postponed on any account. Indeed, Dodson
      expressly said so to me, and so did Fogg. I&rsquo;ve kept the coach on purpose
      for you to go back in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How very strange!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Bardell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies agreed that it <i>was </i> very strange, but were unanimously
      of opinion that it must be very important, or Dodson &amp; Fogg would
      never have sent; and further, that the business being urgent, she ought to
      repair to Dodson &amp; Fogg&rsquo;s without any delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a certain degree of pride and importance about being wanted by
      one&rsquo;s lawyers in such a monstrous hurry, that was by no means displeasing
      to Mrs. Bardell, especially as it might be reasonably supposed to enhance
      her consequence in the eyes of the first-floor lodger. She simpered a
      little, affected extreme vexation and hesitation, and at last arrived at
      the conclusion that she supposed she must go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But won&rsquo;t you refresh yourself after your walk, Mr. Jackson?&rsquo; said Mrs.
      Bardell persuasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, really there ain&rsquo;t much time to lose,&rsquo; replied Jackson; &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ve
      got a friend here,&rsquo; he continued, looking towards the man with the ash
      stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, ask your friend to come here, Sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell. &lsquo;Pray ask your
      friend here, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, thank&rsquo;ee, I&rsquo;d rather not,&rsquo; said Mr. Jackson, with some embarrassment
      of manner. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s not much used to ladies&rsquo; society, and it makes him
      bashful. If you&rsquo;ll order the waiter to deliver him anything short, he
      won&rsquo;t drink it off at once, won&rsquo;t he!&mdash;only try him!&rsquo; Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s
      fingers wandered playfully round his nose at this portion of his
      discourse, to warn his hearers that he was speaking ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter was at once despatched to the bashful gentleman, and the
      bashful gentleman took something; Mr. Jackson also took something, and the
      ladies took something, for hospitality&rsquo;s sake. Mr. Jackson then said he
      was afraid it was time to go; upon which, Mrs. Sanders, Mrs. Cluppins, and
      Tommy (who it was arranged should accompany Mrs. Bardell, leaving the
      others to Mr. Raddle&rsquo;s protection), got into the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isaac,&rsquo; said Jackson, as Mrs. Bardell prepared to get in, looking up at
      the man with the ash stick, who was seated on the box, smoking a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is Mrs. Bardell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I know&rsquo;d that long ago,&rsquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bardell got in, Mr. Jackson got in after her, and away they drove.
      Mrs. Bardell could not help ruminating on what Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s friend had
      said. Shrewd creatures, those lawyers. Lord bless us, how they find people
      out!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sad thing about these costs of our people&rsquo;s, ain&rsquo;t it,&rsquo; said Jackson,
      when Mrs. Cluppins and Mrs. Sanders had fallen asleep; &lsquo;your bill of
      costs, I mean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry they can&rsquo;t get them,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Bardell. &lsquo;But if you
      law gentlemen do these things on speculation, why you must get a loss now
      and then, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You gave them a <i>cognovit </i>for the amount of your costs, after the
      trial, I&rsquo;m told!&rsquo; said Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Just as a matter of form,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Bardell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; replied Jackson drily. &lsquo;Quite a matter of form. Quite.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On they drove, and Mrs. Bardell fell asleep. She was awakened, after some
      time, by the stopping of the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless us!&rsquo; said the lady. &lsquo;Are we at Freeman&rsquo;s Court?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;re not going quite so far,&rsquo; replied Jackson. &lsquo;Have the goodness to
      step out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bardell, not yet thoroughly awake, complied. It was a curious place:
      a large wall, with a gate in the middle, and a gas-light burning inside.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/20336m.jpg" alt="20336m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20336.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, ladies,&rsquo; cried the man with the ash stick, looking into the coach,
      and shaking Mrs. Sanders to wake her, &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; Rousing her friend, Mrs.
      Sanders alighted. Mrs. Bardell, leaning on Jackson&rsquo;s arm, and leading
      Tommy by the hand, had already entered the porch. They followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room they turned into was even more odd-looking than the porch. Such a
      number of men standing about! And they stared so!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What place is this?&rsquo; inquired Mrs. Bardell, pausing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only one of our public offices,&rsquo; replied Jackson, hurrying her through a
      door, and looking round to see that the other women were following. &lsquo;Look
      sharp, Isaac!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Safe and sound,&rsquo; replied the man with the ash stick. The door swung
      heavily after them, and they descended a small flight of steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here we are at last. All right and tight, Mrs. Bardell!&rsquo; said Jackson,
      looking exultingly round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell, with a palpitating heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just this,&rsquo; replied Jackson, drawing her a little on one side; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be
      frightened, Mrs. Bardell. There never was a more delicate man than Dodson,
      ma&rsquo;am, or a more humane man than Fogg. It was their duty in the way of
      business, to take you in execution for them costs; but they were anxious
      to spare your feelings as much as they could. What a comfort it must be,
      to you, to think how it&rsquo;s been done! This is the Fleet, ma&rsquo;am. Wish you
      good-night, Mrs. Bardell. Good-night, Tommy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Jackson hurried away in company with the man with the ash stick another
      man, with a key in his hand, who had been looking on, led the bewildered
      female to a second short flight of steps leading to a doorway. Mrs.
      Bardell screamed violently; Tommy roared; Mrs. Cluppins shrunk within
      herself; and Mrs. Sanders made off, without more ado. For there stood the
      injured Mr. Pickwick, taking his nightly allowance of air; and beside him
      leant Samuel Weller, who, seeing Mrs. Bardell, took his hat off with mock
      reverence, while his master turned indignantly on his heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t bother the woman,&rsquo; said the turnkey to Weller; &lsquo;she&rsquo;s just come
      in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A prisoner!&rsquo; said Sam, quickly replacing his hat. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s the plaintives?
      What for? Speak up, old feller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dodson and Fogg,&rsquo; replied the man; &lsquo;execution on <i>cognovit </i>for
      costs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, Job, Job!&rsquo; shouted Sam, dashing into the passage. &lsquo;Run to Mr.
      Perker&rsquo;s, Job. I want him directly. I see some good in this. Here&rsquo;s a
      game. Hooray! vere&rsquo;s the gov&rsquo;nor?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no reply to these inquiries, for Job had started furiously
      off, the instant he received his commission, and Mrs. Bardell had fainted
      in real downright earnest.

      EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES&mdash;MR. PICKWICK&rsquo;S BENEVOLENCE PROVES
      STRONGER THAN HIS OBSTINACY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>ob Trotter,
      abating nothing of his speed, ran up Holborn, sometimes in the middle of
      the road, sometimes on the pavement, sometimes in the gutter, as the
      chances of getting along varied with the press of men, women, children,
      and coaches, in each division of the thoroughfare, and, regardless of all
      obstacles stopped not for an instant until he reached the gate of Gray&rsquo;s
      Inn. Notwithstanding all the expedition he had used, however, the gate had
      been closed a good half-hour when he reached it, and by the time he had
      discovered Mr. Perker&rsquo;s laundress, who lived with a married daughter, who
      had bestowed her hand upon a non-resident waiter, who occupied the
      one-pair of some number in some street closely adjoining to some brewery
      somewhere behind Gray&rsquo;s Inn Lane, it was within fifteen minutes of closing
      the prison for the night. Mr. Lowten had still to be ferreted out from the
      back parlour of the Magpie and Stump; and Job had scarcely accomplished
      this object, and communicated Sam Weller&rsquo;s message, when the clock struck
      ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There,&rsquo; said Lowten, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s too late now. You can&rsquo;t get in to-night;
      you&rsquo;ve got the key of the street, my friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind me,&rsquo; replied Job. &lsquo;I can sleep anywhere. But won&rsquo;t it be
      better to see Mr. Perker to-night, so that we may be there, the first
      thing in the morning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; responded Lowten, after a little consideration, &lsquo;if it was in
      anybody else&rsquo;s case, Perker wouldn&rsquo;t be best pleased at my going up to his
      house; but as it&rsquo;s Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s, I think I may venture to take a cab and
      charge it to the office.&rsquo; Deciding on this line of conduct, Mr. Lowten
      took up his hat, and begging the assembled company to appoint a
      deputy-chairman during his temporary absence, led the way to the nearest
      coach-stand. Summoning the cab of most promising appearance, he directed
      the driver to repair to Montague Place, Russell Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Perker had had a dinner-party that day, as was testified by the
      appearance of lights in the drawing-room windows, the sound of an improved
      grand piano, and an improvable cabinet voice issuing therefrom, and a
      rather overpowering smell of meat which pervaded the steps and entry. In
      fact, a couple of very good country agencies happening to come up to town,
      at the same time, an agreeable little party had been got together to meet
      them, comprising Mr. Snicks, the Life Office Secretary, Mr. Prosee, the
      eminent counsel, three solicitors, one commissioner of bankrupts, a
      special pleader from the Temple, a small-eyed peremptory young gentleman,
      his pupil, who had written a lively book about the law of demises, with a
      vast quantity of marginal notes and references; and several other eminent
      and distinguished personages. From this society, little Mr. Perker
      detached himself, on his clerk being announced in a whisper; and repairing
      to the dining-room, there found Mr. Lowten and Job Trotter looking very
      dim and shadowy by the light of a kitchen candle, which the gentleman who
      condescended to appear in plush shorts and cottons for a quarterly
      stipend, had, with a becoming contempt for the clerk and all things
      appertaining to &lsquo;the office,&rsquo; placed upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Lowten,&rsquo; said little Mr. Perker, shutting the door, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the
      matter? No important letter come in a parcel, is there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Sir,&rsquo; replied Lowten. &lsquo;This is a messenger from Mr. Pickwick, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From Pickwick, eh?&rsquo; said the little man, turning quickly to Job. &lsquo;Well,
      what is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dodson and Fogg have taken Mrs. Bardell in execution for her costs, Sir,&rsquo; 
      said Job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; exclaimed Perker, putting his hands in his pockets, and reclining
      against the sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Job. &lsquo;It seems they got a cognovit out of her, for the amount
      of &lsquo;em, directly after the trial.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By Jove!&rsquo; said Perker, taking both hands out of his pockets, and striking
      the knuckles of his right against the palm of his left, emphatically,
      &lsquo;those are the cleverest scamps I ever had anything to do with!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The sharpest practitioners I ever knew, Sir,&rsquo; observed Lowten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sharp!&rsquo; echoed Perker. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no knowing where to have them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very true, Sir, there is not,&rsquo; replied Lowten; and then, both master and
      man pondered for a few seconds, with animated countenances, as if they
      were reflecting upon one of the most beautiful and ingenious discoveries
      that the intellect of man had ever made. When they had in some measure
      recovered from their trance of admiration, Job Trotter discharged himself
      of the rest of his commission. Perker nodded his head thoughtfully, and
      pulled out his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At ten precisely, I will be there,&rsquo; said the little man. &lsquo;Sam is quite
      right. Tell him so. Will you take a glass of wine, Lowten?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No, thank you, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean yes, I think,&rsquo; said the little man, turning to the sideboard for
      a decanter and glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lowten <i>did </i>mean yes, he said no more on the subject, but
      inquired of Job, in an audible whisper, whether the portrait of Perker,
      which hung opposite the fireplace, wasn&rsquo;t a wonderful likeness, to which
      Job of course replied that it was. The wine being by this time poured out,
      Lowten drank to Mrs. Perker and the children, and Job to Perker. The
      gentleman in the plush shorts and cottons considering it no part of his
      duty to show the people from the office out, consistently declined to
      answer the bell, and they showed themselves out. The attorney betook
      himself to his drawing-room, the clerk to the Magpie and Stump, and Job to
      Covent Garden Market to spend the night in a vegetable basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Punctually at the appointed hour next morning, the good-humoured little
      attorney tapped at Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s door, which was opened with great
      alacrity by Sam Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Perker, sir,&rsquo; said Sam, announcing the visitor to Mr. Pickwick, who
      was sitting at the window in a thoughtful attitude. &lsquo;Wery glad you&rsquo;ve
      looked in accidentally, Sir. I rather think the gov&rsquo;nor wants to have a
      word and a half with you, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Perker bestowed a look of intelligence on Sam, intimating that he
      understood he was not to say he had been sent for; and beckoning him to
      approach, whispered briefly in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that &lsquo;ere, Sir?&rsquo; said Sam, starting back in excessive
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perker nodded and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samuel Weller looked at the little lawyer, then at Mr. Pickwick, then
      at the ceiling, then at Perker again; grinned, laughed outright, and
      finally, catching up his hat from the carpet, without further explanation,
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does this mean?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, looking at Perker with
      astonishment. &lsquo;What has put Sam into this extraordinary state?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, nothing, nothing,&rsquo; replied Perker. &lsquo;Come, my dear Sir, draw up your
      chair to the table. I have a good deal to say to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What papers are those?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, as the little man
      deposited on the table a small bundle of documents tied with red tape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The papers in Bardell and Pickwick,&rsquo; replied Perker, undoing the knot
      with his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick grated the legs of his chair against the ground; and throwing
      himself into it, folded his hands and looked sternly&mdash;if Mr. Pickwick
      ever could look sternly&mdash;at his legal friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t like to hear the name of the cause?&rsquo; said the little man, still
      busying himself with the knot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I do not indeed,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sorry for that,&rsquo; resumed Perker, &lsquo;because it will form the subject of our
      conversation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would rather that the subject should be never mentioned between us,
      Perker,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Pickwick hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pooh, pooh, my dear Sir,&rsquo; said the little man, untying the bundle, and
      glancing eagerly at Mr. Pickwick out of the corners of his eyes. &lsquo;It must
      be mentioned. I have come here on purpose. Now, are you ready to hear what
      I have to say, my dear Sir? No hurry; if you are not, I can wait. I have
      this morning&rsquo;s paper here. Your time shall be mine. There!&rsquo; Hereupon, the
      little man threw one leg over the other, and made a show of beginning to
      read with great composure and application.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with a sigh, but softening into a smile
      at the same time. &lsquo;Say what you have to say; it&rsquo;s the old story, I
      suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With a difference, my dear Sir; with a difference,&rsquo; rejoined Perker,
      deliberately folding up the paper and putting it into his pocket again.
      &lsquo;Mrs. Bardell, the plaintiff in the action, is within these walls, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it,&rsquo; was Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; retorted Perker. &lsquo;And you know how she comes here, I suppose;
      I mean on what grounds, and at whose suit?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; at least I have heard Sam&rsquo;s account of the matter,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Pickwick, with affected carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam&rsquo;s account of the matter,&rsquo; replied Perker, &lsquo;is, I will venture to say,
      a perfectly correct one. Well now, my dear Sir, the first question I have
      to ask, is, whether this woman is to remain here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To remain here!&rsquo; echoed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To remain here, my dear Sir,&rsquo; rejoined Perker, leaning back in his chair
      and looking steadily at his client.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can you ask me?&rsquo; said that gentleman. &lsquo;It rests with Dodson and Fogg;
      you know that very well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know nothing of the kind,&rsquo; retorted Perker firmly. &lsquo;It does <i>not </i>rest
      with Dodson and Fogg; you know the men, my dear Sir, as well as I do. It
      rests solely, wholly, and entirely with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With me!&rsquo; ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, rising nervously from his chair, and
      reseating himself directly afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man gave a double-knock on the lid of his snuff-box, opened it,
      took a great pinch, shut it up again, and repeated the words, &lsquo;With you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, my dear Sir,&rsquo; resumed the little man, who seemed to gather
      confidence from the snuff&mdash;&lsquo;I say, that her speedy liberation or
      perpetual imprisonment rests with you, and with you alone. Hear me out, my
      dear Sir, if you please, and do not be so very energetic, for it will only
      put you into a perspiration and do no good whatever. I say,&rsquo; continued
      Perker, checking off each position on a different finger, as he laid it
      down&mdash;&lsquo;I say that nobody but you can rescue her from this den of
      wretchedness; and that you can only do that, by paying the costs of this
      suit&mdash;both of plaintive and defendant&mdash;into the hands of these
      Freeman Court sharks. Now pray be quiet, my dear sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick, whose face had been undergoing most surprising changes
      during this speech, and was evidently on the verge of a strong burst of
      indignation, calmed his wrath as well as he could. Perker, strengthening
      his argumentative powers with another pinch of snuff, proceeded&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have seen the woman, this morning. By paying the costs, you can obtain
      a full release and discharge from the damages; and further&mdash;this I
      know is a far greater object of consideration with you, my dear sir&mdash;a
      voluntary statement, under her hand, in the form of a letter to me, that
      this business was, from the very first, fomented, and encouraged, and
      brought about, by these men, Dodson and Fogg; that she deeply regrets ever
      having been the instrument of annoyance or injury to you; and that she
      entreats me to intercede with you, and implore your pardon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I pay her costs for her,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick indignantly. &lsquo;A valuable
      document, indeed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No &ldquo;if&rdquo; in the case, my dear Sir,&rsquo; said Perker triumphantly. &lsquo;There is
      the very letter I speak of. Brought to my office by another woman at nine
      o&rsquo;clock this morning, before I had set foot in this place, or held any
      communication with Mrs. Bardell, upon my honour.&rsquo; Selecting the letter
      from the bundle, the little lawyer laid it at Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s elbow, and
      took snuff for two consecutive minutes, without winking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this all you have to say to me?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not quite,&rsquo; replied Perker. &lsquo;I cannot undertake to say, at this moment,
      whether the wording of the cognovit, the nature of the ostensible
      consideration, and the proof we can get together about the whole conduct
      of the suit, will be sufficient to justify an indictment for conspiracy. I
      fear not, my dear Sir; they are too clever for that, I doubt. I do mean to
      say, however, that the whole facts, taken together, will be sufficient to
      justify you, in the minds of all reasonable men. And now, my dear Sir, I
      put it to you. This one hundred and fifty pounds, or whatever it may be&mdash;take
      it in round numbers&mdash;is nothing to you. A jury had decided against
      you; well, their verdict is wrong, but still they decided as they thought
      right, and it <i>is</i> against you. You have now an opportunity, on easy
      terms, of placing yourself in a much higher position than you ever could,
      by remaining here; which would only be imputed, by people who didn&rsquo;t know
      you, to sheer dogged, wrongheaded, brutal obstinacy; nothing else, my dear
      Sir, believe me. Can you hesitate to avail yourself of it, when it
      restores you to your friends, your old pursuits, your health and
      amusements; when it liberates your faithful and attached servant, whom you
      otherwise doom to imprisonment for the whole of your life; and above all,
      when it enables you to take the very magnanimous revenge&mdash;which I
      know, my dear sir, is one after your own heart&mdash;of releasing this
      woman from a scene of misery and debauchery, to which no man should ever
      be consigned, if I had my will, but the infliction of which on any woman,
      is even more frightful and barbarous. Now I ask you, my dear sir, not only
      as your legal adviser, but as your very true friend, will you let slip the
      occasion of attaining all these objects, and doing all this good, for the
      paltry consideration of a few pounds finding their way into the pockets of
      a couple of rascals, to whom it makes no manner of difference, except that
      the more they gain, the more they&rsquo;ll seek, and so the sooner be led into
      some piece of knavery that must end in a crash? I have put these
      considerations to you, my dear Sir, very feebly and imperfectly, but I ask
      you to think of them. Turn them over in your mind as long as you please. I
      wait here most patiently for your answer.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <p>
      Before Mr. Pickwick could reply, before Mr. Perker had taken one twentieth
      part of the snuff with which so unusually long an address imperatively
      required to be followed up, there was a low murmuring of voices outside,
      and then a hesitating knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear, dear,&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, who had been evidently roused by his
      friend&rsquo;s appeal; &lsquo;what an annoyance that door is! Who is that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Me, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam Weller, putting in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t speak to you just now, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;I am engaged at
      this moment, Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beg your pardon, Sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Weller. &lsquo;But here&rsquo;s a lady here, Sir,
      as says she&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; wery partickler to disclose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t see any lady,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, whose mind was filled with
      visions of Mrs. Bardell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t make too sure o&rsquo; that, Sir,&rsquo; urged Mr. Weller, shaking his
      head. &lsquo;If you know&rsquo;d who was near, sir, I rayther think you&rsquo;d change your
      note; as the hawk remarked to himself vith a cheerful laugh, ven he heerd
      the robin-redbreast a-singin&rsquo; round the corner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is it?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you see her, Sir?&rsquo; asked Mr. Weller, holding the door in his hand as
      if he had some curious live animal on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose I must,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking at Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well then, all in to begin!&rsquo; cried Sam. &lsquo;Sound the gong, draw up the
      curtain, and enter the two conspiraytors.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Sam Weller spoke, he threw the door open, and there rushed tumultuously
      into the room, Mr. Nathaniel Winkle, leading after him by the hand, the
      identical young lady who at Dingley Dell had worn the boots with the fur
      round the tops, and who, now a very pleasing compound of blushes and
      confusion, and lilac silk, and a smart bonnet, and a rich lace veil,
      looked prettier than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Arabella Allen!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, rising from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle, dropping on his knees. &lsquo;Mrs. Winkle. Pardon, my
      dear friend, pardon!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses, and
      perhaps would not have done so, but for the corroborative testimony
      afforded by the smiling countenance of Perker, and the bodily presence, in
      the background, of Sam and the pretty housemaid; who appeared to
      contemplate the proceedings with the liveliest satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Mr. Pickwick!&rsquo; said Arabella, in a low voice, as if alarmed at the
      silence. &lsquo;Can you forgive my imprudence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick returned no verbal response to this appeal; but he took off
      his spectacles in great haste, and seizing both the young lady&rsquo;s hands in
      his, kissed her a great number of times&mdash;perhaps a greater number
      than was absolutely necessary&mdash;and then, still retaining one of her
      hands, told Mr. Winkle he was an audacious young dog, and bade him get up.
      This, Mr. Winkle, who had been for some seconds scratching his nose with
      the brim of his hat, in a penitent manner, did; whereupon Mr. Pickwick
      slapped him on the back several times, and then shook hands heartily with
      Perker, who, not to be behind-hand in the compliments of the occasion,
      saluted both the bride and the pretty housemaid with right good-will, and,
      having wrung Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s hand most cordially, wound up his demonstrations
      of joy by taking snuff enough to set any half-dozen men with
      ordinarily-constructed noses, a-sneezing for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, my dear girl,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;how has all this come about?
      Come! Sit down, and let me hear it all. How well she looks, doesn&rsquo;t she,
      Perker?&rsquo; added Mr. Pickwick, surveying Arabella&rsquo;s face with a look of as
      much pride and exultation, as if she had been his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Delightful, my dear Sir,&rsquo; replied the little man. &lsquo;If I were not a
      married man myself, I should be disposed to envy you, you dog.&rsquo; Thus
      expressing himself, the little lawyer gave Mr. Winkle a poke in the chest,
      which that gentleman reciprocated; after which they both laughed very
      loudly, but not so loudly as Mr. Samuel Weller, who had just relieved his
      feelings by kissing the pretty housemaid under cover of the cupboard door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can never be grateful enough to you, Sam, I am sure,&rsquo; said Arabella,
      with the sweetest smile imaginable. &lsquo;I shall not forget your exertions in
      the garden at Clifton.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; wotever about it, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;I only assisted
      natur, ma&rsquo;am; as the doctor said to the boy&rsquo;s mother, after he&rsquo;d bled him
      to death.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mary, my dear, sit down,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, cutting short these
      compliments. &lsquo;Now then; how long have you been married, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arabella looked bashfully at her lord and master, who replied, &lsquo;Only three
      days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only three days, eh?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Why, what have you been doing
      these three months?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, to be sure!&rsquo; interposed Perker; &lsquo;come, account for this idleness. You
      see Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s only astonishment is, that it wasn&rsquo;t all over, months
      ago.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why the fact is,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle, looking at his blushing young wife,
      &lsquo;that I could not persuade Bella to run away, for a long time. And when I
      had persuaded her, it was a long time more before we could find an
      opportunity. Mary had to give a month&rsquo;s warning, too, before she could
      leave her place next door, and we couldn&rsquo;t possibly have done it without
      her assistance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon my word,&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, who by this time had resumed his
      spectacles, and was looking from Arabella to Winkle, and from Winkle to
      Arabella, with as much delight depicted in his countenance as
      warmheartedness and kindly feeling can communicate to the human face&mdash;&lsquo;upon
      my word! you seem to have been very systematic in your proceedings. And is
      your brother acquainted with all this, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no, no,&rsquo; replied Arabella, changing colour. &lsquo;Dear Mr. Pickwick, he
      must only know it from you&mdash;from your lips alone. He is so violent,
      so prejudiced, and has been so&mdash;so anxious in behalf of his friend,
      Mr. Sawyer,&rsquo; added Arabella, looking down, &lsquo;that I fear the consequences
      dreadfully.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, to be sure,&rsquo; said Perker gravely. &lsquo;You must take this matter in hand
      for them, my dear sir. These young men will respect you, when they would
      listen to nobody else. You must prevent mischief, my dear Sir. Hot blood,
      hot blood.&rsquo; And the little man took a warning pinch, and shook his head
      doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You forget, my love,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick gently, &lsquo;you forget that I am a
      prisoner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed I do not, my dear Sir,&rsquo; replied Arabella. &lsquo;I never have
      forgotten it. I have never ceased to think how great your sufferings must
      have been in this shocking place. But I hoped that what no consideration
      for yourself would induce you to do, a regard to our happiness might. If
      my brother hears of this, first, from you, I feel certain we shall be
      reconciled. He is my only relation in the world, Mr. Pickwick, and unless
      you plead for me, I fear I have lost even him. I have done wrong, very,
      very wrong, I know.&rsquo; Here poor Arabella hid her face in her handkerchief,
      and wept bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s nature was a good deal worked upon, by these same tears;
      but when Mrs. Winkle, drying her eyes, took to coaxing and entreating in
      the sweetest tones of a very sweet voice, he became particularly restless,
      and evidently undecided how to act, as was evinced by sundry nervous
      rubbings of his spectacle-glasses, nose, tights, head, and gaiters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking advantage of these symptoms of indecision, Mr. Perker (to whom, it
      appeared, the young couple had driven straight that morning) urged with
      legal point and shrewdness that Mr. Winkle, senior, was still unacquainted
      with the important rise in life&rsquo;s flight of steps which his son had taken;
      that the future expectations of the said son depended entirely upon the
      said Winkle, senior, continuing to regard him with undiminished feelings
      of affection and attachment, which it was very unlikely he would, if this
      great event were long kept a secret from him; that Mr. Pickwick, repairing
      to Bristol to seek Mr. Allen, might, with equal reason, repair to
      Birmingham to seek Mr. Winkle, senior; lastly, that Mr. Winkle, senior,
      had good right and title to consider Mr. Pickwick as in some degree the
      guardian and adviser of his son, and that it consequently behoved that
      gentleman, and was indeed due to his personal character, to acquaint the
      aforesaid Winkle, senior, personally, and by word of mouth, with the whole
      circumstances of the case, and with the share he had taken in the
      transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass arrived, most opportunely, in this stage of
      the pleadings, and as it was necessary to explain to them all that had
      occurred, together with the various reasons pro and con, the whole of the
      arguments were gone over again, after which everybody urged every argument
      in his own way, and at his own length. And, at last, Mr. Pickwick, fairly
      argued and remonstrated out of all his resolutions, and being in imminent
      danger of being argued and remonstrated out of his wits, caught Arabella
      in his arms, and declaring that she was a very amiable creature, and that
      he didn&rsquo;t know how it was, but he had always been very fond of her from
      the first, said he could never find it in his heart to stand in the way of
      young people&rsquo;s happiness, and they might do with him as they pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller&rsquo;s first act, on hearing this concession, was to despatch Job
      Trotter to the illustrious Mr. Pell, with an authority to deliver to the
      bearer the formal discharge which his prudent parent had had the foresight
      to leave in the hands of that learned gentleman, in case it should be, at
      any time, required on an emergency; his next proceeding was, to invest his
      whole stock of ready-money in the purchase of five-and-twenty gallons of
      mild porter, which he himself dispensed on the racket-ground to everybody
      who would partake of it; this done, he hurra&rsquo;d in divers parts of the
      building until he lost his voice, and then quietly relapsed into his usual
      collected and philosophical condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      At three o&rsquo;clock that afternoon, Mr. Pickwick took a last look at his
      little room, and made his way, as well as he could, through the throng of
      debtors who pressed eagerly forward to shake him by the hand, until he
      reached the lodge steps. He turned here, to look about him, and his eye
      lightened as he did so. In all the crowd of wan, emaciated faces, he saw
      not one which was not happier for his sympathy and charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perker,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, beckoning one young man towards him, &lsquo;this is
      Mr. Jingle, whom I spoke to you about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good, my dear Sir,&rsquo; replied Perker, looking hard at Jingle. &lsquo;You
      will see me again, young man, to-morrow. I hope you may live to remember
      and feel deeply, what I shall have to communicate, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jingle bowed respectfully, trembled very much as he took Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      proffered hand, and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Job you know, I think?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, presenting that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know the rascal,&rsquo; replied Perker good-humouredly. &lsquo;See after your
      friend, and be in the way to-morrow at one. Do you hear? Now, is there
      anything more?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;You have delivered the little parcel I
      gave you for your old landlord, Sam?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have, Sir,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;He bust out a-cryin&rsquo;, Sir, and said you wos
      wery gen&rsquo;rous and thoughtful, and he only wished you could have him
      innockilated for a gallopin&rsquo; consumption, for his old friend as had lived
      here so long wos dead, and he&rsquo;d noweres to look for another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor fellow, poor fellow!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;God bless you, my friends!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Pickwick uttered this adieu, the crowd raised a loud shout. Many
      among them were pressing forward to shake him by the hand again, when he
      drew his arm through Perker&rsquo;s, and hurried from the prison, far more sad
      and melancholy, for the moment, than when he had first entered it. Alas!
      how many sad and unhappy beings had he left behind!
    </p>
    <p>
      A happy evening was that for at least one party in the George and Vulture;
      and light and cheerful were two of the hearts that emerged from its
      hospitable door next morning. The owners thereof were Mr. Pickwick and Sam
      Weller, the former of whom was speedily deposited inside a comfortable
      post-coach, with a little dickey behind, in which the latter mounted with
      great agility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; called out Mr. Weller to his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Sam,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, thrusting his head out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish them horses had been three months and better in the Fleet, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Sam?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wy, Sir,&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Weller, rubbing his hands, &lsquo;how they would go if
      they had been!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER XLVIII. RELATES HOW MR. PICKWICK, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF SAMUEL
      WELLER, ESSAYED TO SOFTEN THE HEART OF MR. BENJAMIN ALLEN, AND TO MOLLIFY
      THE WRATH OF MR. ROBERT SAWYER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Ben Allen and
      Mr. Bob Sawyer sat together in the little surgery behind the shop,
      discussing minced veal and future prospects, when the discourse, not
      unnaturally, turned upon the practice acquired by Bob the aforesaid, and
      his present chances of deriving a competent independence from the
      honourable profession to which he had devoted himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which, I think,&rsquo; observed Mr. Bob Sawyer, pursuing the thread of the
      subject&mdash;&lsquo;which, I think, Ben, are rather dubious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s rather dubious?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Ben Allen, at the same time
      sharpening his intellect with a draught of beer. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s dubious?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, the chances,&rsquo; responded Mr. Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I forgot,&rsquo; said Mr. Ben Allen. &lsquo;The beer has reminded me that I forgot,
      Bob&mdash;yes; they <i>are </i>dubious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful how the poor people patronise me,&rsquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer
      reflectively. &lsquo;They knock me up, at all hours of the night; they take
      medicine to an extent which I should have conceived impossible; they put
      on blisters and leeches with a perseverance worthy of a better cause; they
      make additions to their families, in a manner which is quite awful. Six of
      those last-named little promissory notes, all due on the same day, Ben,
      and all intrusted to me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very gratifying, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; said Mr. Ben Allen, holding his plate
      for some more minced veal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, very,&rsquo; replied Bob; &lsquo;only not quite so much so as the confidence of
      patients with a shilling or two to spare would be. This business was
      capitally described in the advertisement, Ben. It is a practice, a very
      extensive practice&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bob,&rsquo; said Mr. Ben Allen, laying down his knife and fork, and fixing his
      eyes on the visage of his friend, &lsquo;Bob, I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must make yourself, with as little delay as possible, master of
      Arabella&rsquo;s one thousand pounds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three per cent. consolidated bank annuities, now standing in her name in
      the book or books of the governor and company of the Bank of England,&rsquo; 
      added Bob Sawyer, in legal phraseology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly so,&rsquo; said Ben. &lsquo;She has it when she comes of age, or marries. She
      wants a year of coming of age, and if you plucked up a spirit she needn&rsquo;t
      want a month of being married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a very charming and delightful creature,&rsquo; quoth Mr. Robert Sawyer,
      in reply; &lsquo;and has only one fault that I know of, Ben. It happens,
      unfortunately, that that single blemish is a want of taste. She don&rsquo;t like
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion that she don&rsquo;t know what she does like,&rsquo; said Mr. Ben
      Allen contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps not,&rsquo; remarked Mr. Bob Sawyer. &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s my opinion that she does
      know what she doesn&rsquo;t like, and that&rsquo;s of more importance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish,&rsquo; said Mr. Ben Allen, setting his teeth together, and speaking
      more like a savage warrior who fed on raw wolf&rsquo;s flesh which he carved
      with his fingers, than a peaceable young gentleman who ate minced veal
      with a knife and fork&mdash;&lsquo;I wish I knew whether any rascal really has
      been tampering with her, and attempting to engage her affections. I think
      I should assassinate him, Bob.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d put a bullet in him, if I found him out,&rsquo; said Mr. Sawyer, stopping
      in the course of a long draught of beer, and looking malignantly out of
      the porter pot. &lsquo;If that didn&rsquo;t do his business, I&rsquo;d extract it
      afterwards, and kill him that way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Benjamin Allen gazed abstractedly on his friend for some minutes in
      silence, and then said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have never proposed to her, point-blank, Bob?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. Because I saw it would be of no use,&rsquo; replied Mr. Robert Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall do it, before you are twenty-four hours older,&rsquo; retorted Ben,
      with desperate calmness. &lsquo;She shall have you, or I&rsquo;ll know the reason why.
      I&rsquo;ll exert my authority.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer, &lsquo;we shall see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall see, my friend,&rsquo; replied Mr. Ben Allen fiercely. He paused for a
      few seconds, and added in a voice broken by emotion, &lsquo;You have loved her
      from a child, my friend. You loved her when we were boys at school
      together, and, even then, she was wayward and slighted your young
      feelings. Do you recollect, with all the eagerness of a child&rsquo;s love, one
      day pressing upon her acceptance, two small caraway-seed biscuits and one
      sweet apple, neatly folded into a circular parcel with the leaf of a
      copy-book?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do,&rsquo; replied Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She slighted that, I think?&rsquo; said Ben Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She did,&rsquo; rejoined Bob. &lsquo;She said I had kept the parcel so long in the
      pockets of my corduroys, that the apple was unpleasantly warm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I remember,&rsquo; said Mr. Allen gloomily. &lsquo;Upon which we ate it ourselves, in
      alternate bites.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob Sawyer intimated his recollection of the circumstance last alluded to,
      by a melancholy frown; and the two friends remained for some time
      absorbed, each in his own meditations.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these observations were being exchanged between Mr. Bob Sawyer and
      Mr. Benjamin Allen; and while the boy in the gray livery, marvelling at
      the unwonted prolongation of the dinner, cast an anxious look, from time
      to time, towards the glass door, distracted by inward misgivings regarding
      the amount of minced veal which would be ultimately reserved for his
      individual cravings; there rolled soberly on through the streets of
      Bristol, a private fly, painted of a sad green colour, drawn by a chubby
      sort of brown horse, and driven by a surly-looking man with his legs
      dressed like the legs of a groom, and his body attired in the coat of a
      coachman. Such appearances are common to many vehicles belonging to, and
      maintained by, old ladies of economic habits; and in this vehicle sat an
      old lady who was its mistress and proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Martin!&rsquo; said the old lady, calling to the surly man, out of the front
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said the surly man, touching his hat to the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Sawyer&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was going there,&rsquo; said the surly man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady nodded the satisfaction which this proof of the surly man&rsquo;s
      foresight imparted to her feelings; and the surly man giving a smart lash
      to the chubby horse, they all repaired to Mr. Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Martin!&rsquo; said the old lady, when the fly stopped at the door of Mr.
      Robert Sawyer, late Nockemorf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ask the lad to step out, and mind the horse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to mind the horse myself,&rsquo; said Martin, laying his whip on the
      roof of the fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t permit it, on any account,&rsquo; said the old lady; &lsquo;your testimony
      will be very important, and I must take you into the house with me. You
      must not stir from my side during the whole interview. Do you hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hear,&rsquo; replied Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well; what are you stopping for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; replied Martin. So saying, the surly man leisurely descended
      from the wheel, on which he had been poising himself on the tops of the
      toes of his right foot, and having summoned the boy in the gray livery,
      opened the coach door, flung down the steps, and thrusting in a hand
      enveloped in a dark wash-leather glove, pulled out the old lady with as
      much unconcern in his manner as if she were a bandbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; exclaimed the old lady. &lsquo;I am so flurried, now I have got here,
      Martin, that I&rsquo;m all in a tremble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Martin coughed behind the dark wash-leather gloves, but expressed no
      sympathy; so the old lady, composing herself, trotted up Mr. Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s
      steps, and Mr. Martin followed. Immediately on the old lady&rsquo;s entering the
      shop, Mr. Benjamin Allen and Mr. Bob Sawyer, who had been putting the
      spirits-and-water out of sight, and upsetting nauseous drugs to take off
      the smell of the tobacco smoke, issued hastily forth in a transport of
      pleasure and affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear aunt,&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Ben Allen, &lsquo;how kind of you to look in upon
      us! Mr. Sawyer, aunt; my friend Mr. Bob Sawyer whom I have spoken to you
      about, regarding&mdash;you know, aunt.&rsquo; And here Mr. Ben Allen, who was
      not at the moment extraordinarily sober, added the word &lsquo;Arabella,&rsquo; in
      what was meant to be a whisper, but which was an especially audible and
      distinct tone of speech which nobody could avoid hearing, if anybody were
      so disposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Benjamin,&rsquo; said the old lady, struggling with a great shortness
      of breath, and trembling from head to foot, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be alarmed, my dear,
      but I think I had better speak to Mr. Sawyer, alone, for a moment. Only
      for one moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bob,&rsquo; said Mr. Allen, &lsquo;will you take my aunt into the surgery?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; responded Bob, in a most professional voice. &lsquo;Step this way,
      my dear ma&rsquo;am. Don&rsquo;t be frightened, ma&rsquo;am. We shall be able to set you to
      rights in a very short time, I have no doubt, ma&rsquo;am. Here, my dear ma&rsquo;am.
      Now then!&rsquo; With this, Mr. Bob Sawyer having handed the old lady to a
      chair, shut the door, drew another chair close to her, and waited to hear
      detailed the symptoms of some disorder from which he saw in perspective a
      long train of profits and advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing the old lady did, was to shake her head a great many
      times, and began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nervous,&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer complacently. &lsquo;Camphor-julep and water three
      times a day, and composing draught at night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to begin, Mr. Sawyer,&rsquo; said the old lady. &lsquo;It is so very
      painful and distressing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You need not begin, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Bob Sawyer. &lsquo;I can anticipate
      all you would say. The head is in fault.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be very sorry to think it was the heart,&rsquo; said the old lady,
      with a slight groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not the slightest danger of that, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied Bob Sawyer. &lsquo;The
      stomach is the primary cause.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Sawyer!&rsquo; exclaimed the old lady, starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not the least doubt of it, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; rejoined Bob, looking wondrous wise.
      &lsquo;Medicine, in time, my dear ma&rsquo;am, would have prevented it all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Sawyer,&rsquo; said the old lady, more flurried than before, &lsquo;this conduct
      is either great impertinence to one in my situation, Sir, or it arises
      from your not understanding the object of my visit. If it had been in the
      power of medicine, or any foresight I could have used, to prevent what has
      occurred, I should certainly have done so. I had better see my nephew at
      once,&rsquo; said the old lady, twirling her reticule indignantly, and rising as
      she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop a moment, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I have not understood
      you. What <i>is</i> the matter, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My niece, Mr. Sawyer,&rsquo; said the old lady: &lsquo;your friend&rsquo;s sister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Bob, all impatience; for the old lady, although much
      agitated, spoke with the most tantalising deliberation, as old ladies
      often do. &lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Left my home, Mr. Sawyer, three days ago, on a pretended visit to my
      sister, another aunt of hers, who keeps the large boarding-school, just
      beyond the third mile-stone, where there is a very large laburnum-tree and
      an oak gate,&rsquo; said the old lady, stopping in this place to dry her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, devil take the laburnum-tree, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo; said Bob, quite forgetting his
      professional dignity in his anxiety. &lsquo;Get on a little faster; put a little
      more steam on, ma&rsquo;am, pray.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This morning,&rsquo; said the old lady slowly&mdash;&lsquo;this morning, she&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She came back, ma&rsquo;am, I suppose,&rsquo; said Bob, with great animation. &lsquo;Did
      she come back?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, she did not; she wrote,&rsquo; replied the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did she say?&rsquo; inquired Bob eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She said, Mr. Sawyer,&rsquo; replied the old lady&mdash;&lsquo;and it is this I want
      to prepare Benjamin&rsquo;s mind for, gently and by degrees; she said that she
      was&mdash;I have got the letter in my pocket, Mr. Sawyer, but my glasses
      are in the carriage, and I should only waste your time if I attempted to
      point out the passage to you, without them; she said, in short, Mr.
      Sawyer, that she was married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What!&rsquo; said, or rather shouted, Mr. Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Married,&rsquo; repeated the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bob Sawyer stopped to hear no more; but darting from the surgery into
      the outer shop, cried in a stentorian voice, &lsquo;Ben, my boy, she&rsquo;s bolted!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ben Allen, who had been slumbering behind the counter, with his head
      half a foot or so below his knees, no sooner heard this appalling
      communication, than he made a precipitate rush at Mr. Martin, and,
      twisting his hand in the neck-cloth of that taciturn servitor, expressed
      an obliging intention of choking him where he stood. This intention, with
      a promptitude often the effect of desperation, he at once commenced
      carrying into execution, with much vigour and surgical skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Martin, who was a man of few words and possessed but little power of
      eloquence or persuasion, submitted to this operation with a very calm and
      agreeable expression of countenance, for some seconds; finding, however,
      that it threatened speedily to lead to a result which would place it
      beyond his power to claim any wages, board or otherwise, in all time to
      come, he muttered an inarticulate remonstrance and felled Mr. Benjamin
      Allen to the ground. As that gentleman had his hands entangled in his
      cravat, he had no alternative but to follow him to the floor. There they
      both lay struggling, when the shop door opened, and the party was
      increased by the arrival of two most unexpected visitors, to wit, Mr.
      Pickwick and Mr. Samuel Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impression at once produced on Mr. Weller&rsquo;s mind by what he saw, was,
      that Mr. Martin was hired by the establishment of Sawyer, late Nockemorf,
      to take strong medicine, or to go into fits and be experimentalised upon,
      or to swallow poison now and then with the view of testing the efficacy of
      some new antidotes, or to do something or other to promote the great
      science of medicine, and gratify the ardent spirit of inquiry burning in
      the bosoms of its two young professors. So, without presuming to
      interfere, Sam stood perfectly still, and looked on, as if he were
      mightily interested in the result of the then pending experiment. Not so,
      Mr. Pickwick. He at once threw himself on the astonished combatants, with
      his accustomed energy, and loudly called upon the bystanders to interpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      This roused Mr. Bob Sawyer, who had been hitherto quite paralysed by the
      frenzy of his companion. With that gentleman&rsquo;s assistance, Mr. Pickwick
      raised Ben Allen to his feet. Mr. Martin finding himself alone on the
      floor, got up, and looked about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Allen,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;what is the matter, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind, Sir!&rsquo; replied Mr. Allen, with haughty defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, looking at Bob Sawyer. &lsquo;Is he
      unwell?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Bob could reply, Mr. Ben Allen seized Mr. Pickwick by the hand, and
      murmured, in sorrowful accents, &lsquo;My sister, my dear Sir; my sister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, is that all!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;We shall easily arrange that
      matter, I hope. Your sister is safe and well, and I am here, my dear Sir,
      to&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sorry to do anythin&rsquo; as may cause an interruption to such wery pleasant
      proceedin&rsquo;s, as the king said wen he dissolved the parliament,&rsquo; interposed
      Mr. Weller, who had been peeping through the glass door; &lsquo;but there&rsquo;s
      another experiment here, sir. Here&rsquo;s a wenerable old lady a&mdash;lyin&rsquo; on
      the carpet waitin&rsquo; for dissection, or galwinism, or some other rewivin&rsquo; 
      and scientific inwention.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I forgot,&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Ben Allen. &lsquo;It is my aunt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Poor lady! Gently Sam, gently.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Strange sitivation for one o&rsquo; the family,&rsquo; observed Sam Weller, hoisting
      the aunt into a chair. &lsquo;Now depitty sawbones, bring out the wollatilly!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter observation was addressed to the boy in gray, who, having
      handed over the fly to the care of the street-keeper, had come back to see
      what all the noise was about. Between the boy in gray, and Mr. Bob Sawyer,
      and Mr. Benjamin Allen (who having frightened his aunt into a fainting
      fit, was affectionately solicitous for her recovery) the old lady was at
      length restored to consciousness; then Mr. Ben Allen, turning with a
      puzzled countenance to Mr. Pickwick, asked him what he was about to say,
      when he had been so alarmingly interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are all friends here, I presume?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, clearing his
      voice, and looking towards the man of few words with the surly
      countenance, who drove the fly with the chubby horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reminded Mr. Bob Sawyer that the boy in gray was looking on, with
      eyes wide open, and greedy ears. The incipient chemist having been lifted
      up by his coat collar, and dropped outside the door, Bob Sawyer assured
      Mr. Pickwick that he might speak without reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your sister, my dear Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, turning to Benjamin Allen,
      &lsquo;is in London; well and happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her happiness is no object to me, sir,&rsquo; said Benjamin Allen, with a
      flourish of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her husband <i>is</i> an object to <i>me</i>, Sir,&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer. &lsquo;He
      shall be an object to me, sir, at twelve paces, and a pretty object I&rsquo;ll
      make of him, sir&mdash;a mean-spirited scoundrel!&rsquo; This, as it stood, was
      a very pretty denunciation, and magnanimous withal; but Mr. Bob Sawyer
      rather weakened its effect, by winding up with some general observations
      concerning the punching of heads and knocking out of eyes, which were
      commonplace by comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;before you apply those epithets to the
      gentleman in question, consider, dispassionately, the extent of his fault,
      and above all remember that he is a friend of mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer. &lsquo;His name!&rsquo; cried Ben Allen. &lsquo;His name!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Nathaniel Winkle,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Benjamin Allen deliberately crushed his spectacles beneath the heel of
      his boot, and having picked up the pieces, and put them into three
      separate pockets, folded his arms, bit his lips, and looked in a
      threatening manner at the bland features of Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it&rsquo;s you, is it, Sir, who have encouraged and brought about this
      match?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Benjamin Allen at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it&rsquo;s this gentleman&rsquo;s servant, I suppose,&rsquo; interrupted the old lady,
      &lsquo;who has been skulking about my house, and endeavouring to entrap my
      servants to conspire against their mistress.&mdash;Martin!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said the surly man, coming forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that the young man you saw in the lane, whom you told me about, this
      morning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Martin, who, as it has already appeared, was a man of few words,
      looked at Sam Weller, nodded his head, and growled forth, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the
      man.&rsquo; Mr. Weller, who was never proud, gave a smile of friendly
      recognition as his eyes encountered those of the surly groom, and admitted
      in courteous terms, that he had &lsquo;knowed him afore.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And this is the faithful creature,&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Ben Allen, &lsquo;whom I had
      nearly suffocated!&mdash;Mr. Pickwick, how dare you allow your fellow to
      be employed in the abduction of my sister? I demand that you explain this
      matter, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Explain it, sir!&rsquo; cried Bob Sawyer fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a conspiracy,&rsquo; said Ben Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A regular plant,&rsquo; added Mr. Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A disgraceful imposition,&rsquo; observed the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing but a do,&rsquo; remarked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray hear me,&rsquo; urged Mr. Pickwick, as Mr. Ben Allen fell into a chair
      that patients were bled in, and gave way to his pocket-handkerchief. &lsquo;I
      have rendered no assistance in this matter, beyond being present at one
      interview between the young people which I could not prevent, and from
      which I conceived my presence would remove any slight colouring of
      impropriety that it might otherwise have had; this is the whole share I
      have had in the transaction, and I had no suspicion that an immediate
      marriage was even contemplated. Though, mind,&rsquo; added Mr. Pickwick, hastily
      checking himself&mdash;&lsquo;mind, I do not say I should have prevented it, if
      I had known that it was intended.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You hear that, all of you; you hear that?&rsquo; said Mr. Benjamin Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope they do,&rsquo; mildly observed Mr. Pickwick, looking round, &lsquo;and,&rsquo; 
      added that gentleman, his colour mounting as he spoke, &lsquo;I hope they hear
      this, Sir, also. That from what has been stated to me, sir, I assert that
      you were by no means justified in attempting to force your sister&rsquo;s
      inclinations as you did, and that you should rather have endeavoured by
      your kindness and forbearance to have supplied the place of other nearer
      relations whom she had never known, from a child. As regards my young
      friend, I must beg to add, that in every point of worldly advantage he is,
      at least, on an equal footing with yourself, if not on a much better one,
      and that unless I hear this question discussed with becoming temper and
      moderation, I decline hearing any more said upon the subject.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish to make a wery few remarks in addition to wot has been put for&rsquo;ard
      by the honourable gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n as has jist give over,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller,
      stepping forth, &lsquo;wich is this here: a indiwidual in company has called me
      a feller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That has nothing whatever to do with the matter, Sam,&rsquo; interposed Mr.
      Pickwick. &lsquo;Pray hold your tongue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to say nothin&rsquo; on that &lsquo;ere pint, sir,&rsquo; replied Sam, &lsquo;but
      merely this here. P&rsquo;raps that gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n may think as there wos a priory
      &lsquo;tachment; but there worn&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the sort, for the young lady said
      in the wery beginnin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the keepin&rsquo; company, that she couldn&rsquo;t abide him.
      Nobody&rsquo;s cut him out, and it &lsquo;ud ha&rsquo; been jist the wery same for him if
      the young lady had never seen Mr. Vinkle. That&rsquo;s what I wished to say,
      sir, and I hope I&rsquo;ve now made that &lsquo;ere gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n&rsquo;s mind easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short pause followed these consolatory remarks of Mr. Weller. Then Mr.
      Ben Allen rising from his chair, protested that he would never see
      Arabella&rsquo;s face again; while Mr. Bob Sawyer, despite Sam&rsquo;s flattering
      assurance, vowed dreadful vengeance on the happy bridegroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, just when matters were at their height, and threatening to remain so,
      Mr. Pickwick found a powerful assistant in the old lady, who, evidently
      much struck by the mode in which he had advocated her niece&rsquo;s cause,
      ventured to approach Mr. Benjamin Allen with a few comforting reflections,
      of which the chief were, that after all, perhaps, it was well it was no
      worse; the least said the soonest mended, and upon her word she did not
      know that it was so very bad after all; what was over couldn&rsquo;t be begun,
      and what couldn&rsquo;t be cured must be endured; with various other assurances
      of the like novel and strengthening description. To all of these, Mr.
      Benjamin Allen replied that he meant no disrespect to his aunt, or anybody
      there, but if it were all the same to them, and they would allow him to
      have his own way, he would rather have the pleasure of hating his sister
      till death, and after it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, when this determination had been announced half a hundred
      times, the old lady suddenly bridling up and looking very majestic, wished
      to know what she had done that no respect was to be paid to her years or
      station, and that she should be obliged to beg and pray, in that way, of
      her own nephew, whom she remembered about five-and-twenty years before he
      was born, and whom she had known, personally, when he hadn&rsquo;t a tooth in
      his head; to say nothing of her presence on the first occasion of his
      having his hair cut, and assistance at numerous other times and ceremonies
      during his babyhood, of sufficient importance to found a claim upon his
      affection, obedience, and sympathies, for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the good lady was bestowing this objurgation on Mr. Ben Allen, Bob
      Sawyer and Mr. Pickwick had retired in close conversation to the inner
      room, where Mr. Sawyer was observed to apply himself several times to the
      mouth of a black bottle, under the influence of which, his features
      gradually assumed a cheerful and even jovial expression. And at last he
      emerged from the room, bottle in hand, and, remarking that he was very
      sorry to say he had been making a fool of himself, begged to propose the
      health and happiness of Mr. and Mrs. Winkle, whose felicity, so far from
      envying, he would be the first to congratulate them upon. Hearing this,
      Mr. Ben Allen suddenly arose from his chair, and, seizing the black
      bottle, drank the toast so heartily, that, the liquor being strong, he
      became nearly as black in the face as the bottle. Finally, the black
      bottle went round till it was empty, and there was so much shaking of
      hands and interchanging of compliments, that even the metal-visaged Mr.
      Martin condescended to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer, rubbing his hands, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll have a jolly night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;that I must return to my inn. I have not
      been accustomed to fatigue lately, and my journey has tired me
      exceedingly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll take some tea, Mr. Pickwick?&rsquo; said the old lady, with irresistible
      sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, I would rather not,&rsquo; replied that gentleman. The truth is,
      that the old lady&rsquo;s evidently increasing admiration was Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      principal inducement for going away. He thought of Mrs. Bardell; and every
      glance of the old lady&rsquo;s eyes threw him into a cold perspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Pickwick could by no means be prevailed upon to stay, it was
      arranged at once, on his own proposition, that Mr. Benjamin Allen should
      accompany him on his journey to the elder Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s, and that the coach
      should be at the door, at nine o&rsquo;clock next morning. He then took his
      leave, and, followed by Samuel Weller, repaired to the Bush. It is worthy
      of remark, that Mr. Martin&rsquo;s face was horribly convulsed as he shook hands
      with Sam at parting, and that he gave vent to a smile and an oath
      simultaneously; from which tokens it has been inferred by those who were
      best acquainted with that gentleman&rsquo;s peculiarities, that he expressed
      himself much pleased with Mr. Weller&rsquo;s society, and requested the honour
      of his further acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I order a private room, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Sam, when they reached the
      Bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, no, Sam,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;as I dined in the coffee-room, and
      shall go to bed soon, it is hardly worth while. See who there is in the
      travellers&rsquo; room, Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller departed on his errand, and presently returned to say that
      there was only a gentleman with one eye; and that he and the landlord were
      drinking a bowl of bishop together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will join them,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a queer customer, the vun-eyed vun, sir,&rsquo; observed Mr. Weller, as he
      led the way. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a-gammonin&rsquo; that &lsquo;ere landlord, he is, sir, till he
      don&rsquo;t rightly know wether he&rsquo;s a-standing on the soles of his boots or the
      crown of his hat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The individual to whom this observation referred, was sitting at the upper
      end of the room when Mr. Pickwick entered, and was smoking a large Dutch
      pipe, with his eye intently fixed on the round face of the landlord; a
      jolly-looking old personage, to whom he had recently been relating some
      tale of wonder, as was testified by sundry disjointed exclamations of,
      &lsquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it! The strangest thing I ever heard!
      Couldn&rsquo;t have supposed it possible!&rsquo; and other expressions of astonishment
      which burst spontaneously from his lips, as he returned the fixed gaze of
      the one-eyed man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Servant, sir,&rsquo; said the one-eyed man to Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Fine night, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very much so indeed,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, as the waiter placed a small
      decanter of brandy, and some hot water before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mr. Pickwick was mixing his brandy-and-water, the one-eyed man
      looked round at him earnestly, from time to time, and at length said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ve seen you before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t recollect you,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say not,&rsquo; said the one-eyed man. &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t know me, but I knew
      two friends of yours that were stopping at the Peacock at Eatanswill, at
      the time of the election.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, indeed!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; rejoined the one-eyed man. &lsquo;I mentioned a little circumstance to
      them about a friend of mine of the name of Tom Smart. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve heard
      them speak of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Often,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick, smiling. &lsquo;He was your uncle, I think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; only a friend of my uncle&rsquo;s,&rsquo; replied the one-eyed man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was a wonderful man, that uncle of yours, though,&rsquo; remarked the
      landlord shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I think he was; I think I may say he was,&rsquo; answered the one-eyed
      man. &lsquo;I could tell you a story about that same uncle, gentlemen, that
      would rather surprise you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Could you?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Let us hear it, by all means.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The one-eyed bagman ladled out a glass of negus from the bowl, and drank
      it; smoked a long whiff out of the Dutch pipe; and then, calling to Sam
      Weller who was lingering near the door, that he needn&rsquo;t go away unless he
      wanted to, because the story was no secret, fixed his eye upon the
      landlord&rsquo;s, and proceeded, in the words of the next chapter.

      CHAPTER XLIX. CONTAINING THE STORY OF THE BAGMAN&rsquo;S UNCLE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y uncle,
      gentlemen,&rsquo; said the bagman, &lsquo;was one of the merriest, pleasantest,
      cleverest fellows, that ever lived. I wish you had known him, gentlemen.
      On second thoughts, gentlemen, I don&rsquo;t wish you had known him, for if you
      had, you would have been all, by this time, in the ordinary course of
      nature, if not dead, at all events so near it, as to have taken to
      stopping at home and giving up company, which would have deprived me of
      the inestimable pleasure of addressing you at this moment. Gentlemen, I
      wish your fathers and mothers had known my uncle. They would have been
      amazingly fond of him, especially your respectable mothers; I know they
      would. If any two of his numerous virtues predominated over the many that
      adorned his character, I should say they were his mixed punch and his
      after-supper song. Excuse my dwelling on these melancholy recollections of
      departed worth; you won&rsquo;t see a man like my uncle every day in the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have always considered it a great point in my uncle&rsquo;s character,
      gentlemen, that he was the intimate friend and companion of Tom Smart, of
      the great house of Bilson and Slum, Cateaton Street, City. My uncle
      collected for Tiggin and Welps, but for a long time he went pretty near
      the same journey as Tom; and the very first night they met, my uncle took
      a fancy for Tom, and Tom took a fancy for my uncle. They made a bet of a
      new hat before they had known each other half an hour, who should brew the
      best quart of punch and drink it the quickest. My uncle was judged to have
      won the making, but Tom Smart beat him in the drinking by about half a
      salt-spoonful. They took another quart apiece to drink each other&rsquo;s health
      in, and were staunch friends ever afterwards. There&rsquo;s a destiny in these
      things, gentlemen; we can&rsquo;t help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In personal appearance, my uncle was a trifle shorter than the middle
      size; he was a thought stouter too, than the ordinary run of people, and
      perhaps his face might be a shade redder. He had the jolliest face you
      ever saw, gentleman: something like Punch, with a handsome nose and chin;
      his eyes were always twinkling and sparkling with good-humour; and a smile&mdash;not
      one of your unmeaning wooden grins, but a real, merry, hearty,
      good-tempered smile&mdash;was perpetually on his countenance. He was
      pitched out of his gig once, and knocked, head first, against a milestone.
      There he lay, stunned, and so cut about the face with some gravel which
      had been heaped up alongside it, that, to use my uncle&rsquo;s own strong
      expression, if his mother could have revisited the earth, she wouldn&rsquo;t
      have known him. Indeed, when I come to think of the matter, gentlemen, I
      feel pretty sure she wouldn&rsquo;t, for she died when my uncle was two years
      and seven months old, and I think it&rsquo;s very likely that, even without the
      gravel, his top-boots would have puzzled the good lady not a little; to
      say nothing of his jolly red face. However, there he lay, and I have heard
      my uncle say, many a time, that the man said who picked him up that he was
      smiling as merrily as if he had tumbled out for a treat, and that after
      they had bled him, the first faint glimmerings of returning animation,
      were his jumping up in bed, bursting out into a loud laugh, kissing the
      young woman who held the basin, and demanding a mutton chop and a pickled
      walnut. He was very fond of pickled walnuts, gentlemen. He said he always
      found that, taken without vinegar, they relished the beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My uncle&rsquo;s great journey was in the fall of the leaf, at which time he
      collected debts, and took orders, in the north; going from London to
      Edinburgh, from Edinburgh to Glasgow, from Glasgow back to Edinburgh, and
      thence to London by the smack. You are to understand that his second visit
      to Edinburgh was for his own pleasure. He used to go back for a week, just
      to look up his old friends; and what with breakfasting with this one,
      lunching with that, dining with the third, and supping with another, a
      pretty tight week he used to make of it. I don&rsquo;t know whether any of you,
      gentlemen, ever partook of a real substantial hospitable Scotch breakfast,
      and then went out to a slight lunch of a bushel of oysters, a dozen or so
      of bottled ale, and a noggin or two of whiskey to close up with. If you
      ever did, you will agree with me that it requires a pretty strong head to
      go out to dinner and supper afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But bless your hearts and eyebrows, all this sort of thing was nothing to
      my uncle! He was so well seasoned, that it was mere child&rsquo;s play. I have
      heard him say that he could see the Dundee people out, any day, and walk
      home afterwards without staggering; and yet the Dundee people have as
      strong heads and as strong punch, gentlemen, as you are likely to meet
      with, between the poles. I have heard of a Glasgow man and a Dundee man
      drinking against each other for fifteen hours at a sitting. They were both
      suffocated, as nearly as could be ascertained, at the same moment, but
      with this trifling exception, gentlemen, they were not a bit the worse for
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One night, within four-and-twenty hours of the time when he had settled
      to take shipping for London, my uncle supped at the house of a very old
      friend of his, a Bailie Mac something and four syllables after it, who
      lived in the old town of Edinburgh. There were the bailie&rsquo;s wife, and the
      bailie&rsquo;s three daughters, and the bailie&rsquo;s grown-up son, and three or four
      stout, bushy eye-browed, canny, old Scotch fellows, that the bailie had
      got together to do honour to my uncle, and help to make merry. It was a
      glorious supper. There was kippered salmon, and Finnan haddocks, and a
      lamb&rsquo;s head, and a haggis&mdash;a celebrated Scotch dish, gentlemen, which
      my uncle used to say always looked to him, when it came to table, very
      much like a Cupid&rsquo;s stomach&mdash;and a great many other things besides,
      that I forget the names of, but very good things, notwithstanding. The
      lassies were pretty and agreeable; the bailie&rsquo;s wife was one of the best
      creatures that ever lived; and my uncle was in thoroughly good cue. The
      consequence of which was, that the young ladies tittered and giggled, and
      the old lady laughed out loud, and the bailie and the other old fellows
      roared till they were red in the face, the whole mortal time. I don&rsquo;t
      quite recollect how many tumblers of whiskey-toddy each man drank after
      supper; but this I know, that about one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the
      bailie&rsquo;s grown-up son became insensible while attempting the first verse
      of &ldquo;Willie brewed a peck o&rsquo; maut&rdquo;; and he having been, for half an hour
      before, the only other man visible above the mahogany, it occurred to my
      uncle that it was almost time to think about going, especially as drinking
      had set in at seven o&rsquo;clock, in order that he might get home at a decent
      hour. But, thinking it might not be quite polite to go just then, my uncle
      voted himself into the chair, mixed another glass, rose to propose his own
      health, addressed himself in a neat and complimentary speech, and drank
      the toast with great enthusiasm. Still nobody woke; so my uncle took a
      little drop more&mdash;neat this time, to prevent the toddy from
      disagreeing with him&mdash;and, laying violent hands on his hat, sallied
      forth into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was a wild, gusty night when my uncle closed the bailie&rsquo;s door, and
      settling his hat firmly on his head to prevent the wind from taking it,
      thrust his hands into his pockets, and looking upward, took a short survey
      of the state of the weather. The clouds were drifting over the moon at
      their giddiest speed; at one time wholly obscuring her; at another,
      suffering her to burst forth in full splendour and shed her light on all
      the objects around; anon, driving over her again, with increased velocity,
      and shrouding everything in darkness. &ldquo;Really, this won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said my
      uncle, addressing himself to the weather, as if he felt himself personally
      offended. &ldquo;This is not at all the kind of thing for my voyage. It will not
      do at any price,&rdquo; said my uncle, very impressively. Having repeated this,
      several times, he recovered his balance with some difficulty&mdash;for he
      was rather giddy with looking up into the sky so long&mdash;and walked
      merrily on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The bailie&rsquo;s house was in the Canongate, and my uncle was going to the
      other end of Leith Walk, rather better than a mile&rsquo;s journey. On either
      side of him, there shot up against the dark sky, tall, gaunt, straggling
      houses, with time-stained fronts, and windows that seemed to have shared
      the lot of eyes in mortals, and to have grown dim and sunken with age.
      Six, seven, eight storey high, were the houses; storey piled upon storey,
      as children build with cards&mdash;throwing their dark shadows over the
      roughly paved road, and making the dark night darker. A few oil lamps were
      scattered at long distances, but they only served to mark the dirty
      entrance to some narrow close, or to show where a common stair
      communicated, by steep and intricate windings, with the various flats
      above. Glancing at all these things with the air of a man who had seen
      them too often before, to think them worthy of much notice now, my uncle
      walked up the middle of the street, with a thumb in each waistcoat pocket,
      indulging from time to time in various snatches of song, chanted forth
      with such good-will and spirit, that the quiet honest folk started from
      their first sleep and lay trembling in bed till the sound died away in the
      distance; when, satisfying themselves that it was only some drunken
      ne&rsquo;er-do-weel finding his way home, they covered themselves up warm and
      fell asleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am particular in describing how my uncle walked up the middle of the
      street, with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, gentlemen, because, as
      he often used to say (and with great reason too) there is nothing at all
      extraordinary in this story, unless you distinctly understand at the
      beginning, that he was not by any means of a marvellous or romantic turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen, my uncle walked on with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets,
      taking the middle of the street to himself, and singing, now a verse of a
      love song, and then a verse of a drinking one, and when he was tired of
      both, whistling melodiously, until he reached the North Bridge, which, at
      this point, connects the old and new towns of Edinburgh. Here he stopped
      for a minute, to look at the strange, irregular clusters of lights piled
      one above the other, and twinkling afar off so high, that they looked like
      stars, gleaming from the castle walls on the one side and the Calton Hill
      on the other, as if they illuminated veritable castles in the air; while
      the old picturesque town slept heavily on, in gloom and darkness below:
      its palace and chapel of Holyrood, guarded day and night, as a friend of
      my uncle&rsquo;s used to say, by old Arthur&rsquo;s Seat, towering, surly and dark,
      like some gruff genius, over the ancient city he has watched so long. I
      say, gentlemen, my uncle stopped here, for a minute, to look about him;
      and then, paying a compliment to the weather, which had a little cleared
      up, though the moon was sinking, walked on again, as royally as before;
      keeping the middle of the road with great dignity, and looking as if he
      would very much like to meet with somebody who would dispute possession of
      it with him. There was nobody at all disposed to contest the point, as it
      happened; and so, on he went, with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets,
      like a lamb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When my uncle reached the end of Leith Walk, he had to cross a pretty
      large piece of waste ground which separated him from a short street which
      he had to turn down to go direct to his lodging. Now, in this piece of
      waste ground, there was, at that time, an enclosure belonging to some
      wheelwright who contracted with the Post Office for the purchase of old,
      worn-out mail coaches; and my uncle, being very fond of coaches, old,
      young, or middle-aged, all at once took it into his head to step out of
      his road for no other purpose than to peep between the palings at these
      mails&mdash;about a dozen of which he remembered to have seen, crowded
      together in a very forlorn and dismantled state, inside. My uncle was a
      very enthusiastic, emphatic sort of person, gentlemen; so, finding that he
      could not obtain a good peep between the palings he got over them, and
      sitting himself quietly down on an old axle-tree, began to contemplate the
      mail coaches with a deal of gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There might be a dozen of them, or there might be more&mdash;my uncle was
      never quite certain on this point, and being a man of very scrupulous
      veracity about numbers, didn&rsquo;t like to say&mdash;but there they stood, all
      huddled together in the most desolate condition imaginable. The doors had
      been torn from their hinges and removed; the linings had been stripped
      off, only a shred hanging here and there by a rusty nail; the lamps were
      gone, the poles had long since vanished, the ironwork was rusty, the paint
      was worn away; the wind whistled through the chinks in the bare woodwork;
      and the rain, which had collected on the roofs, fell, drop by drop, into
      the insides with a hollow and melancholy sound. They were the decaying
      skeletons of departed mails, and in that lonely place, at that time of
      night, they looked chill and dismal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My uncle rested his head upon his hands, and thought of the busy,
      bustling people who had rattled about, years before, in the old coaches,
      and were now as silent and changed; he thought of the numbers of people to
      whom one of these crazy, mouldering vehicles had borne, night after night,
      for many years, and through all weathers, the anxiously expected
      intelligence, the eagerly looked-for remittance, the promised assurance of
      health and safety, the sudden announcement of sickness and death. The
      merchant, the lover, the wife, the widow, the mother, the school-boy, the
      very child who tottered to the door at the postman&rsquo;s knock&mdash;how had
      they all looked forward to the arrival of the old coach. And where were
      they all now?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen, my uncle used to <i>say </i>that he thought all this at the
      time, but I rather suspect he learned it out of some book afterwards, for
      he distinctly stated that he fell into a kind of doze, as he sat on the
      old axle-tree looking at the decayed mail coaches, and that he was
      suddenly awakened by some deep church bell striking two. Now, my uncle was
      never a fast thinker, and if he had thought all these things, I am quite
      certain it would have taken him till full half-past two o&rsquo;clock at the
      very least. I am, therefore, decidedly of opinion, gentlemen, that my
      uncle fell into a kind of doze, without having thought about anything at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be this as it may, a church bell struck two. My uncle woke, rubbed his
      eyes, and jumped up in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In one instant, after the clock struck two, the whole of this deserted
      and quiet spot had become a scene of most extraordinary life and
      animation. The mail coach doors were on their hinges, the lining was
      replaced, the ironwork was as good as new, the paint was restored, the
      lamps were alight; cushions and greatcoats were on every coach-box,
      porters were thrusting parcels into every boot, guards were stowing away
      letter-bags, hostlers were dashing pails of water against the renovated
      wheels; numbers of men were pushing about, fixing poles into every coach;
      passengers arrived, portmanteaus were handed up, horses were put to; in
      short, it was perfectly clear that every mail there, was to be off
      directly. Gentlemen, my uncle opened his eyes so wide at all this, that,
      to the very last moment of his life, he used to wonder how it fell out
      that he had ever been able to shut &lsquo;em again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Now then!&rdquo; said a voice, as my uncle felt a hand on his shoulder,
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;re booked for one inside. You&rsquo;d better get in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I booked!&rdquo; said my uncle, turning round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My uncle, gentlemen, could say nothing, he was so very much astonished.
      The queerest thing of all was that although there was such a crowd of
      persons, and although fresh faces were pouring in, every moment, there was
      no telling where they came from. They seemed to start up, in some strange
      manner, from the ground, or the air, and disappear in the same way. When a
      porter had put his luggage in the coach, and received his fare, he turned
      round and was gone; and before my uncle had well begun to wonder what had
      become of him, half a dozen fresh ones started up, and staggered along
      under the weight of parcels, which seemed big enough to crush them. The
      passengers were all dressed so oddly too! Large, broad-skirted laced
      coats, with great cuffs and no collars; and wigs, gentlemen&mdash;great
      formal wigs with a tie behind. My uncle could make nothing of it.
    </p>

      <a href="images/20384.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Now, are you going to get in?&rdquo; said the person who had addressed my
      uncle before. He was dressed as a mail guard, with a wig on his head and
      most enormous cuffs to his coat, and had a lantern in one hand, and a huge
      blunderbuss in the other, which he was going to stow away in his little
      arm-chest. &ldquo;<i>are </i>you going to get in, Jack Martin?&rdquo; said the guard,
      holding the lantern to my uncle&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Hollo!&rdquo; said my uncle, falling back a step or two. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s familiar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so on the way-bill,&rdquo; said the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a &lsquo;Mister&rsquo; before it?&rdquo; said my uncle. For he felt,
      gentlemen, that for a guard he didn&rsquo;t know, to call him Jack Martin, was a
      liberty which the Post Office wouldn&rsquo;t have sanctioned if they had known
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;No, there is not,&rdquo; rejoined the guard coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Is the fare paid?&rdquo; inquired my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; rejoined the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;It is, is it?&rdquo; said my uncle. &ldquo;Then here goes! Which coach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the guard, pointing to an old-fashioned Edinburgh and London
      mail, which had the steps down and the door open. &ldquo;Stop! Here are the
      other passengers. Let them get in first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As the guard spoke, there all at once appeared, right in front of my
      uncle, a young gentleman in a powdered wig, and a sky-blue coat trimmed
      with silver, made very full and broad in the skirts, which were lined with
      buckram. Tiggin and Welps were in the printed calico and waistcoat piece
      line, gentlemen, so my uncle knew all the materials at once. He wore knee
      breeches, and a kind of leggings rolled up over his silk stockings, and
      shoes with buckles; he had ruffles at his wrists, a three-cornered hat on
      his head, and a long taper sword by his side. The flaps of his waist-coat
      came half-way down his thighs, and the ends of his cravat reached to his
      waist. He stalked gravely to the coach door, pulled off his hat, and held
      it above his head at arm&rsquo;s length, cocking his little finger in the air at
      the same time, as some affected people do, when they take a cup of tea.
      Then he drew his feet together, and made a low, grave bow, and then put
      out his left hand. My uncle was just going to step forward, and shake it
      heartily, when he perceived that these attentions were directed, not
      towards him, but to a young lady who just then appeared at the foot of the
      steps, attired in an old-fashioned green velvet dress with a long waist
      and stomacher. She had no bonnet on her head, gentlemen, which was muffled
      in a black silk hood, but she looked round for an instant as she prepared
      to get into the coach, and such a beautiful face as she disclosed, my
      uncle had never seen&mdash;not even in a picture. She got into the coach,
      holding up her dress with one hand; and as my uncle always said with a
      round oath, when he told the story, he wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it possible
      that legs and feet could have been brought to such a state of perfection
      unless he had seen them with his own eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, in this one glimpse of the beautiful face, my uncle saw that the
      young lady cast an imploring look upon him, and that she appeared
      terrified and distressed. He noticed, too, that the young fellow in the
      powdered wig, notwithstanding his show of gallantry, which was all very
      fine and grand, clasped her tight by the wrist when she got in, and
      followed himself immediately afterwards. An uncommonly ill-looking fellow,
      in a close brown wig, and a plum-coloured suit, wearing a very large
      sword, and boots up to his hips, belonged to the party; and when he sat
      himself down next to the young lady, who shrank into a corner at his
      approach, my uncle was confirmed in his original impression that something
      dark and mysterious was going forward, or, as he always said himself, that
      &ldquo;there was a screw loose somewhere.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s quite surprising how quickly he
      made up his mind to help the lady at any peril, if she needed any help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Death and lightning!&rdquo; exclaimed the young gentleman, laying his hand
      upon his sword as my uncle entered the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Blood and thunder!&rdquo; roared the other gentleman. With this, he whipped
      his sword out, and made a lunge at my uncle without further ceremony. My
      uncle had no weapon about him, but with great dexterity he snatched the
      ill-looking gentleman&rsquo;s three-cornered hat from his head, and, receiving
      the point of his sword right through the crown, squeezed the sides
      together, and held it tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Pink him behind!&rdquo; cried the ill-looking gentleman to his companion, as
      he struggled to regain his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;He had better not,&rdquo; cried my uncle, displaying the heel of one of his
      shoes, in a threatening manner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kick his brains out, if he has any&mdash;,
      or fracture his skull if he hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Exerting all his strength, at this
      moment, my uncle wrenched the ill-looking man&rsquo;s sword from his grasp, and
      flung it clean out of the coach window, upon which the younger gentleman
      vociferated, &ldquo;Death and lightning!&rdquo; again, and laid his hand upon the hilt
      of his sword, in a very fierce manner, but didn&rsquo;t draw it. Perhaps,
      gentlemen, as my uncle used to say with a smile, perhaps he was afraid of
      alarming the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Now, gentlemen,&rdquo; said my uncle, taking his seat deliberately, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      want to have any death, with or without lightning, in a lady&rsquo;s presence,
      and we have had quite blood and thundering enough for one journey; so, if
      you please, we&rsquo;ll sit in our places like quiet insides. Here, guard, pick
      up that gentleman&rsquo;s carving-knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As quickly as my uncle said the words, the guard appeared at the coach
      window, with the gentleman&rsquo;s sword in his hand. He held up his lantern,
      and looked earnestly in my uncle&rsquo;s face, as he handed it in, when, by its
      light, my uncle saw, to his great surprise, that an immense crowd of
      mail-coach guards swarmed round the window, every one of whom had his eyes
      earnestly fixed upon him too. He had never seen such a sea of white faces,
      red bodies, and earnest eyes, in all his born days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;This is the strangest sort of thing I ever had anything to do with,&rdquo;
       thought my uncle; &ldquo;allow me to return you your hat, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The ill-looking gentleman received his three-cornered hat in silence,
      looked at the hole in the middle with an inquiring air, and finally stuck
      it on the top of his wig with a solemnity the effect of which was a trifle
      impaired by his sneezing violently at the moment, and jerking it off
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; cried the guard with the lantern, mounting into his little
      seat behind. Away they went. My uncle peeped out of the coach window as
      they emerged from the yard, and observed that the other mails, with
      coachmen, guards, horses, and passengers, complete, were driving round and
      round in circles, at a slow trot of about five miles an hour. My uncle
      burned with indignation, gentlemen. As a commercial man, he felt that the
      mail-bags were not to be trifled with, and he resolved to memorialise the
      Post Office on the subject, the very instant he reached London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At present, however, his thoughts were occupied with the young lady who
      sat in the farthest corner of the coach, with her face muffled closely in
      her hood; the gentleman with the sky-blue coat sitting opposite to her;
      the other man in the plum-coloured suit, by her side; and both watching
      her intently. If she so much as rustled the folds of her hood, he could
      hear the ill-looking man clap his hand upon his sword, and could tell by
      the other&rsquo;s breathing (it was so dark he couldn&rsquo;t see his face) that he
      was looking as big as if he were going to devour her at a mouthful. This
      roused my uncle more and more, and he resolved, come what might, to see
      the end of it. He had a great admiration for bright eyes, and sweet faces,
      and pretty legs and feet; in short, he was fond of the whole sex. It runs
      in our family, gentleman&mdash;so am I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Many were the devices which my uncle practised, to attract the lady&rsquo;s
      attention, or at all events, to engage the mysterious gentlemen in
      conversation. They were all in vain; the gentlemen wouldn&rsquo;t talk, and the
      lady didn&rsquo;t dare. He thrust his head out of the coach window at intervals,
      and bawled out to know why they didn&rsquo;t go faster. But he called till he
      was hoarse; nobody paid the least attention to him. He leaned back in the
      coach, and thought of the beautiful face, and the feet and legs. This
      answered better; it whiled away the time, and kept him from wondering
      where he was going, and how it was that he found himself in such an odd
      situation. Not that this would have worried him much, anyway&mdash;he was
      a mighty free and easy, roving, devil-may-care sort of person, was my
      uncle, gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All of a sudden the coach stopped. &ldquo;Hollo!&rdquo; said my uncle, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s in the
      wind now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Alight here,&rdquo; said the guard, letting down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; cried my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; rejoined the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; said my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Very well, then stop where you are,&rdquo; said the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The passengers had regarded this colloquy with great attention, and,
      finding that my uncle was determined not to alight, the younger man
      squeezed past him, to hand the lady out. At this moment, the ill-looking
      man was inspecting the hole in the crown of his three-cornered hat. As the
      young lady brushed past, she dropped one of her gloves into my uncle&rsquo;s
      hand, and softly whispered, with her lips so close to his face that he
      felt her warm breath on his nose, the single word &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; Gentlemen, my
      uncle leaped out of the coach at once, with such violence that it rocked
      on the springs again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh! you&rsquo;ve thought better of it, have you?&rdquo; said the guard, when he saw
      my uncle standing on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My uncle looked at the guard for a few seconds, in some doubt whether it
      wouldn&rsquo;t be better to wrench his blunderbuss from him, fire it in the face
      of the man with the big sword, knock the rest of the company over the head
      with the stock, snatch up the young lady, and go off in the smoke. On
      second thoughts, however, he abandoned this plan, as being a shade too
      melodramatic in the execution, and followed the two mysterious men, who,
      keeping the lady between them, were now entering an old house in front of
      which the coach had stopped. They turned into the passage, and my uncle
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of all the ruinous and desolate places my uncle had ever beheld, this was
      the most so. It looked as if it had once been a large house of
      entertainment; but the roof had fallen in, in many places, and the stairs
      were steep, rugged, and broken. There was a huge fireplace in the room
      into which they walked, and the chimney was blackened with smoke; but no
      warm blaze lighted it up now. The white feathery dust of burned wood was
      still strewed over the hearth, but the stove was cold, and all was dark
      and gloomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said my uncle, as he looked about him, &ldquo;a mail travelling at the
      rate of six miles and a half an hour, and stopping for an indefinite time
      at such a hole as this, is rather an irregular sort of proceeding, I
      fancy. This shall be made known. I&rsquo;ll write to the papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My uncle said this in a pretty loud voice, and in an open, unreserved
      sort of manner, with the view of engaging the two strangers in
      conversation if he could. But, neither of them took any more notice of him
      than whispering to each other, and scowling at him as they did so. The
      lady was at the farther end of the room, and once she ventured to wave her
      hand, as if beseeching my uncle&rsquo;s assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At length the two strangers advanced a little, and the conversation began
      in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know this is a private room, I suppose, fellow?&rdquo; said the
      gentleman in sky-blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;No, I do not, fellow,&rdquo; rejoined my uncle. &ldquo;Only, if this is a private
      room specially ordered for the occasion, I should think the public room
      must be a <i>very </i>comfortable one;&rdquo; with this, my uncle sat himself
      down in a high-backed chair, and took such an accurate measure of the
      gentleman, with his eyes, that Tiggin and Welps could have supplied him
      with printed calico for a suit, and not an inch too much or too little,
      from that estimate alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Quit this room,&rdquo; said both men together, grasping their swords.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said my uncle, not at all appearing to comprehend their meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Quit the room, or you are a dead man,&rdquo; said the ill-looking fellow with
      the large sword, drawing it at the same time and flourishing it in the
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Down with him!&rdquo; cried the gentleman in sky-blue, drawing his sword also,
      and falling back two or three yards. &ldquo;Down with him!&rdquo; The lady gave a loud
      scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, my uncle was always remarkable for great boldness, and great
      presence of mind. All the time that he had appeared so indifferent to what
      was going on, he had been looking slily about for some missile or weapon
      of defence, and at the very instant when the swords were drawn, he espied,
      standing in the chimney-corner, an old basket-hilted rapier in a rusty
      scabbard. At one bound, my uncle caught it in his hand, drew it,
      flourished it gallantly above his head, called aloud to the lady to keep
      out of the way, hurled the chair at the man in sky-blue, and the scabbard
      at the man in plum-colour, and taking advantage of the confusion, fell
      upon them both, pell-mell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen, there is an old story&mdash;none the worse for being true&mdash;regarding
      a fine young Irish gentleman, who being asked if he could play the fiddle,
      replied he had no doubt he could, but he couldn&rsquo;t exactly say, for
      certain, because he had never tried. This is not inapplicable to my uncle
      and his fencing. He had never had a sword in his hand before, except once
      when he played Richard the Third at a private theatre, upon which occasion
      it was arranged with Richmond that he was to be run through, from behind,
      without showing fight at all. But here he was, cutting and slashing with
      two experienced swordsman, thrusting, and guarding, and poking, and
      slicing, and acquitting himself in the most manful and dexterous manner
      possible, although up to that time he had never been aware that he had the
      least notion of the science. It only shows how true the old saying is,
      that a man never knows what he can do till he tries, gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The noise of the combat was terrific; each of the three combatants
      swearing like troopers, and their swords clashing with as much noise as if
      all the knives and steels in Newport market were rattling together, at the
      same time. When it was at its very height, the lady (to encourage my uncle
      most probably) withdrew her hood entirely from her face, and disclosed a
      countenance of such dazzling beauty, that he would have fought against
      fifty men, to win one smile from it and die. He had done wonders before,
      but now he began to powder away like a raving mad giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At this very moment, the gentleman in sky-blue turning round, and seeing
      the young lady with her face uncovered, vented an exclamation of rage and
      jealousy, and, turning his weapon against her beautiful bosom, pointed a
      thrust at her heart, which caused my uncle to utter a cry of apprehension
      that made the building ring. The lady stepped lightly aside, and snatching
      the young man&rsquo;s sword from his hand, before he had recovered his balance,
      drove him to the wall, and running it through him, and the panelling, up
      to the very hilt, pinned him there, hard and fast. It was a splendid
      example. My uncle, with a loud shout of triumph, and a strength that was
      irresistible, made his adversary retreat in the same direction, and
      plunging the old rapier into the very centre of a large red flower in the
      pattern of his waistcoat, nailed him beside his friend; there they both
      stood, gentlemen, jerking their arms and legs about in agony, like the
      toy-shop figures that are moved by a piece of pack-thread. My uncle always
      said, afterwards, that this was one of the surest means he knew of, for
      disposing of an enemy; but it was liable to one objection on the ground of
      expense, inasmuch as it involved the loss of a sword for every man
      disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;The mail, the mail!&rdquo; cried the lady, running up to my uncle and throwing
      her beautiful arms round his neck; &ldquo;we may yet escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;May!&rdquo; cried my uncle; &ldquo;why, my dear, there&rsquo;s nobody else to kill, is
      there?&rdquo; My uncle was rather disappointed, gentlemen, for he thought a
      little quiet bit of love-making would be agreeable after the slaughtering,
      if it were only to change the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;We have not an instant to lose here,&rdquo; said the young lady. &ldquo;He (pointing
      to the young gentleman in sky-blue) is the only son of the powerful
      Marquess of Filletoville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Well then, my dear, I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll never come to the title,&rdquo; said my
      uncle, looking coolly at the young gentleman as he stood fixed up against
      the wall, in the cockchafer fashion that I have described. &ldquo;You have cut
      off the entail, my love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I have been torn from my home and my friends by these villains,&rdquo; said
      the young lady, her features glowing with indignation. &ldquo;That wretch would
      have married me by violence in another hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Confound his impudence!&rdquo; said my uncle, bestowing a very contemptuous
      look on the dying heir of Filletoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;As you may guess from what you have seen,&rdquo; said the young lady, &ldquo;the
      party were prepared to murder me if I appealed to any one for assistance.
      If their accomplices find us here, we are lost. Two minutes hence may be
      too late. The mail!&rdquo; With these words, overpowered by her feelings, and
      the exertion of sticking the young Marquess of Filletoville, she sank into
      my uncle&rsquo;s arms. My uncle caught her up, and bore her to the house door.
      There stood the mail, with four long-tailed, flowing-maned, black horses,
      ready harnessed; but no coachman, no guard, no hostler even, at the
      horses&rsquo; heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen, I hope I do no injustice to my uncle&rsquo;s memory, when I express
      my opinion, that although he was a bachelor, he had held some ladies in
      his arms before this time; I believe, indeed, that he had rather a habit
      of kissing barmaids; and I know, that in one or two instances, he had been
      seen by credible witnesses, to hug a landlady in a very perceptible
      manner. I mention the circumstance, to show what a very uncommon sort of
      person this beautiful young lady must have been, to have affected my uncle
      in the way she did; he used to say, that as her long dark hair trailed
      over his arm, and her beautiful dark eyes fixed themselves upon his face
      when she recovered, he felt so strange and nervous that his legs trembled
      beneath him. But who can look in a sweet, soft pair of dark eyes, without
      feeling queer? I can&rsquo;t, gentlemen. I am afraid to look at some eyes I
      know, and that&rsquo;s the truth of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You will never leave me,&rdquo; murmured the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said my uncle. And he meant it too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;My dear preserver!&rdquo; exclaimed the young lady. &ldquo;My dear, kind, brave
      preserver!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said my uncle, interrupting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;&lsquo;Why?&rdquo; inquired the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Because your mouth looks so beautiful when you speak,&rdquo; rejoined my
      uncle, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m afraid I shall be rude enough to kiss it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The young lady put up her hand as if to caution my uncle not to do so,
      and said&mdash;No, she didn&rsquo;t say anything&mdash;she smiled. When you are
      looking at a pair of the most delicious lips in the world, and see them
      gently break into a roguish smile&mdash;if you are very near them, and
      nobody else by&mdash;you cannot better testify your admiration of their
      beautiful form and colour than by kissing them at once. My uncle did so,
      and I honour him for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; cried the young lady, starting. &ldquo;The noise of wheels, and
      horses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said my uncle, listening. He had a good ear for wheels, and
      the trampling of hoofs; but there appeared to be so many horses and
      carriages rattling towards them, from a distance, that it was impossible
      to form a guess at their number. The sound was like that of fifty brakes,
      with six blood cattle in each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;We are pursued!&rdquo; cried the young lady, clasping her hands. &ldquo;We are
      pursued. I have no hope but in you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was such an expression of terror in her beautiful face, that my
      uncle made up his mind at once. He lifted her into the coach, told her not
      to be frightened, pressed his lips to hers once more, and then advising
      her to draw up the window to keep the cold air out, mounted to the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Stay, love,&rdquo; cried the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said my uncle, from the coach-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I want to speak to you,&rdquo; said the young lady; &ldquo;only a word. Only one
      word, dearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Must I get down?&rdquo; inquired my uncle. The lady made no answer, but she
      smiled again. Such a smile, gentlemen! It beat the other one, all to
      nothing. My uncle descended from his perch in a twinkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What is it, my dear?&rdquo; said my uncle, looking in at the coach window. The
      lady happened to bend forward at the same time, and my uncle thought she
      looked more beautiful than she had done yet. He was very close to her just
      then, gentlemen, so he really ought to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What is it, my dear?&rdquo; said my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Will you never love any one but me&mdash;never marry any one beside?&rdquo;
       said the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My uncle swore a great oath that he never would marry anybody else, and
      the young lady drew in her head, and pulled up the window. He jumped upon
      the box, squared his elbows, adjusted the ribands, seized the whip which
      lay on the roof, gave one flick to the off leader, and away went the four
      long-tailed, flowing-maned black horses, at fifteen good English miles an
      hour, with the old mail-coach behind them. Whew! How they tore along!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The noise behind grew louder. The faster the old mail went, the faster
      came the pursuers&mdash;men, horses, dogs, were leagued in the pursuit.
      The noise was frightful, but, above all, rose the voice of the young lady,
      urging my uncle on, and shrieking, &ldquo;Faster! Faster!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They whirled past the dark trees, as feathers would be swept before a
      hurricane. Houses, gates, churches, haystacks, objects of every kind they
      shot by, with a velocity and noise like roaring waters suddenly let loose.
      But still the noise of pursuit grew louder, and still my uncle could hear
      the young lady wildly screaming, &ldquo;Faster! Faster!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My uncle plied whip and rein, and the horses flew onward till they were
      white with foam; and yet the noise behind increased; and yet the young
      lady cried, &ldquo;Faster! Faster!&rdquo; My uncle gave a loud stamp on the boot in
      the energy of the moment, and&mdash;found that it was gray morning, and he
      was sitting in the wheelwright&rsquo;s yard, on the box of an old Edinburgh
      mail, shivering with the cold and wet and stamping his feet to warm them!
      He got down, and looked eagerly inside for the beautiful young lady. Alas!
      There was neither door nor seat to the coach. It was a mere shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, my uncle knew very well that there was some mystery in the
      matter, and that everything had passed exactly as he used to relate it. He
      remained staunch to the great oath he had sworn to the beautiful young
      lady, refusing several eligible landladies on her account, and dying a
      bachelor at last. He always said what a curious thing it was that he
      should have found out, by such a mere accident as his clambering over the
      palings, that the ghosts of mail-coaches and horses, guards, coachmen, and
      passengers, were in the habit of making journeys regularly every night. He
      used to add, that he believed he was the only living person who had ever
      been taken as a passenger on one of these excursions. And I think he was
      right, gentlemen&mdash;at least I never heard of any other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder what these ghosts of mail-coaches carry in their bags,&rsquo; said the
      landlord, who had listened to the whole story with profound attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The dead letters, of course,&rsquo; said the bagman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, ah! To be sure,&rsquo; rejoined the landlord. &lsquo;I never thought of that.&rsquo;

      CHAPTER L. HOW MR. PICKWICK SPED UPON HIS MISSION, AND HOW HE WAS
      REINFORCED IN THE OUTSET BY A MOST UNEXPECTED AUXILIARY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he horses were put
      to, punctually at a quarter before nine next morning, and Mr. Pickwick and
      Sam Weller having each taken his seat, the one inside and the other out,
      the postillion was duly directed to repair in the first instance to Mr.
      Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s house, for the purpose of taking up Mr. Benjamin Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with feelings of no small astonishment, when the carriage drew up
      before the door with the red lamp, and the very legible inscription of
      &lsquo;Sawyer, late Nockemorf,&rsquo; that Mr. Pickwick saw, on popping his head out
      of the coach window, the boy in the gray livery very busily employed in
      putting up the shutters&mdash;the which, being an unusual and an
      unbusinesslike proceeding at that hour of the morning, at once suggested
      to his mind two inferences: the one, that some good friend and patient of
      Mr. Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s was dead; the other, that Mr. Bob Sawyer himself was
      bankrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick to the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing&rsquo;s the matter, Sir,&rsquo; replied the boy, expanding his mouth to the
      whole breadth of his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, all right!&rsquo; cried Bob Sawyer, suddenly appearing at the door,
      with a small leathern knapsack, limp and dirty, in one hand, and a rough
      coat and shawl thrown over the other arm. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going, old fellow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Bob Sawyer, &lsquo;and a regular expedition we&rsquo;ll make of it.
      Here, Sam! Look out!&rsquo; Thus briefly bespeaking Mr. Weller&rsquo;s attention, Mr.
      Bob Sawyer jerked the leathern knapsack into the dickey, where it was
      immediately stowed away, under the seat, by Sam, who regarded the
      proceeding with great admiration. This done, Mr. Bob Sawyer, with the
      assistance of the boy, forcibly worked himself into the rough coat, which
      was a few sizes too small for him, and then advancing to the coach window,
      thrust in his head, and laughed boisterously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a start it is, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; cried Bob, wiping the tears out of his
      eyes, with one of the cuffs of the rough coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with some embarrassment, &lsquo;I had no idea
      of your accompanying us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, that&rsquo;s just the very thing,&rsquo; replied Bob, seizing Mr. Pickwick by the
      lappel of his coat. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the joke.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the joke, is it?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; replied Bob. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the whole point of the thing, you know&mdash;that,
      and leaving the business to take care of itself, as it seems to have made
      up its mind not to take care of me.&rsquo; With this explanation of the
      phenomenon of the shutters, Mr. Bob Sawyer pointed to the shop, and
      relapsed into an ecstasy of mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless me, you are surely not mad enough to think of leaving your patients
      without anybody to attend them!&rsquo; remonstrated Mr. Pickwick in a very
      serious tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; asked Bob, in reply. &lsquo;I shall save by it, you know. None of
      them ever pay. Besides,&rsquo; said Bob, lowering his voice to a confidential
      whisper, &lsquo;they will be all the better for it; for, being nearly out of
      drugs, and not able to increase my account just now, I should have been
      obliged to give them calomel all round, and it would have been certain to
      have disagreed with some of them. So it&rsquo;s all for the best.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a philosophy and a strength of reasoning about this reply, which
      Mr. Pickwick was not prepared for. He paused a few moments, and added,
      less firmly than before&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But this chaise, my young friend, will only hold two; and I am pledged to
      Mr. Allen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t think of me for a minute,&rsquo; replied Bob. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve arranged it all; Sam
      and I will share the dickey between us. Look here. This little bill is to
      be wafered on the shop door: &ldquo;Sawyer, late Nockemorf. Inquire of Mrs.
      Cripps over the way.&rdquo; Mrs. Cripps is my boy&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;Mr. Sawyer&rsquo;s very
      sorry,&rdquo; says Mrs. Cripps, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;fetched away early this
      morning to a consultation of the very first surgeons in the country&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t
      do without him&mdash;would have him at any price&mdash;tremendous
      operation.&rdquo; The fact is,&rsquo; said Bob, in conclusion, &lsquo;it&rsquo;ll do me more good
      than otherwise, I expect. If it gets into one of the local papers, it will
      be the making of me. Here&rsquo;s Ben; now then, jump in!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these hurried words, Mr. Bob Sawyer pushed the postboy on one side,
      jerked his friend into the vehicle, slammed the door, put up the steps,
      wafered the bill on the street door, locked it, put the key in his pocket,
      jumped into the dickey, gave the word for starting, and did the whole with
      such extraordinary precipitation, that before Mr. Pickwick had well begun
      to consider whether Mr. Bob Sawyer ought to go or not, they were rolling
      away, with Mr. Bob Sawyer thoroughly established as part and parcel of the
      equipage.
    </p>
    <p>
      So long as their progress was confined to the streets of Bristol, the
      facetious Bob kept his professional green spectacles on, and conducted
      himself with becoming steadiness and gravity of demeanour; merely giving
      utterance to divers verbal witticisms for the exclusive behoof and
      entertainment of Mr. Samuel Weller. But when they emerged on the open
      road, he threw off his green spectacles and his gravity together, and
      performed a great variety of practical jokes, which were calculated to
      attract the attention of the passersby, and to render the carriage and
      those it contained objects of more than ordinary curiosity; the least
      conspicuous among these feats being a most vociferous imitation of a
      key-bugle, and the ostentatious display of a crimson silk
      pocket-handkerchief attached to a walking-stick, which was occasionally
      waved in the air with various gestures indicative of supremacy and
      defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, stopping in the midst of a most sedate
      conversation with Ben Allen, bearing reference to the numerous good
      qualities of Mr. Winkle and his sister&mdash;&lsquo;I wonder what all the people
      we pass, can see in us to make them stare so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a neat turn-out,&rsquo; replied Ben Allen, with something of pride in his
      tone. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re not used to see this sort of thing, every day, I dare say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Possibly,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;It may be so. Perhaps it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick might very probably have reasoned himself into the belief
      that it really was, had he not, just then happening to look out of the
      coach window, observed that the looks of the passengers betokened anything
      but respectful astonishment, and that various telegraphic communications
      appeared to be passing between them and some persons outside the vehicle,
      whereupon it occurred to him that these demonstrations might be, in some
      remote degree, referable to the humorous deportment of Mr. Robert Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;that our volatile friend is committing no
      absurdities in that dickey behind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear, no,&rsquo; replied Ben Allen. &lsquo;Except when he&rsquo;s elevated, Bob&rsquo;s the
      quietest creature breathing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a prolonged imitation of a key-bugle broke upon the ear, succeeded by
      cheers and screams, all of which evidently proceeded from the throat and
      lungs of the quietest creature breathing, or in plainer designation, of
      Mr. Bob Sawyer himself.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Ben Allen looked expressively at each other, and the
      former gentleman taking off his hat, and leaning out of the coach window
      until nearly the whole of his waistcoat was outside it, was at length
      enabled to catch a glimpse of his facetious friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bob Sawyer was seated, not in the dickey, but on the roof of the
      chaise, with his legs as far asunder as they would conveniently go,
      wearing Mr. Samuel Weller&rsquo;s hat on one side of his head, and bearing, in
      one hand, a most enormous sandwich, while, in the other, he supported a
      goodly-sized case-bottle, to both of which he applied himself with intense
      relish, varying the monotony of the occupation by an occasional howl, or
      the interchange of some lively badinage with any passing stranger. The
      crimson flag was carefully tied in an erect position to the rail of the
      dickey; and Mr. Samuel Weller, decorated with Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s hat, was seated
      in the centre thereof, discussing a twin sandwich, with an animated
      countenance, the expression of which betokened his entire and perfect
      approval of the whole arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was enough to irritate a gentleman with Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s sense of
      propriety, but it was not the whole extent of the aggravation, for a
      stage-coach full, inside and out, was meeting them at the moment, and the
      astonishment of the passengers was very palpably evinced. The
      congratulations of an Irish family, too, who were keeping up with the
      chaise, and begging all the time, were of rather a boisterous description,
      especially those of its male head, who appeared to consider the display as
      part and parcel of some political or other procession of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Sawyer!&rsquo; cried Mr. Pickwick, in a state of great excitement, &lsquo;Mr.
      Sawyer, Sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo!&rsquo; responded that gentleman, looking over the side of the chaise
      with all the coolness in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you mad, sir?&rsquo; demanded Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit of it,&rsquo; replied Bob; &lsquo;only cheerful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cheerful, sir!&rsquo; ejaculated Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Take down that scandalous red
      handkerchief, I beg. I insist, Sir. Sam, take it down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Sam could interpose, Mr. Bob Sawyer gracefully struck his colours,
      and having put them in his pocket, nodded in a courteous manner to Mr.
      Pickwick, wiped the mouth of the case-bottle, and applied it to his own,
      thereby informing him, without any unnecessary waste of words, that he
      devoted that draught to wishing him all manner of happiness and
      prosperity. Having done this, Bob replaced the cork with great care, and
      looking benignantly down on Mr. Pickwick, took a large bite out of the
      sandwich, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, whose momentary anger was not quite proof
      against Bob&rsquo;s immovable self-possession, &lsquo;pray let us have no more of this
      absurdity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; replied Bob, once more exchanging hats with Mr. Weller; &lsquo;I
      didn&rsquo;t mean to do it, only I got so enlivened with the ride that I
      couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think of the look of the thing,&rsquo; expostulated Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;have some
      regard to appearances.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, certainly,&rsquo; said Bob, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s not the sort of thing at all. All over,
      governor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied with this assurance, Mr. Pickwick once more drew his head into
      the chaise and pulled up the glass; but he had scarcely resumed the
      conversation which Mr. Bob Sawyer had interrupted, when he was somewhat
      startled by the apparition of a small dark body, of an oblong form, on the
      outside of the window, which gave sundry taps against it, as if impatient
      of admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It looks like a case-bottle;&rsquo; remarked Ben Allen, eyeing the object in
      question through his spectacles with some interest; &lsquo;I rather think it
      belongs to Bob.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The impression was perfectly accurate; for Mr. Bob Sawyer, having attached
      the case-bottle to the end of the walking-stick, was battering the window
      with it, in token of his wish, that his friends inside would partake of
      its contents, in all good-fellowship and harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking at the bottle. &lsquo;This
      proceeding is more absurd than the other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it would be best to take it in,&rsquo; replied Mr. Ben Allen; &lsquo;it would
      serve him right to take it in and keep it, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;shall I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it the most proper course we could possibly adopt,&rsquo; replied Ben.
    </p>
    <p>
      This advice quite coinciding with his own opinion, Mr. Pickwick gently let
      down the window and disengaged the bottle from the stick; upon which the
      latter was drawn up, and Mr. Bob Sawyer was heard to laugh heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a merry dog it is!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking round at his
      companion, with the bottle in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is,&rsquo; said Mr. Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You cannot possibly be angry with him,&rsquo; remarked Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite out of the question,&rsquo; observed Benjamin Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this short interchange of sentiments, Mr. Pickwick had, in an
      abstracted mood, uncorked the bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; inquired Ben Allen carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, with equal carelessness. &lsquo;It smells,
      I think, like milk-punch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, indeed?&rsquo; said Ben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I <i>think </i>so,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick, very properly guarding himself
      against the possibility of stating an untruth; &lsquo;mind, I could not
      undertake to say certainly, without tasting it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better do so,&rsquo; said Ben; &lsquo;we may as well know what it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think so?&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Well; if you are curious to
      know, of course I have no objection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever willing to sacrifice his own feelings to the wishes of his friend,
      Mr. Pickwick at once took a pretty long taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; inquired Ben Allen, interrupting him with some impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Curious,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, smacking his lips, &lsquo;I hardly know, now. Oh,
      yes!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, after a second taste. &lsquo;It <i>is</i> punch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ben Allen looked at Mr. Pickwick; Mr. Pickwick looked at Mr. Ben
      Allen; Mr. Ben Allen smiled; Mr. Pickwick did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would serve him right,&rsquo; said the last-named gentleman, with some
      severity&mdash;&lsquo;it would serve him right to drink it every drop.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The very thing that occurred to me,&rsquo; said Ben Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it, indeed?&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Then here&rsquo;s his health!&rsquo; With
      these words, that excellent person took a most energetic pull at the
      bottle, and handed it to Ben Allen, who was not slow to imitate his
      example. The smiles became mutual, and the milk-punch was gradually and
      cheerfully disposed of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After all,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as he drained the last drop, &lsquo;his pranks
      are really very amusing; very entertaining indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may say that,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Ben Allen. In proof of Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s being
      one of the funniest fellows alive, he proceeded to entertain Mr. Pickwick
      with a long and circumstantial account how that gentleman once drank
      himself into a fever and got his head shaved; the relation of which
      pleasant and agreeable history was only stopped by the stoppage of the
      chaise at the Bell at Berkeley Heath, to change horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say! We&rsquo;re going to dine here, aren&rsquo;t we?&rsquo; said Bob, looking in at the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dine!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Why, we have only come nineteen miles, and
      have eighty-seven and a half to go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just the reason why we should take something to enable us to bear up
      against the fatigue,&rsquo; remonstrated Mr. Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s quite impossible to dine at half-past eleven o&rsquo;clock in the
      day,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, looking at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; rejoined Bob, &lsquo;lunch is the very thing. Hollo, you sir! Lunch
      for three, directly; and keep the horses back for a quarter of an hour.
      Tell them to put everything they have cold, on the table, and some bottled
      ale, and let us taste your very best Madeira.&rsquo; Issuing these orders with
      monstrous importance and bustle, Mr. Bob Sawyer at once hurried into the
      house to superintend the arrangements; in less than five minutes he
      returned and declared them to be excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quality of the lunch fully justified the eulogium which Bob had
      pronounced, and very great justice was done to it, not only by that
      gentleman, but Mr. Ben Allen and Mr. Pickwick also. Under the auspices of
      the three, the bottled ale and the Madeira were promptly disposed of; and
      when (the horses being once more put to) they resumed their seats, with
      the case-bottle full of the best substitute for milk-punch that could be
      procured on so short a notice, the key-bugle sounded, and the red flag
      waved, without the slightest opposition on Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s part.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Hop Pole at Tewkesbury, they stopped to dine; upon which occasion
      there was more bottled ale, with some more Madeira, and some port besides;
      and here the case-bottle was replenished for the fourth time. Under the
      influence of these combined stimulants, Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Ben Allen
      fell fast asleep for thirty miles, while Bob and Mr. Weller sang duets in
      the dickey.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite dark when Mr. Pickwick roused himself sufficiently to look
      out of the window. The straggling cottages by the road-side, the dingy hue
      of every object visible, the murky atmosphere, the paths of cinders and
      brick-dust, the deep-red glow of furnace fires in the distance, the
      volumes of dense smoke issuing heavily forth from high toppling chimneys,
      blackening and obscuring everything around; the glare of distant lights,
      the ponderous wagons which toiled along the road, laden with clashing rods
      of iron, or piled with heavy goods&mdash;all betokened their rapid
      approach to the great working town of Birmingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they rattled through the narrow thoroughfares leading to the heart of
      the turmoil, the sights and sounds of earnest occupation struck more
      forcibly on the senses. The streets were thronged with working people. The
      hum of labour resounded from every house; lights gleamed from the long
      casement windows in the attic storeys, and the whirl of wheels and noise
      of machinery shook the trembling walls. The fires, whose lurid, sullen
      light had been visible for miles, blazed fiercely up, in the great works
      and factories of the town. The din of hammers, the rushing of steam, and
      the dead heavy clanking of engines, was the harsh music which arose from
      every quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postboy was driving briskly through the open streets, and past the
      handsome and well-lighted shops that intervene between the outskirts of
      the town and the Old Royal Hotel, before Mr. Pickwick had begun to
      consider the very difficult and delicate nature of the commission which
      had carried him thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delicate nature of this commission, and the difficulty of executing it
      in a satisfactory manner, were by no means lessened by the voluntary
      companionship of Mr. Bob Sawyer. Truth to tell, Mr. Pickwick felt that his
      presence on the occasion, however considerate and gratifying, was by no
      means an honour he would willingly have sought; in fact, he would
      cheerfully have given a reasonable sum of money to have had Mr. Bob Sawyer
      removed to any place at not less than fifty miles&rsquo; distance, without
      delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick had never held any personal communication with Mr. Winkle,
      senior, although he had once or twice corresponded with him by letter, and
      returned satisfactory answers to his inquiries concerning the moral
      character and behaviour of his son; he felt nervously sensible that to
      wait upon him, for the first time, attended by Bob Sawyer and Ben Allen,
      both slightly fuddled, was not the most ingenious and likely means that
      could have been hit upon to prepossess him in his favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;However,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, endeavouring to reassure himself, &lsquo;I must do
      the best I can. I must see him to-night, for I faithfully promised to do
      so. If they persist in accompanying me, I must make the interview as brief
      as possible, and be content that, for their own sakes, they will not
      expose themselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he comforted himself with these reflections, the chaise stopped at the
      door of the Old Royal. Ben Allen having been partially awakened from a
      stupendous sleep, and dragged out by the collar by Mr. Samuel Weller, Mr.
      Pickwick was enabled to alight. They were shown to a comfortable
      apartment, and Mr. Pickwick at once propounded a question to the waiter
      concerning the whereabout of Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Close by, Sir,&rsquo; said the waiter, &lsquo;not above five hundred yards, Sir. Mr.
      Winkle is a wharfinger, Sir, at the canal, sir. Private residence is not&mdash;oh
      dear, no, sir, not five hundred yards, sir.&rsquo; Here the waiter blew a candle
      out, and made a feint of lighting it again, in order to afford Mr.
      Pickwick an opportunity of asking any further questions, if he felt so
      disposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take anything now, Sir?&rsquo; said the waiter, lighting the candle in
      desperation at Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s silence. &lsquo;Tea or coffee, Sir? Dinner, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good, sir. Like to order supper, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not just now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good, Sir.&rsquo; Here, he walked slowly to the door, and then stopping
      short, turned round and said, with great suavity&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I send the chambermaid, gentlemen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may if you please,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If <i>you </i>please, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And bring some soda-water,&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Soda-water, Sir! Yes, Sir.&rsquo; With his mind apparently relieved from an
      overwhelming weight, by having at last got an order for something, the
      waiter imperceptibly melted away. Waiters never walk or run. They have a
      peculiar and mysterious power of skimming out of rooms, which other
      mortals possess not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some slight symptoms of vitality having been awakened in Mr. Ben Allen by
      the soda-water, he suffered himself to be prevailed upon to wash his face
      and hands, and to submit to be brushed by Sam. Mr. Pickwick and Bob Sawyer
      having also repaired the disorder which the journey had made in their
      apparel, the three started forth, arm in arm, to Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s; Bob Sawyer
      impregnating the atmosphere with tobacco smoke as he walked along.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a quarter of a mile off, in a quiet, substantial-looking street,
      stood an old red brick house with three steps before the door, and a brass
      plate upon it, bearing, in fat Roman capitals, the words, &lsquo;Mr. Winkle.&rsquo; 
      The steps were very white, and the bricks were very red, and the house was
      very clean; and here stood Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Benjamin Allen, and Mr. Bob
      Sawyer, as the clock struck ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smart servant-girl answered the knock, and started on beholding the
      three strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Mr. Winkle at home, my dear?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is just going to supper, Sir,&rsquo; replied the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give him that card if you please,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Say I am sorry
      to trouble him at so late an hour; but I am anxious to see him to-night,
      and have only just arrived.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked timidly at Mr. Bob Sawyer, who was expressing his
      admiration of her personal charms by a variety of wonderful grimaces; and
      casting an eye at the hats and greatcoats which hung in the passage,
      called another girl to mind the door while she went upstairs. The sentinel
      was speedily relieved; for the girl returned immediately, and begging
      pardon of the gentlemen for leaving them in the street, ushered them into
      a floor-clothed back parlour, half office and half dressing room, in which
      the principal useful and ornamental articles of furniture were a desk, a
      wash-hand stand and shaving-glass, a boot-rack and boot-jack, a high
      stool, four chairs, a table, and an old eight-day clock. Over the
      mantelpiece were the sunken doors of an iron safe, while a couple of
      hanging shelves for books, an almanac, and several files of dusty papers,
      decorated the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very sorry to leave you standing at the door, Sir,&rsquo; said the girl,
      lighting a lamp, and addressing Mr. Pickwick with a winning smile, &lsquo;but
      you was quite strangers to me; and we have such a many trampers that only
      come to see what they can lay their hands on, that really&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is not the least occasion for any apology, my dear,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Pickwick good-humouredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not the slightest, my love,&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer, playfully stretching forth
      his arms, and skipping from side to side, as if to prevent the young
      lady&rsquo;s leaving the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady was not at all softened by these allurements, for she at
      once expressed her opinion, that Mr. Bob Sawyer was an &lsquo;odous creetur;&rsquo; 
      and, on his becoming rather more pressing in his attentions, imprinted her
      fair fingers upon his face, and bounced out of the room with many
      expressions of aversion and contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deprived of the young lady&rsquo;s society, Mr. Bob Sawyer proceeded to divert
      himself by peeping into the desk, looking into all the table drawers,
      feigning to pick the lock of the iron safe, turning the almanac with its
      face to the wall, trying on the boots of Mr. Winkle, senior, over his own,
      and making several other humorous experiments upon the furniture, all of
      which afforded Mr. Pickwick unspeakable horror and agony, and yielded Mr.
      Bob Sawyer proportionate delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the door opened, and a little old gentleman in a snuff-coloured
      suit, with a head and face the precise counterpart of those belonging to
      Mr. Winkle, junior, excepting that he was rather bald, trotted into the
      room with Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s card in one hand, and a silver candlestick in the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick, sir, how do you do?&rsquo; said Winkle the elder, putting down
      the candlestick and proffering his hand. &lsquo;Hope I see you well, sir. Glad
      to see you. Be seated, Mr. Pickwick, I beg, Sir. This gentleman is&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friend, Mr. Sawyer,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;your son&rsquo;s friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle the elder, looking rather grimly at Bob. &lsquo;I hope you
      are well, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Right as a trivet, sir,&rsquo; replied Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This other gentleman,&rsquo; cried Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;is, as you will see when you
      have read the letter with which I am intrusted, a very near relative, or I
      should rather say a very particular friend of your son&rsquo;s. His name is
      Allen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>That </i>gentleman?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Winkle, pointing with the card
      towards Ben Allen, who had fallen asleep in an attitude which left nothing
      of him visible but his spine and his coat collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick was on the point of replying to the question, and reciting
      Mr. Benjamin Allen&rsquo;s name and honourable distinctions at full length, when
      the sprightly Mr. Bob Sawyer, with a view of rousing his friend to a sense
      of his situation, inflicted a startling pinch upon the fleshly part of his
      arm, which caused him to jump up with a shriek. Suddenly aware that he was
      in the presence of a stranger, Mr. Ben Allen advanced and, shaking Mr.
      Winkle most affectionately by both hands for about five minutes, murmured,
      in some half-intelligible fragments of sentences, the great delight he
      felt in seeing him, and a hospitable inquiry whether he felt disposed to
      take anything after his walk, or would prefer waiting &lsquo;till dinner-time;&rsquo; 
      which done, he sat down and gazed about him with a petrified stare, as if
      he had not the remotest idea where he was, which indeed he had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was most embarrassing to Mr. Pickwick, the more especially as Mr.
      Winkle, senior, evinced palpable astonishment at the eccentric&mdash;not
      to say extraordinary&mdash;behaviour of his two companions. To bring the
      matter to an issue at once, he drew a letter from his pocket, and
      presenting it to Mr. Winkle, senior, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This letter, Sir, is from your son. You will see, by its contents, that
      on your favourable and fatherly consideration of it, depend his future
      happiness and welfare. Will you oblige me by giving it the calmest and
      coolest perusal, and by discussing the subject afterwards with me, in the
      tone and spirit in which alone it ought to be discussed? You may judge of
      the importance of your decision to your son, and his intense anxiety upon
      the subject, by my waiting upon you, without any previous warning, at so
      late an hour; and,&rsquo; added Mr. Pickwick, glancing slightly at his two
      companions&mdash;&lsquo;and under such unfavourable circumstances.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this prelude, Mr. Pickwick placed four closely-written sides of extra
      superfine wire-wove penitence in the hands of the astounded Mr. Winkle,
      senior. Then reseating himself in his chair, he watched his looks and
      manner: anxiously, it is true, but with the open front of a gentleman who
      feels he has taken no part which he need excuse or palliate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old wharfinger turned the letter over, looked at the front, back, and
      sides, made a microscopic examination of the fat little boy on the seal,
      raised his eyes to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s face, and then, seating himself on the
      high stool, and drawing the lamp closer to him, broke the wax, unfolded
      the epistle, and lifting it to the light, prepared to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this moment, Mr. Bob Sawyer, whose wit had lain dormant for some
      minutes, placed his hands on his knees, and made a face after the
      portraits of the late Mr. Grimaldi, as clown. It so happened that Mr.
      Winkle, senior, instead of being deeply engaged in reading the letter, as
      Mr. Bob Sawyer thought, chanced to be looking over the top of it at no
      less a person than Mr. Bob Sawyer himself; rightly conjecturing that the
      face aforesaid was made in ridicule and derision of his own person, he
      fixed his eyes on Bob with such expressive sternness, that the late Mr.
      Grimaldi&rsquo;s lineaments gradually resolved themselves into a very fine
      expression of humility and confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you speak, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Winkle, senior, after an awful silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; replied Bob, With no remains of the clown about him, save and
      except the extreme redness of his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are sure you did not, sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, senior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear, yes, sir, quite,&rsquo; replied Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you did, Sir,&rsquo; replied the old gentleman, with indignant
      emphasis. &lsquo;Perhaps you <i>looked </i>at me, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no! sir, not at all,&rsquo; replied Bob, with extreme civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very glad to hear it, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, senior. Having frowned
      upon the abashed Bob with great magnificence, the old gentleman again
      brought the letter to the light, and began to read it seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick eyed him intently as he turned from the bottom line of the
      first page to the top line of the second, and from the bottom of the
      second to the top of the third, and from the bottom of the third to the
      top of the fourth; but not the slightest alteration of countenance
      afforded a clue to the feelings with which he received the announcement of
      his son&rsquo;s marriage, which Mr. Pickwick knew was in the very first
      half-dozen lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read the letter to the last word, folded it again with all the
      carefulness and precision of a man of business, and, just when Mr.
      Pickwick expected some great outbreak of feeling, dipped a pen in the
      ink-stand, and said, as quietly as if he were speaking on the most
      ordinary counting-house topic&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is Nathaniel&rsquo;s address, Mr. Pickwick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The George and Vulture, at present,&rsquo; replied that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;George and Vulture. Where is that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;George Yard, Lombard Street.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the city?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman methodically indorsed the address on the back of the
      letter; and then, placing it in the desk, which he locked, said, as he got
      off the stool and put the bunch of keys in his pocket&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose there is nothing else which need detain us, Mr. Pickwick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing else, my dear Sir!&rsquo; observed that warm-hearted person in
      indignant amazement. &lsquo;Nothing else! Have you no opinion to express on this
      momentous event in our young friend&rsquo;s life? No assurance to convey to him,
      through me, of the continuance of your affection and protection? Nothing
      to say which will cheer and sustain him, and the anxious girl who looks to
      him for comfort and support? My dear Sir, consider.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will consider,&rsquo; replied the old gentleman. &lsquo;I have nothing to say just
      now. I am a man of business, Mr. Pickwick. I never commit myself hastily
      in any affair, and from what I see of this, I by no means like the
      appearance of it. A thousand pounds is not much, Mr. Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re very right, Sir,&rsquo; interposed Ben Allen, just awake enough to know
      that he had spent his thousand pounds without the smallest difficulty.
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re an intelligent man. Bob, he&rsquo;s a very knowing fellow this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very happy to find that you do me the justice to make the admission,
      sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, senior, looking contemptuously at Ben Allen, who
      was shaking his head profoundly. &lsquo;The fact is, Mr. Pickwick, that when I
      gave my son a roving license for a year or so, to see something of men and
      manners (which he has done under your auspices), so that he might not
      enter life a mere boarding-school milk-sop to be gulled by everybody, I
      never bargained for this. He knows that very well, so if I withdraw my
      countenance from him on this account, he has no call to be surprised. He
      shall hear from me, Mr. Pickwick. Good-night, sir.&mdash;Margaret, open
      the door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time, Bob Sawyer had been nudging Mr. Ben Allen to say something
      on the right side; Ben accordingly now burst, without the slightest
      preliminary notice, into a brief but impassioned piece of eloquence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Ben Allen, staring at the old gentleman, out of a pair of
      very dim and languid eyes, and working his right arm vehemently up and
      down, &lsquo;you&mdash;you ought to be ashamed of yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As the lady&rsquo;s brother, of course you are an excellent judge of the
      question,&rsquo; retorted Mr. Winkle, senior. &lsquo;There; that&rsquo;s enough. Pray say no
      more, Mr. Pickwick. Good-night, gentlemen!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words the old gentleman took up the candle-stick and opening
      the room door, politely motioned towards the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will regret this, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, setting his teeth close
      together to keep down his choler; for he felt how important the effect
      might prove to his young friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am at present of a different opinion,&rsquo; calmly replied Mr. Winkle,
      senior. &lsquo;Once again, gentlemen, I wish you a good-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick walked with angry strides into the street. Mr. Bob Sawyer,
      completely quelled by the decision of the old gentleman&rsquo;s manner, took the
      same course. Mr. Ben Allen&rsquo;s hat rolled down the steps immediately
      afterwards, and Mr. Ben Allen&rsquo;s body followed it directly. The whole party
      went silent and supperless to bed; and Mr. Pickwick thought, just before
      he fell asleep, that if he had known Mr. Winkle, senior, had been quite so
      much of a man of business, it was extremely probable he might never have
      waited upon him, on such an errand.

      THRILLING INTEREST HEREIN SET DOWN, CONCERNING TWO GREAT PUBLIC MEN OF
      MIGHT AND POWER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he morning which
      broke upon Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s sight at eight o&rsquo;clock, was not at all
      calculated to elevate his spirits, or to lessen the depression which the
      unlooked-for result of his embassy inspired. The sky was dark and gloomy,
      the air was damp and raw, the streets were wet and sloppy. The smoke hung
      sluggishly above the chimney-tops as if it lacked the courage to rise, and
      the rain came slowly and doggedly down, as if it had not even the spirit
      to pour. A game-cock in the stableyard, deprived of every spark of his
      accustomed animation, balanced himself dismally on one leg in a corner; a
      donkey, moping with drooping head under the narrow roof of an outhouse,
      appeared from his meditative and miserable countenance to be contemplating
      suicide. In the street, umbrellas were the only things to be seen, and the
      clicking of pattens and splashing of rain-drops were the only sounds to be
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast was interrupted by very little conversation; even Mr. Bob
      Sawyer felt the influence of the weather, and the previous day&rsquo;s
      excitement. In his own expressive language he was &lsquo;floored.&rsquo; So was Mr.
      Ben Allen. So was Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      In protracted expectation of the weather clearing up, the last evening
      paper from London was read and re-read with an intensity of interest only
      known in cases of extreme destitution; every inch of the carpet was walked
      over with similar perseverance; the windows were looked out of, often
      enough to justify the imposition of an additional duty upon them; all
      kinds of topics of conversation were started, and failed; and at length
      Mr. Pickwick, when noon had arrived, without a change for the better, rang
      the bell resolutely, and ordered out the chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the roads were miry, and the drizzling rain came down harder than
      it had done yet, and although the mud and wet splashed in at the open
      windows of the carriage to such an extent that the discomfort was almost
      as great to the pair of insides as to the pair of outsides, still there
      was something in the motion, and the sense of being up and doing, which
      was so infinitely superior to being pent in a dull room, looking at the
      dull rain dripping into a dull street, that they all agreed, on starting,
      that the change was a great improvement, and wondered how they could
      possibly have delayed making it as long as they had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they stopped to change at Coventry, the steam ascended from the
      horses in such clouds as wholly to obscure the hostler, whose voice was
      however heard to declare from the mist, that he expected the first gold
      medal from the Humane Society on their next distribution of rewards, for
      taking the postboy&rsquo;s hat off; the water descending from the brim of which,
      the invisible gentleman declared, must have drowned him (the postboy), but
      for his great presence of mind in tearing it promptly from his head, and
      drying the gasping man&rsquo;s countenance with a wisp of straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is pleasant,&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer, turning up his coat collar, and
      pulling the shawl over his mouth to concentrate the fumes of a glass of
      brandy just swallowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery,&rsquo; replied Sam composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to mind it,&rsquo; observed Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vy, I don&rsquo;t exactly see no good my mindin&rsquo; on it &lsquo;ud do, sir,&rsquo; replied
      Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s an unanswerable reason, anyhow,&rsquo; said Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Wotever is, is right, as the young
      nobleman sweetly remarked wen they put him down in the pension list &lsquo;cos
      his mother&rsquo;s uncle&rsquo;s vife&rsquo;s grandfather vunce lit the king&rsquo;s pipe vith a
      portable tinder-box.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a bad notion that, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just wot the young nobleman said ev&rsquo;ry quarter-day arterwards for the
      rest of his life,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wos you ever called in,&rsquo; inquired Sam, glancing at the driver, after a
      short silence, and lowering his voice to a mysterious whisper&mdash;&lsquo;wos
      you ever called in, when you wos &lsquo;prentice to a sawbones, to wisit a
      postboy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t remember that I ever was,&rsquo; replied Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You never see a postboy in that &lsquo;ere hospital as you <i>walked </i>(as
      they says o&rsquo; the ghosts), did you?&rsquo; demanded Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Bob Sawyer. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never know&rsquo;d a churchyard were there wos a postboy&rsquo;s tombstone, or see a
      dead postboy, did you?&rsquo; inquired Sam, pursuing his catechism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; rejoined Bob, &lsquo;I never did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; rejoined Sam triumphantly. &lsquo;Nor never vill; and there&rsquo;s another
      thing that no man never see, and that&rsquo;s a dead donkey. No man never see a
      dead donkey &lsquo;cept the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n in the black silk smalls as know&rsquo;d the
      young &lsquo;ooman as kep&rsquo; a goat; and that wos a French donkey, so wery likely
      he warn&rsquo;t wun o&rsquo; the reg&rsquo;lar breed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what has that got to do with the postboys?&rsquo; asked Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This here,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;Without goin&rsquo; so far as to as-sert, as some
      wery sensible people do, that postboys and donkeys is both immortal, wot I
      say is this: that wenever they feels theirselves gettin&rsquo; stiff and past
      their work, they just rides off together, wun postboy to a pair in the
      usual way; wot becomes on &lsquo;em nobody knows, but it&rsquo;s wery probable as they
      starts avay to take their pleasure in some other vorld, for there ain&rsquo;t a
      man alive as ever see either a donkey or a postboy a-takin&rsquo; his pleasure
      in this!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Expatiating upon this learned and remarkable theory, and citing many
      curious statistical and other facts in its support, Sam Weller beguiled
      the time until they reached Dunchurch, where a dry postboy and fresh
      horses were procured; the next stage was Daventry, and the next Towcester;
      and at the end of each stage it rained harder than it had done at the
      beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; remonstrated Bob Sawyer, looking in at the coach window, as they
      pulled up before the door of the Saracen&rsquo;s Head, Towcester, &lsquo;this won&rsquo;t
      do, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless me!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, just awakening from a nap, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
      you&rsquo;re wet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you are, are you?&rsquo; returned Bob. &lsquo;Yes, I am, a little that way,
      Uncomfortably damp, perhaps.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob did look dampish, inasmuch as the rain was streaming from his neck,
      elbows, cuffs, skirts, and knees; and his whole apparel shone so with the
      wet, that it might have been mistaken for a full suit of prepared oilskin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I <i>am</i> rather wet,&rsquo; said Bob, giving himself a shake and casting a
      little hydraulic shower around, like a Newfoundland dog just emerged from
      the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s quite impossible to go on to-night,&rsquo; interposed Ben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Out of the question, sir,&rsquo; remarked Sam Weller, coming to assist in the
      conference; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a cruelty to animals, sir, to ask &lsquo;em to do it. There&rsquo;s
      beds here, sir,&rsquo; said Sam, addressing his master, &lsquo;everything clean and
      comfortable. Wery good little dinner, sir, they can get ready in half an
      hour&mdash;pair of fowls, sir, and a weal cutlet; French beans, &lsquo;taturs,
      tart, and tidiness. You&rsquo;d better stop vere you are, sir, if I might
      recommend. Take adwice, sir, as the doctor said.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The host of the Saracen&rsquo;s Head opportunely appeared at this moment, to
      confirm Mr. Weller&rsquo;s statement relative to the accommodations of the
      establishment, and to back his entreaties with a variety of dismal
      conjectures regarding the state of the roads, the doubt of fresh horses
      being to be had at the next stage, the dead certainty of its raining all
      night, the equally mortal certainty of its clearing up in the morning, and
      other topics of inducement familiar to innkeepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;but I must send a letter to London by some
      conveyance, so that it may be delivered the very first thing in the
      morning, or I must go forwards at all hazards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord smiled his delight. Nothing could be easier than for the
      gentleman to inclose a letter in a sheet of brown paper, and send it on,
      either by the mail or the night coach from Birmingham. If the gentleman
      were particularly anxious to have it left as soon as possible, he might
      write outside, &lsquo;To be delivered immediately,&rsquo; which was sure to be
      attended to; or &lsquo;Pay the bearer half-a-crown extra for instant delivery,&rsquo; 
      which was surer still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;then we will stop here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lights in the Sun, John; make up the fire; the gentlemen are wet!&rsquo; cried
      the landlord. &lsquo;This way, gentlemen; don&rsquo;t trouble yourselves about the
      postboy now, sir. I&rsquo;ll send him to you when you ring for him, sir. Now,
      John, the candles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The candles were brought, the fire was stirred up, and a fresh log of wood
      thrown on. In ten minutes&rsquo; time, a waiter was laying the cloth for dinner,
      the curtains were drawn, the fire was blazing brightly, and everything
      looked (as everything always does, in all decent English inns) as if the
      travellers had been expected, and their comforts prepared, for days
      beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick sat down at a side table, and hastily indited a note to Mr.
      Winkle, merely informing him that he was detained by stress of weather,
      but would certainly be in London next day; until when he deferred any
      account of his proceedings. This note was hastily made into a parcel, and
      despatched to the bar per Mr. Samuel Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam left it with the landlady, and was returning to pull his master&rsquo;s
      boots off, after drying himself by the kitchen fire, when glancing
      casually through a half-opened door, he was arrested by the sight of a
      gentleman with a sandy head who had a large bundle of newspapers lying on
      the table before him, and was perusing the leading article of one with a
      settled sneer which curled up his nose and all other features into a
      majestic expression of haughty contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo!&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;I ought to know that &lsquo;ere head and them features; the
      eyeglass, too, and the broad-brimmed tile! Eatansvill to vit, or I&rsquo;m a
      Roman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam was taken with a troublesome cough, at once, for the purpose of
      attracting the gentleman&rsquo;s attention; the gentleman starting at the sound,
      raised his head and his eyeglass, and disclosed to view the profound and
      thoughtful features of Mr. Pott, of the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beggin&rsquo; your pardon, sir,&rsquo; said Sam, advancing with a bow, &lsquo;my master&rsquo;s
      here, Mr. Pott.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! hush!&rsquo; cried Pott, drawing Sam into the room, and closing the door,
      with a countenance of mysterious dread and apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s the matter, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Sam, looking vacantly about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a whisper of my name,&rsquo; replied Pott; &lsquo;this is a buff neighbourhood.
      If the excited and irritable populace knew I was here, I should be torn to
      pieces.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! Vould you, sir?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be the victim of their fury,&rsquo; replied Pott. &lsquo;Now young man, what
      of your master?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a-stopping here to-night on his vay to town, with a couple of
      friends,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Mr. Winkle one of them?&rsquo; inquired Pott, with a slight frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Sir. Mr. Vinkle stops at home now,&rsquo; rejoined Sam. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Married!&rsquo; exclaimed Pott, with frightful vehemence. He stopped, smiled
      darkly, and added, in a low, vindictive tone, &lsquo;It serves him right!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having given vent to this cruel ebullition of deadly malice and
      cold-blooded triumph over a fallen enemy, Mr. Pott inquired whether Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s friends were &lsquo;blue?&rsquo; Receiving a most satisfactory answer in
      the affirmative from Sam, who knew as much about the matter as Pott
      himself, he consented to accompany him to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s room, where a
      hearty welcome awaited him, and an agreement to club their dinners
      together was at once made and ratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how are matters going on in Eatanswill?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, when
      Pott had taken a seat near the fire, and the whole party had got their wet
      boots off, and dry slippers on. &lsquo;Is the <i>Independent</i> still in
      being?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The <i>Independent</i>, sir,&rsquo; replied Pott, &lsquo;is still dragging on a
      wretched and lingering career. Abhorred and despised by even the few who
      are cognisant of its miserable and disgraceful existence, stifled by the
      very filth it so profusely scatters, rendered deaf and blind by the
      exhalations of its own slime, the obscene journal, happily unconscious of
      its degraded state, is rapidly sinking beneath that treacherous mud which,
      while it seems to give it a firm standing with the low and debased classes
      of society, is nevertheless rising above its detested head, and will
      speedily engulf it for ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having delivered this manifesto (which formed a portion of his last week&rsquo;s
      leader) with vehement articulation, the editor paused to take breath, and
      looked majestically at Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a young man, sir,&rsquo; said Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bob Sawyer nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So are you, sir,&rsquo; said Pott, addressing Mr. Ben Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben admitted the soft impeachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And are both deeply imbued with those blue principles, which, so long as
      I live, I have pledged myself to the people of these kingdoms to support
      and to maintain?&rsquo; suggested Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t exactly know about that,&rsquo; replied Bob Sawyer. &lsquo;I am&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not buff, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; interrupted Pott, drawing back his chair, &lsquo;your
      friend is not buff, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; rejoined Bob, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a kind of plaid at present; a compound of all
      sorts of colours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A waverer,&rsquo; said Pott solemnly, &lsquo;a waverer. I should like to show you a
      series of eight articles, Sir, that have appeared in the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i>.
      I think I may venture to say that you would not be long in establishing
      your opinions on a firm and solid blue basis, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I dare say I should turn very blue, long before I got to the end of them,&rsquo; 
      responded Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pott looked dubiously at Bob Sawyer for some seconds, and, turning to
      Mr. Pickwick, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have seen the literary articles which have appeared at intervals in
      the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i> in the course of the last three months, and
      which have excited such general&mdash;I may say such universal&mdash;attention
      and admiration?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, slightly embarrassed by the question, &lsquo;the
      fact is, I have been so much engaged in other ways, that I really have not
      had an opportunity of perusing them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should do so, Sir,&rsquo; said Pott, with a severe countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They appeared in the form of a copious review of a work on Chinese
      metaphysics, Sir,&rsquo; said Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; observed Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;from your pen, I hope?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From the pen of my critic, Sir,&rsquo; rejoined Pott, with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An abstruse subject, I should conceive,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very, Sir,&rsquo; responded Pott, looking intensely sage. &lsquo;He <i>crammed </i>for
      it, to use a technical but expressive term; he read up for the subject, at
      my desire, in the &ldquo;Encyclopaedia Britannica.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;I was not aware that that valuable work
      contained any information respecting Chinese metaphysics.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He read, Sir,&rsquo; rejoined Pott, laying his hand on Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s knee, and
      looking round with a smile of intellectual superiority&mdash;&lsquo;he read for
      metaphysics under the letter M, and for China under the letter C, and
      combined his information, Sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pott&rsquo;s features assumed so much additional grandeur at the
      recollection of the power and research displayed in the learned effusions
      in question, that some minutes elapsed before Mr. Pickwick felt emboldened
      to renew the conversation; at length, as the editor&rsquo;s countenance
      gradually relaxed into its customary expression of moral supremacy, he
      ventured to resume the discourse by asking&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it fair to inquire what great object has brought you so far from
      home?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That object which actuates and animates me in all my gigantic labours,
      Sir,&rsquo; replied Pott, with a calm smile: &lsquo;my country&rsquo;s good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I supposed it was some public mission,&rsquo; observed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Sir,&rsquo; resumed Pott, &lsquo;it is.&rsquo; Here, bending towards Mr. Pickwick, he
      whispered in a deep, hollow voice, &lsquo;A Buff ball, Sir, will take place in
      Birmingham to-morrow evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God bless me!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Sir, and supper,&rsquo; added Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rsquo; ejaculated Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pott nodded portentously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, although Mr. Pickwick feigned to stand aghast at this disclosure, he
      was so little versed in local politics that he was unable to form an
      adequate comprehension of the importance of the dire conspiracy it
      referred to; observing which, Mr. Pott, drawing forth the last number of
      the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i>, and referring to the same, delivered
      himself of the following paragraph:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          HOLE-AND-CORNER BUFFERY.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A reptile contemporary has recently sweltered forth his black venom in
      the vain and hopeless attempt of sullying the fair name of our
      distinguished and excellent representative, the Honourable Mr. Slumkey&mdash;that
      Slumkey whom we, long before he gained his present noble and exalted
      position, predicted would one day be, as he now is, at once his country&rsquo;s
      brightest honour, and her proudest boast: alike her bold defender and her
      honest pride&mdash;our reptile contemporary, we say, has made himself
      merry, at the expense of a superbly embossed plated coal-scuttle, which
      has been presented to that glorious man by his enraptured constituents,
      and towards the purchase of which, the nameless wretch insinuates, the
      Honourable Mr. Slumkey himself contributed, through a confidential friend
      of his butler&rsquo;s, more than three-fourths of the whole sum subscribed. Why,
      does not the crawling creature see, that even if this be the fact, the
      Honourable Mr. Slumkey only appears in a still more amiable and radiant
      light than before, if that be possible? Does not even his obtuseness
      perceive that this amiable and touching desire to carry out the wishes of
      the constituent body, must for ever endear him to the hearts and souls of
      such of his fellow townsmen as are not worse than swine; or, in other
      words, who are not as debased as our contemporary himself? But such is the
      wretched trickery of hole-and-corner Buffery! These are not its only
      artifices. Treason is abroad. We boldly state, now that we are goaded to
      the disclosure, and we throw ourselves on the country and its constables
      for protection&mdash;we boldly state that secret preparations are at this
      moment in progress for a Buff ball; which is to be held in a Buff town, in
      the very heart and centre of a Buff population; which is to be conducted
      by a Buff master of the ceremonies; which is to be attended by four ultra
      Buff members of Parliament, and the admission to which, is to be by Buff
      tickets! Does our fiendish contemporary wince? Let him writhe, in impotent
      malice, as we pen the words, <i>We will be there</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, Sir,&rsquo; said Pott, folding up the paper quite exhausted, &lsquo;that is
      the state of the case!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord and waiter entering at the moment with dinner, caused Mr.
      Pott to lay his finger on his lips, in token that he considered his life
      in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s hands, and depended on his secrecy. Messrs. Bob Sawyer
      and Benjamin Allen, who had irreverently fallen asleep during the reading
      of the quotation from the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i>, and the discussion
      which followed it, were roused by the mere whispering of the talismanic
      word &lsquo;Dinner&rsquo; in their ears; and to dinner they went with good digestion
      waiting on appetite, and health on both, and a waiter on all three.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the dinner and the sitting which succeeded it, Mr. Pott
      descending, for a few moments, to domestic topics, informed Mr. Pickwick
      that the air of Eatanswill not agreeing with his lady, she was then
      engaged in making a tour of different fashionable watering-places with a
      view to the recovery of her wonted health and spirits; this was a delicate
      veiling of the fact that Mrs. Pott, acting upon her often-repeated threat
      of separation, had, in virtue of an arrangement negotiated by her brother,
      the lieutenant, and concluded by Mr. Pott, permanently retired with the
      faithful bodyguard upon one moiety or half part of the annual income and
      profits arising from the editorship and sale of the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the great Mr. Pott was dwelling upon this and other matters,
      enlivening the conversation from time to time with various extracts from
      his own lucubrations, a stern stranger, calling from the window of a
      stage-coach, outward bound, which halted at the inn to deliver packages,
      requested to know whether if he stopped short on his journey and remained
      there for the night, he could be furnished with the necessary
      accommodation of a bed and bedstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, sir,&rsquo; replied the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can, can I?&rsquo; inquired the stranger, who seemed habitually suspicious in
      look and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt of it, Sir,&rsquo; replied the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good,&rsquo; said the stranger. &lsquo;Coachman, I get down here. Guard, my
      carpet-bag!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bidding the other passengers good-night, in a rather snappish manner, the
      stranger alighted. He was a shortish gentleman, with very stiff black hair
      cut in the porcupine or blacking-brush style, and standing stiff and
      straight all over his head; his aspect was pompous and threatening; his
      manner was peremptory; his eyes were sharp and restless; and his whole
      bearing bespoke a feeling of great confidence in himself, and a
      consciousness of immeasurable superiority over all other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gentleman was shown into the room originally assigned to the
      patriotic Mr. Pott; and the waiter remarked, in dumb astonishment at the
      singular coincidence, that he had no sooner lighted the candles than the
      gentleman, diving into his hat, drew forth a newspaper, and began to read
      it with the very same expression of indignant scorn, which, upon the
      majestic features of Pott, had paralysed his energies an hour before. The
      man observed too, that, whereas Mr. Pott&rsquo;s scorn had been roused by a
      newspaper headed the Eatanswill <i>Independent</i>, this gentleman&rsquo;s
      withering contempt was awakened by a newspaper entitled the Eatanswill <i>Gazette</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Send the landlord,&rsquo; said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; rejoined the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord was sent, and came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you the landlord?&rsquo; inquired the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sir,&rsquo; replied the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know me?&rsquo; demanded the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not had that pleasure, Sir,&rsquo; rejoined the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name is Slurk,&rsquo; said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord slightly inclined his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Slurk, sir,&rsquo; repeated the gentleman haughtily. &lsquo;Do you know me now, man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord scratched his head, looked at the ceiling, and at the
      stranger, and smiled feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know me, man?&rsquo; inquired the stranger angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord made a strong effort, and at length replied, &lsquo;Well, Sir, I do
      <i>not</i> know you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Great Heaven!&rsquo; said the stranger, dashing his clenched fist upon the
      table. &lsquo;And this is popularity!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord took a step or two towards the door; the stranger fixing his
      eyes upon him, resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said the stranger&mdash;&lsquo;this is gratitude for years of labour and
      study in behalf of the masses. I alight wet and weary; no enthusiastic
      crowds press forward to greet their champion; the church bells are silent;
      the very name elicits no responsive feeling in their torpid bosoms. It is
      enough,&rsquo; said the agitated Mr. Slurk, pacing to and fro, &lsquo;to curdle the
      ink in one&rsquo;s pen, and induce one to abandon their cause for ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you say brandy-and-water, Sir?&rsquo; said the landlord, venturing a hint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rum,&rsquo; said Mr. Slurk, turning fiercely upon him. &lsquo;Have you got a fire
      anywhere?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can light one directly, Sir,&rsquo; said the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which will throw out no heat until it is bed-time,&rsquo; interrupted Mr.
      Slurk. &lsquo;Is there anybody in the kitchen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a soul. There was a beautiful fire. Everybody had gone, and the house
      door was closed for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will drink my rum-and-water,&rsquo; said Mr. Slurk, &lsquo;by the kitchen fire.&rsquo; 
      So, gathering up his hat and newspaper, he stalked solemnly behind the
      landlord to that humble apartment, and throwing himself on a settle by the
      fireside, resumed his countenance of scorn, and began to read and drink in
      silent dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, some demon of discord, flying over the Saracen&rsquo;s Head at that moment,
      on casting down his eyes in mere idle curiosity, happened to behold Slurk
      established comfortably by the kitchen fire, and Pott slightly elevated
      with wine in another room; upon which the malicious demon, darting down
      into the last-mentioned apartment with inconceivable rapidity, passed at
      once into the head of Mr. Bob Sawyer, and prompted him for his (the
      demon&rsquo;s) own evil purpose to speak as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, we&rsquo;ve let the fire out. It&rsquo;s uncommonly cold after the rain, isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It really is,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad notion to have a cigar by the kitchen fire, would
      it?&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer, still prompted by the demon aforesaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be particularly comfortable, I think,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
      &lsquo;Mr. Pott, what do you say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pott yielded a ready assent; and all four travellers, each with his
      glass in his hand, at once betook themselves to the kitchen, with Sam
      Weller heading the procession to show them the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger was still reading; he looked up and started. Mr. Pott
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; whispered Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That reptile!&rsquo; replied Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What reptile?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking about him for fear he should
      tread on some overgrown black beetle, or dropsical spider.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That reptile,&rsquo; whispered Pott, catching Mr. Pickwick by the arm, and
      pointing towards the stranger. &lsquo;That reptile Slurk, of the <i>Independent</i>!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps we had better retire,&rsquo; whispered Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never, Sir,&rsquo; rejoined Pott, pot-valiant in a double sense&mdash;&lsquo;never.&rsquo; 
      With these words, Mr. Pott took up his position on an opposite settle, and
      selecting one from a little bundle of newspapers, began to read against
      his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pott, of course read the <i>Independent</i>, and Mr. Slurk, of course,
      read the <i>Gazette</i>; and each gentleman audibly expressed his contempt
      at the other&rsquo;s compositions by bitter laughs and sarcastic sniffs; whence
      they proceeded to more open expressions of opinion, such as &lsquo;absurd,&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;wretched,&rsquo; &lsquo;atrocity,&rsquo; &lsquo;humbug,&rsquo; &lsquo;knavery&rsquo;, &lsquo;dirt,&rsquo; &lsquo;filth,&rsquo; &lsquo;slime,&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;ditch-water,&rsquo; and other critical remarks of the like nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Mr. Bob Sawyer and Mr. Ben Allen had beheld these symptoms of rivalry
      and hatred, with a degree of delight which imparted great additional
      relish to the cigars at which they were puffing most vigorously. The
      moment they began to flag, the mischievous Mr. Bob Sawyer, addressing
      Slurk with great politeness, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you allow me to look at your paper, Sir, when you have quite done
      with it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will find very little to repay you for your trouble in this
      contemptible <i>thing</i>, sir,&rsquo; replied Slurk, bestowing a Satanic frown
      on Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall have this presently,&rsquo; said Pott, looking up, pale with rage,
      and quivering in his speech, from the same cause. &lsquo;Ha! ha! you will be
      amused with this <i>fellow&rsquo;s</i> audacity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Terrible emphasis was laid upon &lsquo;thing&rsquo; and &lsquo;fellow&rsquo;; and the faces of
      both editors began to glow with defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The ribaldry of this miserable man is despicably disgusting,&rsquo; said Pott,
      pretending to address Bob Sawyer, and scowling upon Slurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, Mr. Slurk laughed very heartily, and folding up the paper so as to
      get at a fresh column conveniently, said, that the blockhead really amused
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What an impudent blunderer this fellow is,&rsquo; said Pott, turning from pink
      to crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you ever read any of this man&rsquo;s foolery, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Slurk of Bob
      Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; replied Bob; &lsquo;is it very bad?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, shocking! shocking!&rsquo; rejoined Slurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really! Dear me, this is too atrocious!&rsquo; exclaimed Pott, at this
      juncture; still feigning to be absorbed in his reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you can wade through a few sentences of malice, meanness, falsehood,
      perjury, treachery, and cant,&rsquo; said Slurk, handing the paper to Bob, &lsquo;you
      will, perhaps, be somewhat repaid by a laugh at the style of this
      ungrammatical twaddler.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that you said, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pott, looking up, trembling all
      over with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that to you, sir?&rsquo; replied Slurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ungrammatical twaddler, was it, sir?&rsquo; said Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir, it was,&rsquo; replied Slurk; &lsquo;and <i>blue bore</i>, Sir, if you like
      that better; ha! ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pott retorted not a word at this jocose insult, but deliberately
      folded up his copy of the <i>Independent</i>, flattened it carefully down,
      crushed it beneath his boot, spat upon it with great ceremony, and flung
      it into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, sir,&rsquo; said Pott, retreating from the stove, &lsquo;and that&rsquo;s the way I
      would serve the viper who produces it, if I were not, fortunately for him,
      restrained by the laws of my country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serve him so, sir!&rsquo; cried Slurk, starting up. &lsquo;Those laws shall never be
      appealed to by him, sir, in such a case. Serve him so, sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear! hear!&rsquo; said Bob Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing can be fairer,&rsquo; observed Mr. Ben Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serve him so, sir!&rsquo; reiterated Slurk, in a loud voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pott darted a look of contempt, which might have withered an anchor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serve him so, sir!&rsquo; reiterated Slurk, in a louder voice than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Pott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you won&rsquo;t, won&rsquo;t you, sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Slurk, in a taunting manner;
      &lsquo;you hear this, gentlemen! He won&rsquo;t; not that he&rsquo;s afraid&mdash;, oh, no!
      he <i>won&rsquo;t</i>. Ha! ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I consider you, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pott, moved by this sarcasm, &lsquo;I consider
      you a viper. I look upon you, sir, as a man who has placed himself beyond
      the pale of society, by his most audacious, disgraceful, and abominable
      public conduct. I view you, sir, personally and politically, in no other
      light than as a most unparalleled and unmitigated viper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The indignant Independent did not wait to hear the end of this personal
      denunciation; for, catching up his carpet-bag, which was well stuffed with
      movables, he swung it in the air as Pott turned away, and, letting it fall
      with a circular sweep on his head, just at that particular angle of the
      bag where a good thick hairbrush happened to be packed, caused a sharp
      crash to be heard throughout the kitchen, and brought him at once to the
      ground.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/20432m.jpg" alt="20432m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20432.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; cried Mr. Pickwick, as Pott started up and seized the
      fire-shovel&mdash;&lsquo;gentlemen! Consider, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake&mdash;help&mdash;Sam&mdash;here&mdash;pray,
      gentlemen&mdash;interfere, somebody.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Uttering these incoherent exclamations, Mr. Pickwick rushed between the
      infuriated combatants just in time to receive the carpet-bag on one side
      of his body, and the fire-shovel on the other. Whether the representatives
      of the public feeling of Eatanswill were blinded by animosity, or (being
      both acute reasoners) saw the advantage of having a third party between
      them to bear all the blows, certain it is that they paid not the slightest
      attention to Mr. Pickwick, but defying each other with great spirit, plied
      the carpet-bag and the fire-shovel most fearlessly. Mr. Pickwick would
      unquestionably have suffered severely for his humane interference, if Mr.
      Weller, attracted by his master&rsquo;s cries, had not rushed in at the moment,
      and, snatching up a meal-sack, effectually stopped the conflict by drawing
      it over the head and shoulders of the mighty Pott, and clasping him tight
      round the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take away that &lsquo;ere bag from the t&rsquo;other madman,&rsquo; said Sam to Ben Allen
      and Bob Sawyer, who had done nothing but dodge round the group, each with
      a tortoise-shell lancet in his hand, ready to bleed the first man stunned.
      &lsquo;Give it up, you wretched little creetur, or I&rsquo;ll smother you in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Awed by these threats, and quite out of breath, the <i>Independent</i>
      suffered himself to be disarmed; and Mr. Weller, removing the extinguisher
      from Pott, set him free with a caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You take yourselves off to bed quietly,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;or I&rsquo;ll put you both
      in it, and let you fight it out vith the mouth tied, as I vould a dozen
      sich, if they played these games. And you have the goodness to come this
      here way, sir, if you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus addressing his master, Sam took him by the arm, and led him off,
      while the rival editors were severally removed to their beds by the
      landlord, under the inspection of Mr. Bob Sawyer and Mr. Benjamin Allen;
      breathing, as they went away, many sanguinary threats, and making vague
      appointments for mortal combat next day. When they came to think it over,
      however, it occurred to them that they could do it much better in print,
      so they recommenced deadly hostilities without delay; and all Eatanswill
      rung with their boldness&mdash;on paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had taken themselves off in separate coaches, early next morning,
      before the other travellers were stirring; and the weather having now
      cleared up, the chaise companions once more turned their faces to London.

      CHAPTER LII. INVOLVING A SERIOUS CHANGE IN THE WELLER FAMILY, AND THE
      UNTIMELY DOWNFALL OF MR. STIGGINS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>onsidering it a
      matter of delicacy to abstain from introducing either Bob Sawyer or Ben
      Allen to the young couple, until they were fully prepared to expect them,
      and wishing to spare Arabella&rsquo;s feelings as much as possible, Mr. Pickwick
      proposed that he and Sam should alight in the neighbourhood of the George
      and Vulture, and that the two young men should for the present take up
      their quarters elsewhere. To this they very readily agreed, and the
      proposition was accordingly acted upon; Mr. Ben Allen and Mr. Bob Sawyer
      betaking themselves to a sequestered pot-shop on the remotest confines of
      the Borough, behind the bar door of which their names had in other days
      very often appeared at the head of long and complex calculations worked in
      white chalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said the pretty housemaid, meeting Sam at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear <i>me</i> I vish it vos, my dear,&rsquo; replied Sam, dropping behind, to
      let his master get out of hearing. &lsquo;Wot a sweet-lookin&rsquo; creetur you are,
      Mary!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor&rsquo;, Mr. Weller, what nonsense you do talk!&rsquo; said Mary. &lsquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t, Mr.
      Weller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t what, my dear?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, that,&rsquo; replied the pretty housemaid. &lsquo;Lor, do get along with you.&rsquo; 
      Thus admonishing him, the pretty housemaid pushed Sam against the wall,
      declaring that he had tumbled her cap, and put her hair quite out of curl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And prevented what I was going to say, besides,&rsquo; added Mary. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a
      letter been waiting here for you four days; you hadn&rsquo;t gone away, half an
      hour, when it came; and more than that, it&rsquo;s got &ldquo;immediate,&rdquo; on the
      outside.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vere is it, my love?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I took care of it, for you, or I dare say it would have been lost long
      before this,&rsquo; replied Mary. &lsquo;There, take it; it&rsquo;s more than you deserve.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, after many pretty little coquettish doubts and fears,
      and wishes that she might not have lost it, Mary produced the letter from
      behind the nicest little muslin tucker possible, and handed it to Sam, who
      thereupon kissed it with much gallantry and devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My goodness me!&rsquo; said Mary, adjusting the tucker, and feigning
      unconsciousness, &lsquo;you seem to have grown very fond of it all at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Mr. Weller only replied by a wink, the intense meaning of which no
      description could convey the faintest idea of; and, sitting himself down
      beside Mary on a window-seat, opened the letter and glanced at the
      contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo!&rsquo; exclaimed Sam, &lsquo;wot&rsquo;s all this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing the matter, I hope?&rsquo; said Mary, peeping over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless them eyes o&rsquo; yourn!&rsquo; said Sam, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind my eyes; you had much better read your letter,&rsquo; said the
      pretty housemaid; and as she said so, she made the eyes twinkle with such
      slyness and beauty that they were perfectly irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam refreshed himself with a kiss, and read as follows:&mdash;

    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot a incomprehensible letter,&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;who&rsquo;s to know wot it means,
      vith all this he-ing and I-ing! It ain&rsquo;t my father&rsquo;s writin&rsquo;, &lsquo;cept this
      here signater in print letters; that&rsquo;s his.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps he got somebody to write it for him, and signed it himself
      afterwards,&rsquo; said the pretty housemaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop a minit,&rsquo; replied Sam, running over the letter again, and pausing
      here and there, to reflect, as he did so. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it. The gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n as
      wrote it wos a-tellin&rsquo; all about the misfortun&rsquo; in a proper vay, and then
      my father comes a-lookin&rsquo; over him, and complicates the whole concern by

      right, Mary, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having satisfied himself on this point, Sam read the letter all over, once
      more, and, appearing to form a clear notion of its contents for the first
      time, ejaculated thoughtfully, as he folded it up&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so the poor creetur&rsquo;s dead! I&rsquo;m sorry for it. She warn&rsquo;t a
      bad-disposed &lsquo;ooman, if them shepherds had let her alone. I&rsquo;m wery sorry
      for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller uttered these words in so serious a manner, that the pretty
      housemaid cast down her eyes and looked very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hows&rsquo;ever,&rsquo; said Sam, putting the letter in his pocket with a gentle
      sigh, &lsquo;it wos to be&mdash;and wos, as the old lady said arter she&rsquo;d
      married the footman. Can&rsquo;t be helped now, can it, Mary?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary shook her head, and sighed too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must apply to the hemperor for leave of absence,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary sighed again&mdash;the letter was so very affecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye!&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye,&rsquo; rejoined the pretty housemaid, turning her head away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, shake hands, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pretty housemaid put out a hand which, although it was a housemaid&rsquo;s,
      was a very small one, and rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t be wery long avay,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re always away,&rsquo; said Mary, giving her head the slightest possible
      toss in the air. &lsquo;You no sooner come, Mr. Weller, than you go again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller drew the household beauty closer to him, and entered upon a
      whispering conversation, which had not proceeded far, when she turned her
      face round and condescended to look at him again. When they parted, it was
      somehow or other indispensably necessary for her to go to her room, and
      arrange the cap and curls before she could think of presenting herself to
      her mistress; which preparatory ceremony she went off to perform,
      bestowing many nods and smiles on Sam over the banisters as she tripped
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t be avay more than a day, or two, Sir, at the furthest,&rsquo; said
      Sam, when he had communicated to Mr. Pickwick the intelligence of his
      father&rsquo;s loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As long as may be necessary, Sam,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;you have my
      full permission to remain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will tell your father, Sam, that if I can be of any assistance to him
      in his present situation, I shall be most willing and ready to lend him
      any aid in my power,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Sam. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll mention it, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And with some expressions of mutual good-will and interest, master and man
      separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just seven o&rsquo;clock when Samuel Weller, alighting from the box of a
      stage-coach which passed through Dorking, stood within a few hundred yards
      of the Marquis of Granby. It was a cold, dull evening; the little street
      looked dreary and dismal; and the mahogany countenance of the noble and
      gallant marquis seemed to wear a more sad and melancholy expression than
      it was wont to do, as it swung to and fro, creaking mournfully in the
      wind. The blinds were pulled down, and the shutters partly closed; of the
      knot of loungers that usually collected about the door, not one was to be
      seen; the place was silent and desolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing nobody of whom he could ask any preliminary questions, Sam walked
      softly in, and glancing round, he quickly recognised his parent in the
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widower was seated at a small round table in the little room behind
      the bar, smoking a pipe, with his eyes intently fixed upon the fire. The
      funeral had evidently taken place that day, for attached to his hat, which
      he still retained on his head, was a hatband measuring about a yard and a
      half in length, which hung over the top rail of the chair and streamed
      negligently down. Mr. Weller was in a very abstracted and contemplative
      mood. Notwithstanding that Sam called him by name several times, he still
      continued to smoke with the same fixed and quiet countenance, and was only
      roused ultimately by his son&rsquo;s placing the palm of his hand on his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re welcome.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been a-callin&rsquo; to you half a dozen times,&rsquo; said Sam, hanging his hat
      on a peg, &lsquo;but you didn&rsquo;t hear me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Sammy,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, again looking thoughtfully at the fire.
      &lsquo;I was in a referee, Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot about?&rsquo; inquired Sam, drawing his chair up to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In a referee, Sammy,&rsquo; replied the elder Mr. Weller, &lsquo;regarding <i>her</i>,
      Samivel.&rsquo; Here Mr. Weller jerked his head in the direction of Dorking
      churchyard, in mute explanation that his words referred to the late Mrs.
      Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wos a-thinkin&rsquo;, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, eyeing his son, with great
      earnestness, over his pipe, as if to assure him that however extraordinary
      and incredible the declaration might appear, it was nevertheless calmly
      and deliberately uttered. &lsquo;I wos a-thinkin&rsquo;, Sammy, that upon the whole I
      wos wery sorry she wos gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell, and so you ought to be,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller nodded his acquiescence in the sentiment, and again fastening
      his eyes on the fire, shrouded himself in a cloud, and mused deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those wos wery sensible observations as she made, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Weller, driving the smoke away with his hand, after a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot observations?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Them as she made, arter she was took ill,&rsquo; replied the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot was they?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Somethin&rsquo; to this here effect. &ldquo;Veller,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeered I&rsquo;ve not
      done by you quite wot I ought to have done; you&rsquo;re a wery kind-hearted
      man, and I might ha&rsquo; made your home more comfortabler. I begin to see
      now,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;ven it&rsquo;s too late, that if a married &lsquo;ooman vishes to be
      religious, she should begin vith dischargin&rsquo; her dooties at home, and
      makin&rsquo; them as is about her cheerful and happy, and that vile she goes to
      church, or chapel, or wot not, at all proper times, she should be wery
      careful not to con-wert this sort o&rsquo; thing into a excuse for idleness or
      self-indulgence. I have done this,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve vasted time and
      substance on them as has done it more than me; but I hope ven I&rsquo;m gone,
      Veller, that you&rsquo;ll think on me as I wos afore I know&rsquo;d them people, and
      as I raly wos by natur.&rdquo; &lsquo;&ldquo;Susan,&rdquo; says I&mdash;I wos took up wery short
      by this, Samivel; I von&rsquo;t deny it, my boy&mdash;&ldquo;Susan,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
      been a wery good vife to me, altogether; don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; at all about
      it; keep a good heart, my dear; and you&rsquo;ll live to see me punch that &lsquo;ere
      Stiggins&rsquo;s head yet.&rdquo; She smiled at this, Samivel,&rsquo; said the old
      gentleman, stifling a sigh with his pipe, &lsquo;but she died arter all!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell,&rsquo; said Sam, venturing to offer a little homely consolation, after
      the lapse of three or four minutes, consumed by the old gentleman in
      slowly shaking his head from side to side, and solemnly smoking, &lsquo;vell,
      gov&rsquo;nor, ve must all come to it, one day or another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So we must, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller the elder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a Providence in it all,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O&rsquo; course there is,&rsquo; replied his father, with a nod of grave approval.
      &lsquo;Wot &lsquo;ud become of the undertakers vithout it, Sammy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lost in the immense field of conjecture opened by this reflection, the
      elder Mr. Weller laid his pipe on the table, and stirred the fire with a
      meditative visage.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the old gentleman was thus engaged, a very buxom-looking cook,
      dressed in mourning, who had been bustling about, in the bar, glided into
      the room, and bestowing many smirks of recognition upon Sam, silently
      stationed herself at the back of his father&rsquo;s chair, and announced her
      presence by a slight cough, the which, being disregarded, was followed by
      a louder one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo!&rsquo; said the elder Mr. Weller, dropping the poker as he looked round,
      and hastily drew his chair away. &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s the matter now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have a cup of tea, there&rsquo;s a good soul,&rsquo; replied the buxom female
      coaxingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I von&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, in a somewhat boisterous manner. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see
      you&mdash;&rsquo; Mr. Weller hastily checked himself, and added in a low tone,
      &lsquo;furder fust.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, dear, dear! How adwersity does change people!&rsquo; said the lady, looking
      upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the only thing &lsquo;twixt this and the doctor as shall change my
      condition,&rsquo; muttered Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really never saw a man so cross,&rsquo; said the buxom female.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind. It&rsquo;s all for my own good; vich is the reflection vith vich
      the penitent school-boy comforted his feelin&rsquo;s ven they flogged him,&rsquo; 
      rejoined the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The buxom female shook her head with a compassionate and sympathising air;
      and, appealing to Sam, inquired whether his father really ought not to
      make an effort to keep up, and not give way to that lowness of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see, Mr. Samuel,&rsquo; said the buxom female, &lsquo;as I was telling him
      yesterday, he will feel lonely, he can&rsquo;t expect but what he should, sir,
      but he should keep up a good heart, because, dear me, I&rsquo;m sure we all pity
      his loss, and are ready to do anything for him; and there&rsquo;s no situation
      in life so bad, Mr. Samuel, that it can&rsquo;t be mended. Which is what a very
      worthy person said to me when my husband died.&rsquo; Here the speaker, putting
      her hand before her mouth, coughed again, and looked affectionately at the
      elder Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As I don&rsquo;t rekvire any o&rsquo; your conversation just now, mum, vill you have
      the goodness to re-tire?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller, in a grave and steady
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said the buxom female, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I only spoke to you
      out of kindness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery likely, mum,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Samivel, show the lady out, and
      shut the door after her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This hint was not lost upon the buxom female; for she at once left the
      room, and slammed the door behind her, upon which Mr. Weller, senior,
      falling back in his chair in a violent perspiration, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sammy, if I wos to stop here alone vun week&mdash;only vun week, my boy&mdash;that
      &lsquo;ere &lsquo;ooman &lsquo;ud marry me by force and wiolence afore it was over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot! is she so wery fond on you?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fond!&rsquo; replied his father. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t keep her avay from me. If I was
      locked up in a fireproof chest vith a patent Brahmin, she&rsquo;d find means to
      get at me, Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot a thing it is to be so sought arter!&rsquo; observed Sam, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t take no pride out on it, Sammy,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, poking the
      fire vehemently, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a horrid sitiwation. I&rsquo;m actiwally drove out o&rsquo; 
      house and home by it. The breath was scarcely out o&rsquo; your poor
      mother-in-law&rsquo;s body, ven vun old &lsquo;ooman sends me a pot o&rsquo; jam, and
      another a pot o&rsquo; jelly, and another brews a blessed large jug o&rsquo; 
      camomile-tea, vich she brings in vith her own hands.&rsquo; Mr. Weller paused
      with an aspect of intense disgust, and looking round, added in a whisper,
      &lsquo;They wos all widders, Sammy, all on &lsquo;em, &lsquo;cept the camomile-tea vun, as
      wos a single young lady o&rsquo; fifty-three.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam gave a comical look in reply, and the old gentleman having broken an
      obstinate lump of coal, with a countenance expressive of as much
      earnestness and malice as if it had been the head of one of the widows
      last-mentioned, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In short, Sammy, I feel that I ain&rsquo;t safe anyveres but on the box.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How are you safer there than anyveres else?&rsquo; interrupted Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Cos a coachman&rsquo;s a privileged indiwidual,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, looking
      fixedly at his son. &lsquo;&rsquo;Cos a coachman may do vithout suspicion wot other
      men may not; &lsquo;cos a coachman may be on the wery amicablest terms with
      eighty mile o&rsquo; females, and yet nobody think that he ever means to marry
      any vun among &lsquo;em. And wot other man can say the same, Sammy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell, there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; in that,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If your gov&rsquo;nor had been a coachman,&rsquo; reasoned Mr. Weller, &lsquo;do you s&rsquo;pose
      as that &lsquo;ere jury &lsquo;ud ever ha&rsquo; conwicted him, s&rsquo;posin&rsquo; it possible as the
      matter could ha&rsquo; gone to that extremity? They dustn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; done it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wy not?&rsquo; said Sam, rather disparagingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wy not!&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Weller; &lsquo;&rsquo;cos it &lsquo;ud ha&rsquo; gone agin their
      consciences. A reg&rsquo;lar coachman&rsquo;s a sort o&rsquo; con-nectin&rsquo; link betwixt
      singleness and matrimony, and every practicable man knows it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot! You mean, they&rsquo;re gen&rsquo;ral favorites, and nobody takes adwantage on
      &lsquo;em, p&rsquo;raps?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How it ever come to that &lsquo;ere pass,&rsquo; resumed the parent Weller, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
      say. Wy it is that long-stage coachmen possess such insiniwations, and is
      alvays looked up to&mdash;a-dored I may say&mdash;by ev&rsquo;ry young &lsquo;ooman in
      ev&rsquo;ry town he vurks through, I don&rsquo;t know. I only know that so it is. It&rsquo;s
      a regulation of natur&mdash;a dispensary, as your poor mother-in-law used
      to say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A dispensation,&rsquo; said Sam, correcting the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good, Samivel, a dispensation if you like it better,&rsquo; returned Mr.
      Weller; &lsquo;I call it a dispensary, and it&rsquo;s always writ up so, at the places
      vere they gives you physic for nothin&rsquo; in your own bottles; that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Mr. Weller refilled and relighted his pipe, and once
      more summoning up a meditative expression of countenance, continued as
      follows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Therefore, my boy, as I do not see the adwisability o&rsquo; stoppin here to be
      married vether I vant to or not, and as at the same time I do not vish to
      separate myself from them interestin&rsquo; members o&rsquo; society altogether, I
      have come to the determination o&rsquo; driving the Safety, and puttin&rsquo; up vunce
      more at the Bell Savage, vich is my nat&rsquo;ral born element, Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And wot&rsquo;s to become o&rsquo; the bis&rsquo;ness?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The bis&rsquo;ness, Samivel,&rsquo; replied the old gentleman, &lsquo;good-vill, stock, and
      fixters, vill be sold by private contract; and out o&rsquo; the money, two
      hundred pound, agreeable to a rekvest o&rsquo; your mother-in-law&rsquo;s to me, a
      little afore she died, vill be invested in your name in&mdash;What do you
      call them things agin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot things?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Them things as is always a-goin&rsquo; up and down, in the city.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Omnibuses?&rsquo; suggested Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Them things as is alvays a-fluctooatin&rsquo;,
      and gettin&rsquo; theirselves inwolved somehow or another vith the national
      debt, and the chequers bill; and all that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! the funds,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Weller, &lsquo;the funs; two hundred pounds o&rsquo; the money is
      to be inwested for you, Samivel, in the funs; four and a half per cent.
      reduced counsels, Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery kind o&rsquo; the old lady to think o&rsquo; me,&rsquo; said Sam, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m wery much
      obliged to her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The rest will be inwested in my name,&rsquo; continued the elder Mr. Weller;
      &lsquo;and wen I&rsquo;m took off the road, it&rsquo;ll come to you, so take care you don&rsquo;t
      spend it all at vunst, my boy, and mind that no widder gets a inklin&rsquo; o&rsquo; 
      your fortun&rsquo;, or you&rsquo;re done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having delivered this warning, Mr. Weller resumed his pipe with a more
      serene countenance; the disclosure of these matters appearing to have
      eased his mind considerably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Somebody&rsquo;s a-tappin&rsquo; at the door,&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let &lsquo;em tap,&rsquo; replied his father, with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam acted upon the direction. There was another tap, and another, and then
      a long row of taps; upon which Sam inquired why the tapper was not
      admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush,&rsquo; whispered Mr. Weller, with apprehensive looks, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t take no
      notice on &lsquo;em, Sammy, it&rsquo;s vun o&rsquo; the widders, p&rsquo;raps.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No notice being taken of the taps, the unseen visitor, after a short
      lapse, ventured to open the door and peep in. It was no female head that
      was thrust in at the partially-opened door, but the long black locks and
      red face of Mr. Stiggins. Mr. Weller&rsquo;s pipe fell from his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reverend gentleman gradually opened the door by almost imperceptible
      degrees, until the aperture was just wide enough to admit of the passage
      of his lank body, when he glided into the room and closed it after him,
      with great care and gentleness. Turning towards Sam, and raising his hands
      and eyes in token of the unspeakable sorrow with which he regarded the
      calamity that had befallen the family, he carried the high-backed chair to
      his old corner by the fire, and, seating himself on the very edge, drew
      forth a brown pocket-handkerchief, and applied the same to his optics.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was going forward, the elder Mr. Weller sat back in his chair,
      with his eyes wide open, his hands planted on his knees, and his whole
      countenance expressive of absorbing and overwhelming astonishment. Sam sat
      opposite him in perfect silence, waiting, with eager curiosity, for the
      termination of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stiggins kept the brown pocket-handkerchief before his eyes for some
      minutes, moaning decently meanwhile, and then, mastering his feelings by a
      strong effort, put it in his pocket and buttoned it up. After this, he
      stirred the fire; after that, he rubbed his hands and looked at Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, my young friend,&rsquo; said Mr. Stiggins, breaking the silence, in a very
      low voice, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s a sorrowful affliction!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam nodded very slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For the man of wrath, too!&rsquo; added Mr. Stiggins; &lsquo;it makes a vessel&rsquo;s
      heart bleed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller was overheard by his son to murmur something relative to making
      a vessel&rsquo;s nose bleed; but Mr. Stiggins heard him not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know, young man,&rsquo; whispered Mr. Stiggins, drawing his chair closer
      to Sam, &lsquo;whether she has left Emanuel anything?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The chapel,&rsquo; replied Mr. Stiggins; &lsquo;our chapel; our fold, Mr. Samuel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She hasn&rsquo;t left the fold nothin&rsquo;, nor the shepherd nothin&rsquo;, nor the
      animals nothin&rsquo;,&rsquo; said Sam decisively; &lsquo;nor the dogs neither.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stiggins looked slily at Sam; glanced at the old gentleman, who was
      sitting with his eyes closed, as if asleep; and drawing his chair still
      nearer, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing for <i>me</i>, Mr. Samuel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think there&rsquo;s something,&rsquo; said Stiggins, turning as pale as he could
      turn. &lsquo;Consider, Mr. Samuel; no little token?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not so much as the vorth o&rsquo; that &lsquo;ere old umberella o&rsquo; yourn,&rsquo; replied
      Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said Mr. Stiggins hesitatingly, after a few moments&rsquo; deep
      thought, &lsquo;perhaps she recommended me to the care of the man of wrath, Mr.
      Samuel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think that&rsquo;s wery likely, from what he said,&rsquo; rejoined Sam; &lsquo;he wos
      a-speakin&rsquo; about you, jist now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was he, though?&rsquo; exclaimed Stiggins, brightening up. &lsquo;Ah! He&rsquo;s changed, I
      dare say. We might live very comfortably together now, Mr. Samuel, eh? I
      could take care of his property when you are away&mdash;good care, you
      see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaving a long-drawn sigh, Mr. Stiggins paused for a response. Sam nodded,
      and Mr. Weller the elder gave vent to an extraordinary sound, which, being
      neither a groan, nor a grunt, nor a gasp, nor a growl, seemed to partake
      in some degree of the character of all four.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stiggins, encouraged by this sound, which he understood to betoken
      remorse or repentance, looked about him, rubbed his hands, wept, smiled,
      wept again, and then, walking softly across the room to a well-remembered
      shelf in one corner, took down a tumbler, and with great deliberation put
      four lumps of sugar in it. Having got thus far, he looked about him again,
      and sighed grievously; with that, he walked softly into the bar, and
      presently returning with the tumbler half full of pine-apple rum, advanced
      to the kettle which was singing gaily on the hob, mixed his grog, stirred
      it, sipped it, sat down, and taking a long and hearty pull at the
      rum-and-water, stopped for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Mr. Weller, who still continued to make various strange and
      uncouth attempts to appear asleep, offered not a single word during these
      proceedings; but when Stiggins stopped for breath, he darted upon him, and
      snatching the tumbler from his hand, threw the remainder of the
      rum-and-water in his face, and the glass itself into the grate. Then,
      seizing the reverend gentleman firmly by the collar, he suddenly fell to
      kicking him most furiously, accompanying every application of his top-boot
      to Mr. Stiggins&rsquo;s person, with sundry violent and incoherent anathemas
      upon his limbs, eyes, and body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, &lsquo;put my hat on tight for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam dutifully adjusted the hat with the long hatband more firmly on his
      father&rsquo;s head, and the old gentleman, resuming his kicking with greater
      agility than before, tumbled with Mr. Stiggins through the bar, and
      through the passage, out at the front door, and so into the street&mdash;the
      kicking continuing the whole way, and increasing in vehemence, rather than
      diminishing, every time the top-boot was lifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful and exhilarating sight to see the red-nosed man
      writhing in Mr. Weller&rsquo;s grasp, and his whole frame quivering with anguish
      as kick followed kick in rapid succession; it was a still more exciting
      spectacle to behold Mr. Weller, after a powerful struggle, immersing Mr.
      Stiggins&rsquo;s head in a horse-trough full of water, and holding it there,
      until he was half suffocated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, throwing all his energy into one most
      complicated kick, as he at length permitted Mr. Stiggins to withdraw his
      head from the trough, &lsquo;send any vun o&rsquo; them lazy shepherds here, and I&rsquo;ll
      pound him to a jelly first, and drownd him artervards! Sammy, help me in,
      and fill me a small glass of brandy. I&rsquo;m out o&rsquo; breath, my boy.&rsquo;

      CHAPTER LIII. COMPRISING THE FINAL EXIT OF MR. JINGLE AND JOB TROTTER,
      WITH A GREAT MORNING OF BUSINESS IN GRAY&rsquo;S INN SQUARE&mdash;CONCLUDING
      WITH A DOUBLE KNOCK AT MR. PERKER&rsquo;S DOOR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Arabella,
      after some gentle preparation and many assurances that there was not the
      least occasion for being low-spirited, was at length made acquainted by
      Mr. Pickwick with the unsatisfactory result of his visit to Birmingham,
      she burst into tears, and sobbing aloud, lamented in moving terms that she
      should have been the unhappy cause of any estrangement between a father
      and his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear girl,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick kindly, &lsquo;it is no fault of yours. It was
      impossible to foresee that the old gentleman would be so strongly
      prepossessed against his son&rsquo;s marriage, you know. I am sure,&rsquo; added Mr.
      Pickwick, glancing at her pretty face, &lsquo;he can have very little idea of
      the pleasure he denies himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, my dear Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Arabella, &lsquo;what shall we do, if he
      continues to be angry with us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, wait patiently, my dear, until he thinks better of it,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Pickwick cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, dear Mr. Pickwick, what is to become of Nathaniel if his father
      withdraws his assistance?&rsquo; urged Arabella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that case, my love,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I will venture to
      prophesy that he will find some other friend who will not be backward in
      helping him to start in the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The significance of this reply was not so well disguised by Mr. Pickwick
      but that Arabella understood it. So, throwing her arms round his neck, and
      kissing him affectionately, she sobbed louder than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick taking her hand, &lsquo;we will wait here a few
      days longer, and see whether he writes or takes any other notice of your
      husband&rsquo;s communication. If not, I have thought of half a dozen plans, any
      one of which would make you happy at once. There, my dear, there!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Mr. Pickwick gently pressed Arabella&rsquo;s hand, and bade
      her dry her eyes, and not distress her husband. Upon which, Arabella, who
      was one of the best little creatures alive, put her handkerchief in her
      reticule, and by the time Mr. Winkle joined them, exhibited in full lustre
      the same beaming smiles and sparkling eyes that had originally captivated
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is a distressing predicament for these young people,&rsquo; thought Mr.
      Pickwick, as he dressed himself next morning. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll walk up to Perker&rsquo;s,
      and consult him about the matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Pickwick was further prompted to betake himself to Gray&rsquo;s Inn
      Square by an anxious desire to come to a pecuniary settlement with the
      kind-hearted little attorney without further delay, he made a hurried
      breakfast, and executed his intention so speedily, that ten o&rsquo;clock had
      not struck when he reached Gray&rsquo;s Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It still wanted ten minutes to the hour when he had ascended the staircase
      on which Perker&rsquo;s chambers were. The clerks had not arrived yet, and he
      beguiled the time by looking out of the staircase window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The healthy light of a fine October morning made even the dingy old houses
      brighten up a little; some of the dusty windows actually looking almost
      cheerful as the sun&rsquo;s rays gleamed upon them. Clerk after clerk hastened
      into the square by one or other of the entrances, and looking up at the
      Hall clock, accelerated or decreased his rate of walking according to the
      time at which his office hours nominally commenced; the half-past nine
      o&rsquo;clock people suddenly becoming very brisk, and the ten o&rsquo;clock gentlemen
      falling into a pace of most aristocratic slowness. The clock struck ten,
      and clerks poured in faster than ever, each one in a greater perspiration
      than his predecessor. The noise of unlocking and opening doors echoed and
      re-echoed on every side; heads appeared as if by magic in every window;
      the porters took up their stations for the day; the slipshod laundresses
      hurried off; the postman ran from house to house; and the whole legal hive
      was in a bustle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re early, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said a voice behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Mr. Lowten,&rsquo; replied that gentleman, looking round, and recognising
      his old acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Precious warm walking, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; said Lowten, drawing a Bramah key from
      his pocket, with a small plug therein, to keep the dust out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You appear to feel it so,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick, smiling at the clerk,
      who was literally red-hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve come along, rather, I can tell you,&rsquo; replied Lowten. &lsquo;It went the
      half hour as I came through the Polygon. I&rsquo;m here before him, though, so I
      don&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Comforting himself with this reflection, Mr. Lowten extracted the plug
      from the door-key; having opened the door, replugged and repocketed his
      Bramah, and picked up the letters which the postman had dropped through
      the box, he ushered Mr. Pickwick into the office. Here, in the twinkling
      of an eye, he divested himself of his coat, put on a threadbare garment,
      which he took out of a desk, hung up his hat, pulled forth a few sheets of
      cartridge and blotting-paper in alternate layers, and, sticking a pen
      behind his ear, rubbed his hands with an air of great satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, you see, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;now I&rsquo;m complete. I&rsquo;ve got my
      office coat on, and my pad out, and let him come as soon as he likes. You
      haven&rsquo;t got a pinch of snuff about you, have you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I have not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for it,&rsquo; said Lowten. &lsquo;Never mind. I&rsquo;ll run out presently, and
      get a bottle of soda. Don&rsquo;t I look rather queer about the eyes, Mr.
      Pickwick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The individual appealed to, surveyed Mr. Lowten&rsquo;s eyes from a distance,
      and expressed his opinion that no unusual queerness was perceptible in
      those features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it,&rsquo; said Lowten. &lsquo;We were keeping it up pretty tolerably at
      the Stump last night, and I&rsquo;m rather out of sorts this morning. Perker&rsquo;s
      been about that business of yours, by the bye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What business?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s costs?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t mean that,&rsquo; replied Mr. Lowten. &lsquo;About getting that customer
      that we paid the ten shillings in the pound to the bill-discounter for, on
      your account&mdash;to get him out of the Fleet, you know&mdash;about
      getting him to Demerara.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Mr. Jingle,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick hastily. &lsquo;Yes. Well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all arranged,&rsquo; said Lowten, mending his pen. &lsquo;The agent at
      Liverpool said he had been obliged to you many times when you were in
      business, and he would be glad to take him on your recommendation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s well,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;I am delighted to hear it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I say,&rsquo; resumed Lowten, scraping the back of the pen preparatory to
      making a fresh split, &lsquo;what a soft chap that other is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which other?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, that servant, or friend, or whatever he is; you know, Trotter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with a smile. &lsquo;I always thought him the reverse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and so did I, from what little I saw of him,&rsquo; replied Lowten, &lsquo;it
      only shows how one may be deceived. What do you think of his going to
      Demerara, too?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! And giving up what was offered him here!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Treating Perker&rsquo;s offer of eighteen bob a week, and a rise if he behaved
      himself, like dirt,&rsquo; replied Lowten. &lsquo;He said he must go along with the
      other one, and so they persuaded Perker to write again, and they&rsquo;ve got
      him something on the same estate; not near so good, Perker says, as a
      convict would get in New South Wales, if he appeared at his trial in a new
      suit of clothes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Foolish fellow,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with glistening eyes. &lsquo;Foolish
      fellow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s worse than foolish; it&rsquo;s downright sneaking, you know,&rsquo; replied
      Lowten, nibbing the pen with a contemptuous face. &lsquo;He says that he&rsquo;s the
      only friend he ever had, and he&rsquo;s attached to him, and all that.
      Friendship&rsquo;s a very good thing in its way&mdash;we are all very friendly
      and comfortable at the Stump, for instance, over our grog, where every man
      pays for himself; but damn hurting yourself for anybody else, you know! No
      man should have more than two attachments&mdash;the first, to number one,
      and the second to the ladies; that&rsquo;s what I say&mdash;ha! ha!&rsquo; Mr. Lowten
      concluded with a loud laugh, half in jocularity, and half in derision,
      which was prematurely cut short by the sound of Perker&rsquo;s footsteps on the
      stairs, at the first approach of which, he vaulted on his stool with an
      agility most remarkable, and wrote intensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greeting between Mr. Pickwick and his professional adviser was warm
      and cordial; the client was scarcely ensconced in the attorney&rsquo;s
      arm-chair, however, when a knock was heard at the door, and a voice
      inquired whether Mr. Perker was within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hark!&rsquo; said Perker, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s one of our vagabond friends&mdash;Jingle
      himself, my dear Sir. Will you see him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I think you had better. Here, you Sir, what&rsquo;s your name, walk in,
      will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In compliance with this unceremonious invitation, Jingle and Job walked
      into the room, but, seeing Mr. Pickwick, stopped short in some confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Perker, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you know that gentleman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good reason to,&rsquo; replied Mr. Jingle, stepping forward. &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick&mdash;deepest
      obligations&mdash;life preserver&mdash;made a man of me&mdash;you shall
      never repent it, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am happy to hear you say so,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;You look much
      better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thanks to you, sir&mdash;great change&mdash;Majesty&rsquo;s Fleet&mdash;unwholesome
      place&mdash;very,&rsquo; said Jingle, shaking his head. He was decently and
      cleanly dressed, and so was Job, who stood bolt upright behind him,
      staring at Mr. Pickwick with a visage of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When do they go to Liverpool?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, half aside to
      Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This evening, Sir, at seven o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; said Job, taking one step forward.
      &lsquo;By the heavy coach from the city, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are your places taken?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are, sir,&rsquo; replied Job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have fully made up your mind to go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have sir,&rsquo; answered Job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With regard to such an outfit as was indispensable for Jingle,&rsquo; said
      Perker, addressing Mr. Pickwick aloud. &lsquo;I have taken upon myself to make
      an arrangement for the deduction of a small sum from his quarterly salary,
      which, being made only for one year, and regularly remitted, will provide
      for that expense. I entirely disapprove of your doing anything for him, my
      dear sir, which is not dependent on his own exertions and good conduct.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; interposed Jingle, with great firmness. &lsquo;Clear head&mdash;man
      of the world&mdash;quite right&mdash;perfectly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By compounding with his creditor, releasing his clothes from the
      pawnbroker&rsquo;s, relieving him in prison, and paying for his passage,&rsquo; 
      continued Perker, without noticing Jingle&rsquo;s observation, &lsquo;you have already
      lost upwards of fifty pounds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not lost,&rsquo; said Jingle hastily, &lsquo;Pay it all&mdash;stick to business&mdash;cash
      up&mdash;every farthing. Yellow fever, perhaps&mdash;can&rsquo;t help that&mdash;if
      not&mdash;&rsquo; Here Mr. Jingle paused, and striking the crown of his hat with
      great violence, passed his hand over his eyes, and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He means to say,&rsquo; said Job, advancing a few paces, &lsquo;that if he is not
      carried off by the fever, he will pay the money back again. If he lives,
      he will, Mr. Pickwick. I will see it done. I know he will, Sir,&rsquo; said Job,
      with energy. &lsquo;I could undertake to swear it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, who had been bestowing a score or two of
      frowns upon Perker, to stop his summary of benefits conferred, which the
      little attorney obstinately disregarded, &lsquo;you must be careful not to play
      any more desperate cricket matches, Mr. Jingle, or to renew your
      acquaintance with Sir Thomas Blazo, and I have little doubt of your
      preserving your health.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jingle smiled at this sally, but looked rather foolish
      notwithstanding; so Mr. Pickwick changed the subject by saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t happen to know, do you, what has become of another friend of
      yours&mdash;a more humble one, whom I saw at Rochester?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dismal Jemmy?&rsquo; inquired Jingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jingle shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clever rascal&mdash;queer fellow, hoaxing genius&mdash;Job&rsquo;s brother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Job&rsquo;s brother!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Well, now I look at him closely,
      there <i>is</i> a likeness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We were always considered like each other, Sir,&rsquo; said Job, with a cunning
      look just lurking in the corners of his eyes, &lsquo;only I was really of a
      serious nature, and he never was. He emigrated to America, Sir, in
      consequence of being too much sought after here, to be comfortable; and
      has never been heard of since.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That accounts for my not having received the &ldquo;page from the romance of
      real life,&rdquo; which he promised me one morning when he appeared to be
      contemplating suicide on Rochester Bridge, I suppose,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
      smiling. &lsquo;I need not inquire whether his dismal behaviour was natural or
      assumed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He could assume anything, Sir,&rsquo; said Job. &lsquo;You may consider yourself very
      fortunate in having escaped him so easily. On intimate terms he would have
      been even a more dangerous acquaintance than&mdash;&rsquo; Job looked at Jingle,
      hesitated, and finally added, &lsquo;than&mdash;than-myself even.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A hopeful family yours, Mr. Trotter,&rsquo; said Perker, sealing a letter which
      he had just finished writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Sir,&rsquo; replied Job. &lsquo;Very much so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the little man, laughing, &lsquo;I hope you are going to disgrace
      it. Deliver this letter to the agent when you reach Liverpool, and let me
      advise you, gentlemen, not to be too knowing in the West Indies. If you
      throw away this chance, you will both richly deserve to be hanged, as I
      sincerely trust you will be. And now you had better leave Mr. Pickwick and
      me alone, for we have other matters to talk over, and time is precious.&rsquo; 
      As Perker said this, he looked towards the door, with an evident desire to
      render the leave-taking as brief as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was brief enough on Mr. Jingle&rsquo;s part. He thanked the little attorney
      in a few hurried words for the kindness and promptitude with which he had
      rendered his assistance, and, turning to his benefactor, stood for a few
      seconds as if irresolute what to say or how to act. Job Trotter relieved
      his perplexity; for, with a humble and grateful bow to Mr. Pickwick, he
      took his friend gently by the arm, and led him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A worthy couple!&rsquo; said Perker, as the door closed behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope they may become so,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;What do you think? Is
      there any chance of their permanent reformation?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Perker shrugged his shoulders doubtfully, but observing Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      anxious and disappointed look, rejoined&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course there is a chance. I hope it may prove a good one. They are
      unquestionably penitent now; but then, you know, they have the
      recollection of very recent suffering fresh upon them. What they may
      become, when that fades away, is a problem that neither you nor I can
      solve. However, my dear Sir,&rsquo; added Perker, laying his hand on Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s shoulder, &lsquo;your object is equally honourable, whatever the
      result is. Whether that species of benevolence which is so very cautious
      and long-sighted that it is seldom exercised at all, lest its owner should
      be imposed upon, and so wounded in his self-love, be real charity or a
      worldly counterfeit, I leave to wiser heads than mine to determine. But if
      those two fellows were to commit a burglary to-morrow, my opinion of this
      action would be equally high.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these remarks, which were delivered in a much more animated and
      earnest manner than is usual in legal gentlemen, Perker drew his chair to
      his desk, and listened to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s recital of old Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s
      obstinacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give him a week,&rsquo; said Perker, nodding his head prophetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think he will come round?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think he will,&rsquo; rejoined Perker. &lsquo;If not, we must try the young lady&rsquo;s
      persuasion; and that is what anybody but you would have done at first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Perker was taking a pinch of snuff with various grotesque contractions
      of countenance, eulogistic of the persuasive powers appertaining unto
      young ladies, when the murmur of inquiry and answer was heard in the outer
      office, and Lowten tapped at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in!&rsquo; cried the little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk came in, and shut the door after him, with great mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; inquired Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re wanted, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who wants me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lowten looked at Mr. Pickwick, and coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who wants me? Can&rsquo;t you speak, Mr. Lowten?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, sir,&rsquo; replied Lowten, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s Dodson; and Fogg is with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless my life!&rsquo; said the little man, looking at his watch, &lsquo;I appointed
      them to be here at half-past eleven, to settle that matter of yours,
      Pickwick. I gave them an undertaking on which they sent down your
      discharge; it&rsquo;s very awkward, my dear Sir; what will you do? Would you
      like to step into the next room?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The next room being the identical room in which Messrs. Dodson &amp; Fogg
      were, Mr. Pickwick replied that he would remain where he was: the more
      especially as Messrs. Dodson &amp; Fogg ought to be ashamed to look him in
      the face, instead of his being ashamed to see them. Which latter
      circumstance he begged Mr. Perker to note, with a glowing countenance and
      many marks of indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, my dear Sir, very well,&rsquo; replied Perker, &lsquo;I can only say that
      if you expect either Dodson or Fogg to exhibit any symptom of shame or
      confusion at having to look you, or anybody else, in the face, you are the
      most sanguine man in your expectations that I ever met with. Show them in,
      Mr. Lowten.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lowten disappeared with a grin, and immediately returned ushering in
      the firm, in due form of precedence&mdash;Dodson first, and Fogg
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have seen Mr. Pickwick, I believe?&rsquo; said Perker to Dodson, inclining
      his pen in the direction where that gentleman was seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you do, Mr. Pickwick?&rsquo; said Dodson, in a loud voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; cried Fogg, &lsquo;how do you do, Mr. Pickwick? I hope you are well,
      Sir. I thought I knew the face,&rsquo; said Fogg, drawing up a chair, and
      looking round him with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick bent his head very slightly, in answer to these salutations,
      and, seeing Fogg pull a bundle of papers from his coat pocket, rose and
      walked to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no occasion for Mr. Pickwick to move, Mr. Perker,&rsquo; said Fogg,
      untying the red tape which encircled the little bundle, and smiling again
      more sweetly than before. &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick is pretty well acquainted with
      these proceedings. There are no secrets between us, I think. He! he! he!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not many, I think,&rsquo; said Dodson. &lsquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; Then both the partners
      laughed together&mdash;pleasantly and cheerfully, as men who are going to
      receive money often do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall make Mr. Pickwick pay for peeping,&rsquo; said Fogg, with considerable
      native humour, as he unfolded his papers. &lsquo;The amount of the taxed costs
      is one hundred and thirty-three, six, four, Mr. Perker.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great comparing of papers, and turning over of leaves, by Fogg
      and Perker, after this statement of profit and loss. Meanwhile, Dodson
      said, in an affable manner, to Mr. Pickwick&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you are looking quite so stout as when I had the pleasure
      of seeing you last, Mr. Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Possibly not, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, who had been flashing forth
      looks of fierce indignation, without producing the smallest effect on
      either of the sharp practitioners; &lsquo;I believe I am not, Sir. I have been
      persecuted and annoyed by scoundrels of late, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Perker coughed violently, and asked Mr. Pickwick whether he wouldn&rsquo;t like
      to look at the morning paper. To which inquiry Mr. Pickwick returned a
      most decided negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True,&rsquo; said Dodson, &lsquo;I dare say you have been annoyed in the Fleet; there
      are some odd gentry there. Whereabouts were your apartments, Mr.
      Pickwick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My one room,&rsquo; replied that much-injured gentleman, &lsquo;was on the
      coffee-room flight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, indeed!&rsquo; said Dodson. &lsquo;I believe that is a very pleasant part of the
      establishment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a coolness about all this, which, to a gentleman of an excitable
      temperament, had, under the circumstances, rather an exasperating
      tendency. Mr. Pickwick restrained his wrath by gigantic efforts; but when
      Perker wrote a cheque for the whole amount, and Fogg deposited it in a
      small pocket-book, with a triumphant smile playing over his pimply
      features, which communicated itself likewise to the stern countenance of
      Dodson, he felt the blood in his cheeks tingling with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Mr. Dodson,&rsquo; said Fogg, putting up the pocket-book and drawing on
      his gloves, &lsquo;I am at your service.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; said Dodson, rising; &lsquo;I am quite ready.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very happy,&rsquo; said Fogg, softened by the cheque, &lsquo;to have had the
      pleasure of making Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s acquaintance. I hope you don&rsquo;t think
      quite so ill of us, Mr. Pickwick, as when we first had the pleasure of
      seeing you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope not,&rsquo; said Dodson, with the high tone of calumniated virtue. &lsquo;Mr.
      Pickwick now knows us better, I trust; whatever your opinion of gentlemen
      of our profession may be, I beg to assure you, sir, that I bear no
      ill-will or vindictive feeling towards you for the sentiments you thought
      proper to express in our office in Freeman&rsquo;s Court, Cornhill, on the
      occasion to which my partner has referred.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no, no; nor I,&rsquo; said Fogg, in a most forgiving manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our conduct, Sir,&rsquo; said Dodson, &lsquo;will speak for itself, and justify
      itself, I hope, upon every occasion. We have been in the profession some
      years, Mr. Pickwick, and have been honoured with the confidence of many
      excellent clients. I wish you good-morning, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-morning, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Fogg. So saying, he put his umbrella
      under his arm, drew off his right glove, and extended the hand of
      reconciliation to that most indignant gentleman; who, thereupon, thrust
      his hands beneath his coat tails, and eyed the attorney with looks of
      scornful amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lowten!&rsquo; cried Perker, at this moment. &lsquo;Open the door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait one instant,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Perker, I <i>will </i>speak.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Sir, pray let the matter rest where it is,&rsquo; said the little
      attorney, who had been in a state of nervous apprehension during the whole
      interview; &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick, I beg&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not be put down, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick hastily. &lsquo;Mr. Dodson,
      you have addressed some remarks to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dodson turned round, bent his head meekly, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some remarks to me,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Pickwick, almost breathless; &lsquo;and your
      partner has tendered me his hand, and you have both assumed a tone of
      forgiveness and high-mindedness, which is an extent of impudence that I
      was not prepared for, even in you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, sir!&rsquo; exclaimed Dodson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, sir!&rsquo; reiterated Fogg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know that I have been the victim of your plots and conspiracies?&rsquo; 
      continued Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Do you know that I am the man whom you have been
      imprisoning and robbing? Do you know that you were the attorneys for the
      plaintiff, in Bardell and Pickwick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir, we do know it,&rsquo; replied Dodson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course we know it, Sir,&rsquo; rejoined Fogg, slapping his pocket&mdash;perhaps
      by accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see that you recollect it with satisfaction,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
      attempting to call up a sneer for the first time in his life, and failing
      most signally in so doing. &lsquo;Although I have long been anxious to tell you,
      in plain terms, what my opinion of you is, I should have let even this
      opportunity pass, in deference to my friend Perker&rsquo;s wishes, but for the
      unwarrantable tone you have assumed, and your insolent familiarity. I say
      insolent familiarity, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, turning upon Fogg with a
      fierceness of gesture which caused that person to retreat towards the door
      with great expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care, Sir,&rsquo; said Dodson, who, though he was the biggest man of the
      party, had prudently entrenched himself behind Fogg, and was speaking over
      his head with a very pale face. &lsquo;Let him assault you, Mr. Fogg; don&rsquo;t
      return it on any account.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, I won&rsquo;t return it,&rsquo; said Fogg, falling back a little more as he
      spoke; to the evident relief of his partner, who by these means was
      gradually getting into the outer office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are,&rsquo; continued Mr. Pickwick, resuming the thread of his discourse&mdash;&lsquo;you
      are a well-matched pair of mean, rascally, pettifogging robbers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; interposed Perker, &lsquo;is that all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is all summed up in that,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;they are mean,
      rascally, pettifogging robbers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; said Perker, in a most conciliatory tone. &lsquo;My dear sirs, he has
      said all he has to say. Now pray go. Lowten, is that door open?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lowten, with a distant giggle, replied in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, there&mdash;good-morning&mdash;good-morning&mdash;now pray, my
      dear sirs&mdash;Mr. Lowten, the door!&rsquo; cried the little man, pushing
      Dodson &amp; Fogg, nothing loath, out of the office; &lsquo;this way, my dear
      sirs&mdash;now pray don&rsquo;t prolong this&mdash;Dear me&mdash;Mr. Lowten&mdash;the
      door, sir&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you attend?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If there&rsquo;s law in England, sir,&rsquo; said Dodson, looking towards Mr.
      Pickwick, as he put on his hat, &lsquo;you shall smart for this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a couple of mean&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Remember, sir, you pay dearly for this,&rsquo; said Fogg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;Rascally, pettifogging robbers!&rsquo; continued Mr. Pickwick, taking
      not the least notice of the threats that were addressed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Robbers!&rsquo; cried Mr. Pickwick, running to the stair-head, as the two
      attorneys descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Robbers!&rsquo; shouted Mr. Pickwick, breaking from Lowten and Perker, and
      thrusting his head out of the staircase window.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Pickwick drew in his head again, his countenance was smiling and
      placid; and, walking quietly back into the office, he declared that he had
      now removed a great weight from his mind, and that he felt perfectly
      comfortable and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perker said nothing at all until he had emptied his snuff-box, and sent
      Lowten out to fill it, when he was seized with a fit of laughing, which
      lasted five minutes; at the expiration of which time he said that he
      supposed he ought to be very angry, but he couldn&rsquo;t think of the business
      seriously yet&mdash;when he could, he would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, now,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;let me have a settlement with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the same kind as the last?&rsquo; inquired Perker, with another laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not exactly,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick, drawing out his pocket-book, and
      shaking the little man heartily by the hand, &lsquo;I only mean a pecuniary
      settlement. You have done me many acts of kindness that I can never repay,
      and have no wish to repay, for I prefer continuing the obligation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this preface, the two friends dived into some very complicated
      accounts and vouchers, which, having been duly displayed and gone through
      by Perker, were at once discharged by Mr. Pickwick with many professions
      of esteem and friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had no sooner arrived at this point, than a most violent and
      startling knocking was heard at the door; it was not an ordinary
      double-knock, but a constant and uninterrupted succession of the loudest
      single raps, as if the knocker were endowed with the perpetual motion, or
      the person outside had forgotten to leave off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; exclaimed Perker, starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it is a knock at the door,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as if there could
      be the smallest doubt of the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knocker made a more energetic reply than words could have yielded, for
      it continued to hammer with surprising force and noise, without a moment&rsquo;s
      cessation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; said Perker, ringing his bell, &lsquo;we shall alarm the inn. Mr.
      Lowten, don&rsquo;t you hear a knock?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll answer the door in one moment, Sir,&rsquo; replied the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knocker appeared to hear the response, and to assert that it was quite
      impossible he could wait so long. It made a stupendous uproar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s quite dreadful,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, stopping his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Make haste, Mr. Lowten,&rsquo; Perker called out; &lsquo;we shall have the panels
      beaten in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lowten, who was washing his hands in a dark closet, hurried to the
      door, and turning the handle, beheld the appearance which is described in
      the next chapter.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he object that
      presented itself to the eyes of the astonished clerk, was a boy&mdash;a
      wonderfully fat boy&mdash;habited as a serving lad, standing upright on
      the mat, with his eyes closed as if in sleep. He had never seen such a fat
      boy, in or out of a travelling caravan; and this, coupled with the
      calmness and repose of his appearance, so very different from what was
      reasonably to have been expected of the inflicter of such knocks, smote
      him with wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; inquired the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extraordinary boy replied not a word; but he nodded once, and seemed,
      to the clerk&rsquo;s imagination, to snore feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where do you come from?&rsquo; inquired the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy made no sign. He breathed heavily, but in all other respects was
      motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk repeated the question thrice, and receiving no answer, prepared
      to shut the door, when the boy suddenly opened his eyes, winked several
      times, sneezed once, and raised his hand as if to repeat the knocking.
      Finding the door open, he stared about him with astonishment, and at
      length fixed his eyes on Mr. Lowten&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What the devil do you knock in that way for?&rsquo; inquired the clerk angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which way?&rsquo; said the boy, in a slow and sleepy voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, like forty hackney-coachmen,&rsquo; replied the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because master said, I wasn&rsquo;t to leave off knocking till they opened the
      door, for fear I should go to sleep,&rsquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the clerk, &lsquo;what message have you brought?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s downstairs,&rsquo; rejoined the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Master. He wants to know whether you&rsquo;re at home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lowten bethought himself, at this juncture, of looking out of the
      window. Seeing an open carriage with a hearty old gentleman in it, looking
      up very anxiously, he ventured to beckon him; on which, the old gentleman
      jumped out directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s your master in the carriage, I suppose?&rsquo; said Lowten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      All further inquiries were superseded by the appearance of old Wardle,
      who, running upstairs and just recognising Lowten, passed at once into Mr.
      Perker&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pickwick!&rsquo; said the old gentleman. &lsquo;Your hand, my boy! Why have I never
      heard until the day before yesterday of your suffering yourself to be
      cooped up in jail? And why did you let him do it, Perker?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it, my dear Sir,&rsquo; replied Perker, with a smile and a
      pinch of snuff; &lsquo;you know how obstinate he is?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I do; of course I do,&rsquo; replied the old gentleman. &lsquo;I am
      heartily glad to see him, notwithstanding. I will not lose sight of him
      again, in a hurry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Wardle shook Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s hand once more, and, having
      done the same by Perker, threw himself into an arm-chair, his jolly red
      face shining again with smiles and health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Wardle. &lsquo;Here are pretty goings on&mdash;a pinch of your
      snuff, Perker, my boy&mdash;never were such times, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mean!&rsquo; replied Wardle. &lsquo;Why, I think the girls are all running mad;
      that&rsquo;s no news, you&rsquo;ll say? Perhaps it&rsquo;s not; but it&rsquo;s true, for all
      that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not come up to London, of all places in the world, to tell us
      that, my dear Sir, have you?&rsquo; inquired Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not altogether,&rsquo; replied Wardle; &lsquo;though it was the main cause of my
      coming. How&rsquo;s Arabella?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;and will be delighted to see you, I am
      sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Black-eyed little jilt!&rsquo; replied Wardle. &lsquo;I had a great idea of marrying
      her myself, one of these odd days. But I am glad of it too, very glad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did the intelligence reach you?&rsquo; asked Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it came to my girls, of course,&rsquo; replied Wardle. &lsquo;Arabella wrote, the
      day before yesterday, to say she had made a stolen match without her
      husband&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s consent, and so you had gone down to get it when his
      refusing it couldn&rsquo;t prevent the match, and all the rest of it. I thought
      it a very good time to say something serious to my girls; so I said what a
      dreadful thing it was that children should marry without their parents&rsquo; 
      consent, and so forth; but, bless your hearts, I couldn&rsquo;t make the least
      impression upon them. They thought it such a much more dreadful thing that
      there should have been a wedding without bridesmaids, that I might as well
      have preached to Joe himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the old gentleman stopped to laugh; and having done so to his heart&rsquo;s
      content, presently resumed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But this is not the best of it, it seems. This is only half the
      love-making and plotting that have been going forward. We have been
      walking on mines for the last six months, and they&rsquo;re sprung at last.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, turning pale; &lsquo;no other secret
      marriage, I hope?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; replied old Wardle; &lsquo;not so bad as that; no.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What then?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;am I interested in it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I answer that question, Perker?&rsquo; said Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t commit yourself by doing so, my dear Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well then, you are,&rsquo; said Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How?&rsquo; asked Mr. Pickwick anxiously. &lsquo;In what way?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really,&rsquo; replied Wardle, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re such a fiery sort of a young fellow that
      I am almost afraid to tell you; but, however, if Perker will sit between
      us to prevent mischief, I&rsquo;ll venture.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having closed the room door, and fortified himself with another
      application to Perker&rsquo;s snuff-box, the old gentleman proceeded with his
      great disclosure in these words&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fact is, that my daughter Bella&mdash;Bella, who married young
      Trundle, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, we know,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t alarm me at the very beginning. My daughter Bella&mdash;Emily
      having gone to bed with a headache after she had read Arabella&rsquo;s letter to
      me&mdash;sat herself down by my side the other evening, and began to talk
      over this marriage affair. &ldquo;Well, pa,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;what do you think of
      it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, my dear,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s all very well; I hope it&rsquo;s
      for the best.&rdquo; I answered in this way because I was sitting before the
      fire at the time, drinking my grog rather thoughtfully, and I knew my
      throwing in an undecided word now and then, would induce her to continue
      talking. Both my girls are pictures of their dear mother, and as I grow
      old I like to sit with only them by me; for their voices and looks carry
      me back to the happiest period of my life, and make me, for the moment, as
      young as I used to be then, though not quite so light-hearted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite
      a marriage of affection, pa,&rdquo; said Bella, after a short silence. &ldquo;Yes, my
      dear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but such marriages do not always turn out the happiest.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I question that, mind!&rsquo; interposed Mr. Pickwick warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; responded Wardle, &lsquo;question anything you like when it&rsquo;s your
      turn to speak, but don&rsquo;t interrupt me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Granted,&rsquo; replied Wardle. &lsquo;&ldquo;I am sorry to hear you express your opinion
      against marriages of affection, pa,&rdquo; said Bella, colouring a little. &ldquo;I
      was wrong; I ought not to have said so, my dear, either,&rdquo; said I, patting
      her cheek as kindly as a rough old fellow like me could pat it, &ldquo;for your
      mother&rsquo;s was one, and so was yours.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I meant, pa,&rdquo; said
      Bella. &ldquo;The fact is, pa, I wanted to speak to you about Emily.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rsquo; inquired Wardle, stopping in his narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Pray go on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never could spin out a story,&rsquo; said Wardle abruptly. &lsquo;It must come out,
      sooner or later, and it&rsquo;ll save us all a great deal of time if it comes at
      once. The long and the short of it is, then, that Bella at last mustered
      up courage to tell me that Emily was very unhappy; that she and your young
      friend Snodgrass had been in constant correspondence and communication
      ever since last Christmas; that she had very dutifully made up her mind to
      run away with him, in laudable imitation of her old friend and
      school-fellow; but that having some compunctions of conscience on the
      subject, inasmuch as I had always been rather kindly disposed to both of
      them, they had thought it better in the first instance to pay me the
      compliment of asking whether I would have any objection to their being
      married in the usual matter-of-fact manner. There now, Mr. Pickwick, if
      you can make it convenient to reduce your eyes to their usual size again,
      and to let me hear what you think we ought to do, I shall feel rather
      obliged to you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The testy manner in which the hearty old gentleman uttered this last
      sentence was not wholly unwarranted; for Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s face had settled
      down into an expression of blank amazement and perplexity, quite curious
      to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Snodgrass!&mdash;since last Christmas!&rsquo; were the first broken words that
      issued from the lips of the confounded gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Since last Christmas,&rsquo; replied Wardle; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s plain enough, and very bad
      spectacles we must have worn, not to have discovered it before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, ruminating; &lsquo;I cannot really
      understand it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s easy enough to understand it,&rsquo; replied the choleric old gentleman.
      &lsquo;If you had been a younger man, you would have been in the secret long
      ago; and besides,&rsquo; added Wardle, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, &lsquo;the truth
      is, that, knowing nothing of this matter, I have rather pressed Emily for
      four or five months past, to receive favourably (if she could; I would
      never attempt to force a girl&rsquo;s inclinations) the addresses of a young
      gentleman down in our neighbourhood. I have no doubt that, girl-like, to
      enhance her own value and increase the ardour of Mr. Snodgrass, she has
      represented this matter in very glowing colours, and that they have both
      arrived at the conclusion that they are a terribly-persecuted pair of
      unfortunates, and have no resource but clandestine matrimony, or charcoal.
      Now the question is, what&rsquo;s to be done?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have <i>you </i>done?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>I!</i>&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean what did you do when your married daughter told you this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I made a fool of myself of course,&rsquo; rejoined Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; interposed Perker, who had accompanied this dialogue with
      sundry twitchings of his watch-chain, vindictive rubbings of his nose, and
      other symptoms of impatience. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s very natural; but how?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I went into a great passion and frightened my mother into a fit,&rsquo; said
      Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was judicious,&rsquo; remarked Perker; &lsquo;and what else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fretted and fumed all next day, and raised a great disturbance,&rsquo; 
      rejoined the old gentleman. &lsquo;At last I got tired of rendering myself
      unpleasant and making everybody miserable; so I hired a carriage at
      Muggleton, and, putting my own horses in it, came up to town, under
      pretence of bringing Emily to see Arabella.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Wardle is with you, then?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure she is,&rsquo; replied Wardle. &lsquo;She is at Osborne&rsquo;s Hotel in the
      Adelphi at this moment, unless your enterprising friend has run away with
      her since I came out this morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are reconciled then?&rsquo; said Perker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit of it,&rsquo; answered Wardle; &lsquo;she has been crying and moping ever
      since, except last night, between tea and supper, when she made a great
      parade of writing a letter that I pretended to take no notice of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You want my advice in this matter, I suppose?&rsquo; said Perker, looking from
      the musing face of Mr. Pickwick to the eager countenance of Wardle, and
      taking several consecutive pinches of his favourite stimulant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose so,&rsquo; said Wardle, looking at Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; replied that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well then,&rsquo; said Perker, rising and pushing his chair back, &lsquo;my advice
      is, that you both walk away together, or ride away, or get away by some
      means or other, for I&rsquo;m tired of you, and just talk this matter over
      between you. If you have not settled it by the next time I see you, I&rsquo;ll
      tell you what to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is satisfactory,&rsquo; said Wardle, hardly knowing whether to smile or be
      offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pooh, pooh, my dear Sir,&rsquo; returned Perker. &lsquo;I know you both a great deal
      better than you know yourselves. You have settled it already, to all
      intents and purposes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus expressing himself, the little gentleman poked his snuff-box first
      into the chest of Mr. Pickwick, and then into the waistcoat of Mr. Wardle,
      upon which they all three laughed, especially the two last-named
      gentlemen, who at once shook hands again, without any obvious or
      particular reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You dine with me to-day,&rsquo; said Wardle to Perker, as he showed them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t promise, my dear Sir, can&rsquo;t promise,&rsquo; replied Perker. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll look
      in, in the evening, at all events.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall expect you at five,&rsquo; said Wardle. &lsquo;Now, Joe!&rsquo; And Joe having been
      at length awakened, the two friends departed in Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s carriage,
      which in common humanity had a dickey behind for the fat boy, who, if
      there had been a footboard instead, would have rolled off and killed
      himself in his very first nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Driving to the George and Vulture, they found that Arabella and her maid
      had sent for a hackney-coach immediately on the receipt of a short note
      from Emily announcing her arrival in town, and had proceeded straight to
      the Adelphi. As Wardle had business to transact in the city, they sent the
      carriage and the fat boy to his hotel, with the information that he and
      Mr. Pickwick would return together to dinner at five o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charged with this message, the fat boy returned, slumbering as peaceably
      in his dickey, over the stones, as if it had been a down bed on watch
      springs. By some extraordinary miracle he awoke of his own accord, when
      the coach stopped, and giving himself a good shake to stir up his
      faculties, went upstairs to execute his commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, whether the shake had jumbled the fat boy&rsquo;s faculties together,
      instead of arranging them in proper order, or had roused such a quantity
      of new ideas within him as to render him oblivious of ordinary forms and
      ceremonies, or (which is also possible) had proved unsuccessful in
      preventing his falling asleep as he ascended the stairs, it is an
      undoubted fact that he walked into the sitting-room without previously
      knocking at the door; and so beheld a gentleman with his arms clasping his
      young mistress&rsquo;s waist, sitting very lovingly by her side on a sofa, while
      Arabella and her pretty handmaid feigned to be absorbed in looking out of
      a window at the other end of the room. At the sight of this phenomenon,
      the fat boy uttered an interjection, the ladies a scream, and the
      gentleman an oath, almost simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wretched creature, what do you want here?&rsquo; said the gentleman, who it is
      needless to say was Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this the fat boy, considerably terrified, briefly responded, &lsquo;Missis.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want me for,&rsquo; inquired Emily, turning her head aside, &lsquo;you
      stupid creature?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Master and Mr. Pickwick is a-going to dine here at five,&rsquo; replied the fat
      boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave the room!&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass, glaring upon the bewildered youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, no,&rsquo; added Emily hastily. &lsquo;Bella, dear, advise me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, Emily and Mr. Snodgrass, and Arabella and Mary, crowded into a
      corner, and conversed earnestly in whispers for some minutes, during which
      the fat boy dozed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Joe,&rsquo; said Arabella, at length, looking round with a most bewitching
      smile, &lsquo;how do you do, Joe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Joe,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a very good boy; I won&rsquo;t forget you, Joe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Joe,&rsquo; said Mr. Snodgrass, advancing to the astonished youth, and seizing
      his hand, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you before. There&rsquo;s five shillings for you, Joe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll owe you five, Joe,&rsquo; said Arabella, &lsquo;for old acquaintance sake, you
      know;&rsquo; and another most captivating smile was bestowed upon the corpulent
      intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy&rsquo;s perception being slow, he looked rather puzzled at first to
      account for this sudden prepossession in his favour, and stared about him
      in a very alarming manner. At length his broad face began to show symptoms
      of a grin of proportionately broad dimensions; and then, thrusting
      half-a-crown into each of his pockets, and a hand and wrist after it, he
      burst into a horse laugh: being for the first and only time in his
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He understands us, I see,&rsquo; said Arabella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He had better have something to eat, immediately,&rsquo; remarked Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy almost laughed again when he heard this suggestion. Mary,
      after a little more whispering, tripped forth from the group and said&mdash;

    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going to dine with you to-day, sir, if you have no objection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This way,&rsquo; said the fat boy eagerly. &lsquo;There is such a jolly meat-pie!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, the fat boy led the way downstairs; his pretty companion
      captivating all the waiters and angering all the chambermaids as she
      followed him to the eating-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the meat-pie of which the youth had spoken so feelingly, and
      there were, moreover, a steak, and a dish of potatoes, and a pot of
      porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down,&rsquo; said the fat boy. &lsquo;Oh, my eye, how prime! I am <i>so</i>
      hungry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having apostrophised his eye, in a species of rapture, five or six times,
      the youth took the head of the little table, and Mary seated herself at
      the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you have some of this?&rsquo; said the fat boy, plunging into the pie up
      to the very ferules of the knife and fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little, if you please,&rsquo; replied Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy assisted Mary to a little, and himself to a great deal, and
      was just going to begin eating when he suddenly laid down his knife and
      fork, leaned forward in his chair, and letting his hands, with the knife
      and fork in them, fall on his knees, said, very slowly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say! How nice you look!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was said in an admiring manner, and was, so far, gratifying; but
      still there was enough of the cannibal in the young gentleman&rsquo;s eyes to
      render the compliment a double one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, Joseph,&rsquo; said Mary, affecting to blush, &lsquo;what do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy, gradually recovering his former position, replied with a
      heavy sigh, and, remaining thoughtful for a few moments, drank a long
      draught of the porter. Having achieved this feat, he sighed again, and
      applied himself assiduously to the pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a nice young lady Miss Emily is!&rsquo; said Mary, after a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy had by this time finished the pie. He fixed his eyes on Mary,
      and replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knows a nicerer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, indeed!&rsquo; replied the fat boy, with unwonted vivacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rsquo; inquired Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s yours?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So&rsquo;s hers,&rsquo; said the fat boy. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re her.&rsquo; The boy grinned to add point
      to the compliment, and put his eyes into something between a squint and a
      cast, which there is reason to believe he intended for an ogle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t talk to me in that way,&rsquo; said Mary; &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t mean it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t I, though?&rsquo; replied the fat boy. &lsquo;I say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you going to come here regular?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; rejoined Mary, shaking her head, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going away again to-night.
      Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said the fat boy, in a tone of strong feeling; &lsquo;how we should have
      enjoyed ourselves at meals, if you had been!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I might come here sometimes, perhaps, to see you,&rsquo; said Mary, plaiting
      the table-cloth in assumed coyness, &lsquo;if you would do me a favour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy looked from the pie-dish to the steak, as if he thought a
      favour must be in a manner connected with something to eat; and then took
      out one of the half-crowns and glanced at it nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand me?&rsquo; said Mary, looking slily in his fat face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he looked at the half-crown, and said faintly, &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The ladies want you not to say anything to the old gentleman about the
      young gentleman having been upstairs; and I want you too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; said the fat boy, evidently very much relieved, as he
      pocketed the half-crown again. &lsquo;Of course I ain&rsquo;t a-going to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;Mr. Snodgrass is very fond of Miss Emily, and Miss
      Emily&rsquo;s very fond of him, and if you were to tell about it, the old
      gentleman would carry you all away miles into the country, where you&rsquo;d see
      nobody.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, I won&rsquo;t tell,&rsquo; said the fat boy stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a dear,&rsquo; said Mary. &lsquo;Now it&rsquo;s time I went upstairs, and got my
      lady ready for dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go yet,&rsquo; urged the fat boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must,&rsquo; replied Mary. &lsquo;Good-bye, for the present.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy, with elephantine playfulness, stretched out his arms to
      ravish a kiss; but as it required no great agility to elude him, his fair
      enslaver had vanished before he closed them again; upon which the
      apathetic youth ate a pound or so of steak with a sentimental countenance,
      and fell fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was so much to say upstairs, and there were so many plans to concert
      for elopement and matrimony in the event of old Wardle continuing to be
      cruel, that it wanted only half an hour of dinner when Mr. Snodgrass took
      his final adieu. The ladies ran to Emily&rsquo;s bedroom to dress, and the
      lover, taking up his hat, walked out of the room. He had scarcely got
      outside the door, when he heard Wardle&rsquo;s voice talking loudly, and looking
      over the banisters beheld him, followed by some other gentlemen, coming
      straight upstairs. Knowing nothing of the house, Mr. Snodgrass in his
      confusion stepped hastily back into the room he had just quitted, and
      passing thence into an inner apartment (Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s bedchamber), closed
      the door softly, just as the persons he had caught a glimpse of entered
      the sitting-room. These were Mr. Wardle, Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Nathaniel
      Winkle, and Mr. Benjamin Allen, whom he had no difficulty in recognising
      by their voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very lucky I had the presence of mind to avoid them,&rsquo; thought Mr.
      Snodgrass with a smile, and walking on tiptoe to another door near the
      bedside; &lsquo;this opens into the same passage, and I can walk quietly and
      comfortably away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one obstacle to his walking quietly and comfortably away,
      which was that the door was locked and the key gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us have some of your best wine to-day, waiter,&rsquo; said old Wardle,
      rubbing his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall have some of the very best, sir,&rsquo; replied the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let the ladies know we have come in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Devoutly and ardently did Mr. Snodgrass wish that the ladies could know he
      had come in. He ventured once to whisper, &lsquo;Waiter!&rsquo; through the keyhole,
      but the probability of the wrong waiter coming to his relief, flashed upon
      his mind, together with a sense of the strong resemblance between his own
      situation and that in which another gentleman had been recently found in a
      neighbouring hotel (an account of whose misfortunes had appeared under the
      head of &lsquo;Police&rsquo; in that morning&rsquo;s paper), he sat himself on a
      portmanteau, and trembled violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We won&rsquo;t wait a minute for Perker,&rsquo; said Wardle, looking at his watch;
      &lsquo;he is always exact. He will be here, in time, if he means to come; and if
      he does not, it&rsquo;s of no use waiting. Ha! Arabella!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My sister!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Benjamin Allen, folding her in a most romantic
      embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Ben, dear, how you do smell of tobacco,&rsquo; said Arabella, rather
      overcome by this mark of affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do I?&rsquo; said Mr. Benjamin Allen. &lsquo;Do I, Bella? Well, perhaps I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he did, having just left a pleasant little smoking-party of twelve
      medical students, in a small back parlour with a large fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I am delighted to see you,&rsquo; said Mr. Ben Allen. &lsquo;Bless you, Bella!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There,&rsquo; said Arabella, bending forward to kiss her brother; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t take
      hold of me again, Ben, dear, because you tumble me so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point of the reconciliation, Mr. Ben Allen allowed his feelings
      and the cigars and porter to overcome him, and looked round upon the
      beholders with damp spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is nothing to be said to me?&rsquo; cried Wardle, with open arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A great deal,&rsquo; whispered Arabella, as she received the old gentleman&rsquo;s
      hearty caress and congratulation. &lsquo;You are a hard-hearted, unfeeling,
      cruel monster.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a little rebel,&rsquo; replied Wardle, in the same tone, &lsquo;and I am
      afraid I shall be obliged to forbid you the house. People like you, who
      get married in spite of everybody, ought not to be let loose on society.
      But come!&rsquo; added the old gentleman aloud, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s the dinner; you shall
      sit by me. Joe; why, damn the boy, he&rsquo;s awake!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To the great distress of his master, the fat boy was indeed in a state of
      remarkable vigilance, his eyes being wide open, and looking as if they
      intended to remain so. There was an alacrity in his manner, too, which was
      equally unaccountable; every time his eyes met those of Emily or Arabella,
      he smirked and grinned; once, Wardle could have sworn, he saw him wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      This alteration in the fat boy&rsquo;s demeanour originated in his increased
      sense of his own importance, and the dignity he acquired from having been
      taken into the confidence of the young ladies; and the smirks, and grins,
      and winks were so many condescending assurances that they might depend
      upon his fidelity. As these tokens were rather calculated to awaken
      suspicion than allay it, and were somewhat embarrassing besides, they were
      occasionally answered by a frown or shake of the head from Arabella, which
      the fat boy, considering as hints to be on his guard, expressed his
      perfect understanding of, by smirking, grinning, and winking, with
      redoubled assiduity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Joe,&rsquo; said Mr. Wardle, after an unsuccessful search in all his pockets,
      &lsquo;is my snuff-box on the sofa?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; replied the fat boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I recollect; I left it on my dressing-table this morning,&rsquo; said
      Wardle. &lsquo;Run into the next room and fetch it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy went into the next room; and, having been absent about a
      minute, returned with the snuff-box, and the palest face that ever a fat
      boy wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the boy?&rsquo; exclaimed Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothen&rsquo;s the matter with me,&rsquo; replied Joe nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you been seeing any spirits?&rsquo; inquired the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or taking any?&rsquo; added Ben Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you&rsquo;re right,&rsquo; whispered Wardle across the table. &lsquo;He is
      intoxicated, I&rsquo;m sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben Allen replied that he thought he was; and, as that gentleman had seen
      a vast deal of the disease in question, Wardle was confirmed in an
      impression which had been hovering about his mind for half an hour, and at
      once arrived at the conclusion that the fat boy was drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just keep your eye upon him for a few minutes,&rsquo; murmured Wardle. &lsquo;We
      shall soon find out whether he is or not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate youth had only interchanged a dozen words with Mr.
      Snodgrass, that gentleman having implored him to make a private appeal to
      some friend to release him, and then pushed him out with the snuff-box,
      lest his prolonged absence should lead to a discovery. He ruminated a
      little with a most disturbed expression of face, and left the room in
      search of Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mary had gone home after dressing her mistress, and the fat boy came
      back again more disturbed than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardle and Mr. Ben Allen exchanged glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Joe!&rsquo; said Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you go away for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy looked hopelessly in the face of everybody at table, and
      stammered out that he didn&rsquo;t know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Wardle, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t know, eh? Take this cheese to Mr. Pickwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Mr. Pickwick being in the very best health and spirits, had been
      making himself perfectly delightful all dinner-time, and was at this
      moment engaged in an energetic conversation with Emily and Mr. Winkle;
      bowing his head, courteously, in the emphasis of his discourse, gently
      waving his left hand to lend force to his observations, and all glowing
      with placid smiles. He took a piece of cheese from the plate, and was on
      the point of turning round to renew the conversation, when the fat boy,
      stooping so as to bring his head on a level with that of Mr. Pickwick,
      pointed with his thumb over his shoulder, and made the most horrible and
      hideous face that was ever seen out of a Christmas pantomime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, starting, &lsquo;what a very&mdash;Eh?&rsquo; He
      stopped, for the fat boy had drawn himself up, and was, or pretended to
      be, fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; inquired Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is such an extremely singular lad!&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, looking
      uneasily at the boy. &lsquo;It seems an odd thing to say, but upon my word I am
      afraid that, at times, he is a little deranged.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Mr. Pickwick, pray don&rsquo;t say so,&rsquo; cried Emily and Arabella, both at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not certain, of course,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, amidst profound silence
      and looks of general dismay; &lsquo;but his manner to me this moment really was
      very alarming. Oh!&rsquo; ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, suddenly jumping up with a
      short scream. &lsquo;I beg your pardon, ladies, but at that moment he ran some
      sharp instrument into my leg. Really, he is not safe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s drunk,&rsquo; roared old Wardle passionately. &lsquo;Ring the bell! Call the
      waiters! He&rsquo;s drunk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the fat boy, falling on his knees as his master seized him
      by the collar. &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t drunk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you&rsquo;re mad; that&rsquo;s worse. Call the waiters,&rsquo; said the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t mad; I&rsquo;m sensible,&rsquo; rejoined the fat boy, beginning to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, what the devil did you run sharp instruments into Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      legs for?&rsquo; inquired Wardle angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t look at me,&rsquo; replied the boy. &lsquo;I wanted to speak to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you want to say?&rsquo; asked half a dozen voices at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat boy gasped, looked at the bedroom door, gasped again, and wiped
      two tears away with the knuckle of each of his forefingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you want to say?&rsquo; demanded Wardle, shaking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;allow me. What did you wish to communicate to
      me, my poor boy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to whisper to you,&rsquo; replied the fat boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You want to bite his ear off, I suppose,&rsquo; said Wardle. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t come near
      him; he&rsquo;s vicious; ring the bell, and let him be taken downstairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Mr. Winkle caught the bell-rope in his hand, it was arrested by a
      general expression of astonishment; the captive lover, his face burning
      with confusion, suddenly walked in from the bedroom, and made a
      comprehensive bow to the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo!&rsquo; cried Wardle, releasing the fat boy&rsquo;s collar, and staggering
      back. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been concealed in the next room, sir, since you returned,&rsquo; 
      explained Mr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Emily, my girl,&rsquo; said Wardle reproachfully, &lsquo;I detest meanness and
      deceit; this is unjustifiable and indelicate in the highest degree. I
      don&rsquo;t deserve this at your hands, Emily, indeed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear papa,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;Arabella knows&mdash;everybody here knows&mdash;Joe
      knows&mdash;that I was no party to this concealment. Augustus, for
      Heaven&rsquo;s sake, explain it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Snodgrass, who had only waited for a hearing, at once recounted how he
      had been placed in his then distressing predicament; how the fear of
      giving rise to domestic dissensions had alone prompted him to avoid Mr.
      Wardle on his entrance; how he merely meant to depart by another door,
      but, finding it locked, had been compelled to stay against his will. It
      was a painful situation to be placed in; but he now regretted it the less,
      inasmuch as it afforded him an opportunity of acknowledging, before their
      mutual friends, that he loved Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s daughter deeply and sincerely;
      that he was proud to avow that the feeling was mutual; and that if
      thousands of miles were placed between them, or oceans rolled their
      waters, he could never for an instant forget those happy days, when first&mdash;et
      cetera, et cetera.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having delivered himself to this effect, Mr. Snodgrass bowed again, looked
      into the crown of his hat, and stepped towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; shouted Wardle. &lsquo;Why, in the name of all that&rsquo;s&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Inflammable,&rsquo; mildly suggested Mr. Pickwick, who thought something worse
      was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well&mdash;that&rsquo;s inflammable,&rsquo; said Wardle, adopting the substitute;
      &lsquo;couldn&rsquo;t you say all this to me in the first instance?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or confide in me?&rsquo; added Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear, dear,&rsquo; said Arabella, taking up the defence, &lsquo;what is the use of
      asking all that now, especially when you know you had set your covetous
      old heart on a richer son-in-law, and are so wild and fierce besides, that
      everybody is afraid of you, except me? Shake hands with him, and order him
      some dinner, for goodness gracious&rsquo; sake, for he looks half starved; and
      pray have your wine up at once, for you&rsquo;ll not be tolerable until you have
      taken two bottles at least.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy old gentleman pulled Arabella&rsquo;s ear, kissed her without the
      smallest scruple, kissed his daughter also with great affection, and shook
      Mr. Snodgrass warmly by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is right on one point at all events,&rsquo; said the old gentleman
      cheerfully. &lsquo;Ring for the wine!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The wine came, and Perker came upstairs at the same moment. Mr. Snodgrass
      had dinner at a side table, and, when he had despatched it, drew his chair
      next Emily, without the smallest opposition on the old gentleman&rsquo;s part.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening was excellent. Little Mr. Perker came out wonderfully, told
      various comic stories, and sang a serious song which was almost as funny
      as the anecdotes. Arabella was very charming, Mr. Wardle very jovial, Mr.
      Pickwick very harmonious, Mr. Ben Allen very uproarious, the lovers very
      silent, Mr. Winkle very talkative, and all of them very happy.

      CHAPTER LV. MR. SOLOMON PELL, ASSISTED BY A SELECT COMMITTEE OF COACHMEN,
      ARRANGES THE AFFAIRS OF THE ELDER MR. WELLER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>amivel,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Weller, accosting his son on the morning after the funeral, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve found
      it, Sammy. I thought it wos there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thought wot wos there?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your mother-in-law&rsquo;s vill, Sammy,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller. &lsquo;In wirtue o&rsquo; 
      vich, them arrangements is to be made as I told you on, last night,
      respectin&rsquo; the funs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot, didn&rsquo;t she tell you were it wos?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit on it, Sammy,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller. &lsquo;We wos a adjestin&rsquo; our
      little differences, and I wos a-cheerin&rsquo; her spirits and bearin&rsquo; her up,
      so that I forgot to ask anythin&rsquo; about it. I don&rsquo;t know as I should ha&rsquo; 
      done it, indeed, if I had remembered it,&rsquo; added Mr. Weller, &lsquo;for it&rsquo;s a
      rum sort o&rsquo; thing, Sammy, to go a-hankerin&rsquo; arter anybody&rsquo;s property, ven
      you&rsquo;re assistin&rsquo; &lsquo;em in illness. It&rsquo;s like helping an outside passenger
      up, ven he&rsquo;s been pitched off a coach, and puttin&rsquo; your hand in his
      pocket, vile you ask him, vith a sigh, how he finds his-self, Sammy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this figurative illustration of his meaning, Mr. Weller unclasped his
      pocket-book, and drew forth a dirty sheet of letter-paper, on which were
      inscribed various characters crowded together in remarkable confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This here is the dockyment, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller. &lsquo;I found it in the
      little black tea-pot, on the top shelf o&rsquo; the bar closet. She used to keep
      bank-notes there, &lsquo;fore she vos married, Samivel. I&rsquo;ve seen her take the
      lid off, to pay a bill, many and many a time. Poor creetur, she might ha&rsquo; 
      filled all the tea-pots in the house vith vills, and not have
      inconwenienced herself neither, for she took wery little of anythin&rsquo; in
      that vay lately, &lsquo;cept on the temperance nights, ven they just laid a
      foundation o&rsquo; tea to put the spirits atop on!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does it say?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jist vot I told you, my boy,&rsquo; rejoined his parent. &lsquo;Two hundred pound
      vurth o&rsquo; reduced counsels to my son-in-law, Samivel, and all the rest o&rsquo; 
      my property, of ev&rsquo;ry kind and description votsoever, to my husband, Mr.
      Tony Veller, who I appint as my sole eggzekiter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all, is it?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller. &lsquo;And I s&rsquo;pose as it&rsquo;s all right and
      satisfactory to you and me as is the only parties interested, ve may as
      vell put this bit o&rsquo; paper into the fire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot are you a-doin&rsquo; on, you lunatic?&rsquo; said Sam, snatching the paper away,
      as his parent, in all innocence, stirred the fire preparatory to suiting
      the action to the word. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a nice eggzekiter, you are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vy not?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller, looking sternly round, with the poker in
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vy not?&rsquo; exclaimed Sam. &lsquo;&rsquo;Cos it must be proved, and probated, and swore
      to, and all manner o&rsquo; formalities.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that?&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, laying down the poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam buttoned the will carefully in a side pocket; intimating by a look,
      meanwhile, that he did mean it, and very seriously too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you wot it is,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, after a short meditation,
      &lsquo;this is a case for that &lsquo;ere confidential pal o&rsquo; the Chancellorship&rsquo;s.
      Pell must look into this, Sammy. He&rsquo;s the man for a difficult question at
      law. Ve&rsquo;ll have this here brought afore the Solvent Court, directly,
      Samivel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never did see such a addle-headed old creetur!&rsquo; exclaimed Sam
      irritably; &lsquo;Old Baileys, and Solvent Courts, and alleybis, and ev&rsquo;ry
      species o&rsquo; gammon alvays a-runnin&rsquo; through his brain. You&rsquo;d better get
      your out o&rsquo; door clothes on, and come to town about this bisness, than
      stand a-preachin&rsquo; there about wot you don&rsquo;t understand nothin&rsquo; on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good, Sammy,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m quite agreeable to anythin&rsquo; 
      as vill hexpedite business, Sammy. But mind this here, my boy, nobody but
      Pell&mdash;nobody but Pell as a legal adwiser.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want anybody else,&rsquo; replied Sam. &lsquo;Now, are you a-comin&rsquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vait a minit, Sammy,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, who, having tied his shawl with
      the aid of a small glass that hung in the window, was now, by dint of the
      most wonderful exertions, struggling into his upper garments. &lsquo;Vait a
      minit&rsquo; Sammy; ven you grow as old as your father, you von&rsquo;t get into your
      veskit quite as easy as you do now, my boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I couldn&rsquo;t get into it easier than that, I&rsquo;m blessed if I&rsquo;d vear vun
      at all,&rsquo; rejoined his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think so now,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, with the gravity of age, &lsquo;but you&rsquo;ll
      find that as you get vider, you&rsquo;ll get viser. Vidth and visdom, Sammy,
      alvays grows together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Weller delivered this infallible maxim&mdash;the result of many
      years&rsquo; personal experience and observation&mdash;he contrived, by a
      dexterous twist of his body, to get the bottom button of his coat to
      perform its office. Having paused a few seconds to recover breath, he
      brushed his hat with his elbow, and declared himself ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As four heads is better than two, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, as they drove
      along the London Road in the chaise-cart, &lsquo;and as all this here property
      is a wery great temptation to a legal gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, ve&rsquo;ll take a couple o&rsquo; 
      friends o&rsquo; mine vith us, as&rsquo;ll be wery soon down upon him if he comes
      anythin&rsquo; irreg&rsquo;lar; two o&rsquo; them as saw you to the Fleet that day. They&rsquo;re
      the wery best judges,&rsquo; added Mr. Weller, in a half-whisper&mdash;&lsquo;the wery
      best judges of a horse, you ever know&rsquo;d.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And of a lawyer too?&rsquo; inquired Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man as can form a ackerate judgment of a animal, can form a ackerate
      judgment of anythin&rsquo;,&rsquo; replied his father, so dogmatically, that Sam did
      not attempt to controvert the position.
    </p>
    <p>
      In pursuance of this notable resolution, the services of the mottled-faced
      gentleman and of two other very fat coachmen&mdash;selected by Mr. Weller,
      probably, with a view to their width and consequent wisdom&mdash;were put
      into requisition; and this assistance having been secured, the party
      proceeded to the public-house in Portugal Street, whence a messenger was
      despatched to the Insolvent Court over the way, requiring Mr. Solomon
      Pell&rsquo;s immediate attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The messenger fortunately found Mr. Solomon Pell in court, regaling
      himself, business being rather slack, with a cold collation of an
      Abernethy biscuit and a saveloy. The message was no sooner whispered in
      his ear than he thrust them in his pocket among various professional
      documents, and hurried over the way with such alacrity that he reached the
      parlour before the messenger had even emancipated himself from the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mr. Pell, touching his hat, &lsquo;my service to you all. I
      don&rsquo;t say it to flatter you, gentlemen, but there are not five other men
      in the world, that I&rsquo;d have come out of that court for, to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So busy, eh?&rsquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Busy!&rsquo; replied Pell; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m completely sewn up, as my friend the late Lord
      Chancellor many a time used to say to me, gentlemen, when he came out from
      hearing appeals in the House of Lords. Poor fellow; he was very
      susceptible to fatigue; he used to feel those appeals uncommonly. I
      actually thought more than once that he&rsquo;d have sunk under &lsquo;em; I did,
      indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Pell shook his head and paused; on which, the elder Mr. Weller,
      nudging his neighbour, as begging him to mark the attorney&rsquo;s high
      connections, asked whether the duties in question produced any permanent
      ill effects on the constitution of his noble friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think he ever quite recovered them,&rsquo; replied Pell; &lsquo;in fact I&rsquo;m
      sure he never did. &ldquo;Pell,&rdquo; he used to say to me many a time, &ldquo;how the
      blazes you can stand the head-work you do, is a mystery to me.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
       I used to answer, &ldquo;I hardly know how I do it, upon my life.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Pell,&rdquo;
       he&rsquo;d add, sighing, and looking at me with a little envy&mdash;friendly
      envy, you know, gentlemen, mere friendly envy; I never minded it&mdash;&ldquo;Pell,
      you&rsquo;re a wonder; a wonder.&rdquo; Ah! you&rsquo;d have liked him very much if you had
      known him, gentlemen. Bring me three-penn&rsquo;orth of rum, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Addressing this latter remark to the waitress, in a tone of subdued grief,
      Mr. Pell sighed, looked at his shoes and the ceiling; and, the rum having
      by that time arrived, drank it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;However,&rsquo; said Pell, drawing a chair to the table, &lsquo;a professional man
      has no right to think of his private friendships when his legal assistance
      is wanted. By the bye, gentlemen, since I saw you here before, we have had
      to weep over a very melancholy occurrence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pell drew out a pocket-handkerchief, when he came to the word weep,
      but he made no further use of it than to wipe away a slight tinge of rum
      which hung upon his upper lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw it in the ADVERTISER, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; continued Pell. &lsquo;Bless my soul,
      not more than fifty-two! Dear me&mdash;only think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These indications of a musing spirit were addressed to the mottled-faced
      man, whose eyes Mr. Pell had accidentally caught; on which, the
      mottled-faced man, whose apprehension of matters in general was of a foggy
      nature, moved uneasily in his seat, and opined that, indeed, so far as
      that went, there was no saying how things was brought about; which
      observation, involving one of those subtle propositions which it is
      difficult to encounter in argument, was controverted by nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard it remarked that she was a very fine woman, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; 
      said Pell, in a sympathising manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir, she wos,&rsquo; replied the elder Mr. Weller, not much relishing this
      mode of discussing the subject, and yet thinking that the attorney, from
      his long intimacy with the late Lord Chancellor, must know best on all
      matters of polite breeding. &lsquo;She wos a wery fine &lsquo;ooman, sir, ven I first
      know&rsquo;d her. She wos a widder, sir, at that time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, it&rsquo;s curious,&rsquo; said Pell, looking round with a sorrowful smile;
      &lsquo;Mrs. Pell was a widow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s very extraordinary,&rsquo; said the mottled-faced man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it is a curious coincidence,&rsquo; said Pell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; gruffly remarked the elder Mr. Weller. &lsquo;More widders is
      married than single wimin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good, very good,&rsquo; said Pell, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re quite right, Mr. Weller. Mrs.
      Pell was a very elegant and accomplished woman; her manners were the theme
      of universal admiration in our neighbourhood. I was proud to see that
      woman dance; there was something so firm and dignified, and yet natural,
      in her motion. Her cutting, gentlemen, was simplicity itself. Ah! well,
      well! Excuse my asking the question, Mr. Samuel,&rsquo; continued the attorney
      in a lower voice, &lsquo;was your mother-in-law tall?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not wery,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Pell was a tall figure,&rsquo; said Pell, &lsquo;a splendid woman, with a noble
      shape, and a nose, gentlemen, formed to command and be majestic. She was
      very much attached to me&mdash;very much&mdash;highly connected, too. Her
      mother&rsquo;s brother, gentlemen, failed for eight hundred pounds, as a law
      stationer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, who had grown rather restless during this
      discussion, &lsquo;vith regard to bis&rsquo;ness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The word was music to Pell&rsquo;s ears. He had been revolving in his mind
      whether any business was to be transacted, or whether he had been merely
      invited to partake of a glass of brandy-and-water, or a bowl of punch, or
      any similar professional compliment, and now the doubt was set at rest
      without his appearing at all eager for its solution. His eyes glistened as
      he laid his hat on the table, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the business upon which&mdash;um? Either of these gentlemen wish
      to go through the court? We require an arrest; a friendly arrest will do,
      you know; we are all friends here, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me the dockyment, Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, taking the will from his
      son, who appeared to enjoy the interview amazingly. &lsquo;Wot we rekvire, sir,
      is a probe o&rsquo; this here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Probate, my dear Sir, probate,&rsquo; said Pell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller sharply, &lsquo;probe and probe it, is wery much
      the same; if you don&rsquo;t understand wot I mean, sir, I des-say I can find
      them as does.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No offence, I hope, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said Pell meekly. &lsquo;You are the executor,
      I see,&rsquo; he added, casting his eyes over the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These other gentlemen, I presume, are legatees, are they?&rsquo; inquired Pell,
      with a congratulatory smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sammy is a leg-at-ease,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller; &lsquo;these other gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n is
      friends o&rsquo; mine, just come to see fair; a kind of umpires.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Pell, &lsquo;very good. I have no objections, I&rsquo;m sure. I shall want
      a matter of five pound of you before I begin, ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It being decided by the committee that the five pound might be advanced,
      Mr. Weller produced that sum; after which, a long consultation about
      nothing particular took place, in the course whereof Mr. Pell demonstrated
      to the perfect satisfaction of the gentlemen who saw fair, that unless the
      management of the business had been intrusted to him, it must all have
      gone wrong, for reasons not clearly made out, but no doubt sufficient.
      This important point being despatched, Mr. Pell refreshed himself with
      three chops, and liquids both malt and spirituous, at the expense of the
      estate; and then they all went away to Doctors&rsquo; Commons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day there was another visit to Doctors&rsquo; Commons, and a great
      to-do with an attesting hostler, who, being inebriated, declined swearing
      anything but profane oaths, to the great scandal of a proctor and
      surrogate. Next week, there were more visits to Doctors&rsquo; Commons, and
      there was a visit to the Legacy Duty Office besides, and there were
      treaties entered into, for the disposal of the lease and business, and
      ratifications of the same, and inventories to be made out, and lunches to
      be taken, and dinners to be eaten, and so many profitable things to be
      done, and such a mass of papers accumulated that Mr. Solomon Pell, and the
      boy, and the blue bag to boot, all got so stout that scarcely anybody
      would have known them for the same man, boy, and bag, that had loitered
      about Portugal Street, a few days before.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length all these weighty matters being arranged, a day was fixed for
      selling out and transferring the stock, and of waiting with that view upon
      Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, stock-broker, of somewhere near the bank, who
      had been recommended by Mr. Solomon Pell for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a kind of festive occasion, and the parties were attired
      accordingly. Mr. Weller&rsquo;s tops were newly cleaned, and his dress was
      arranged with peculiar care; the mottled-faced gentleman wore at his
      button-hole a full-sized dahlia with several leaves; and the coats of his
      two friends were adorned with nosegays of laurel and other evergreens. All
      three were habited in strict holiday costume; that is to say, they were
      wrapped up to the chins, and wore as many clothes as possible, which is,
      and has been, a stage-coachman&rsquo;s idea of full dress ever since
      stage-coaches were invented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pell was waiting at the usual place of meeting at the appointed time;
      even he wore a pair of gloves and a clean shirt, much frayed at the collar
      and wristbands by frequent washings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A quarter to two,&rsquo; said Pell, looking at the parlour clock. &lsquo;If we are
      with Mr. Flasher at a quarter past, we shall just hit the best time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What should you say to a drop o&rsquo; beer, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n?&rsquo; suggested the
      mottled-faced man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a little bit o&rsquo; cold beef,&rsquo; said the second coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or a oyster,&rsquo; added the third, who was a hoarse gentleman, supported by
      very round legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear, hear!&rsquo; said Pell; &lsquo;to congratulate Mr. Weller, on his coming into
      possession of his property, eh? Ha! ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m quite agreeable, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n,&rsquo; answered Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Sammy, pull the
      bell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sammy complied; and the porter, cold beef, and oysters being promptly
      produced, the lunch was done ample justice to. Where everybody took so
      active a part, it is almost invidious to make a distinction; but if one
      individual evinced greater powers than another, it was the coachman with
      the hoarse voice, who took an imperial pint of vinegar with his oysters,
      without betraying the least emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pell, Sir,&rsquo; said the elder Mr. Weller, stirring a glass of
      brandy-and-water, of which one was placed before every gentleman when the
      oyster shells were removed&mdash;&lsquo;Mr. Pell, Sir, it wos my intention to
      have proposed the funs on this occasion, but Samivel has vispered to me&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Samuel Weller, who had silently eaten his oysters with tranquil
      smiles, cried, &lsquo;Hear!&rsquo; in a very loud voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;Has vispered to me,&rsquo; resumed his father, &lsquo;that it vould be better
      to dewote the liquor to vishin&rsquo; you success and prosperity, and thankin&rsquo; 
      you for the manner in which you&rsquo;ve brought this here business through.
      Here&rsquo;s your health, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold hard there,&rsquo; interposed the mottled-faced gentleman, with sudden
      energy; &lsquo;your eyes on me, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/20498m.jpg" alt="20498m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20498.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Saying this, the mottled-faced gentleman rose, as did the other gentlemen.
      The mottled-faced gentleman reviewed the company, and slowly lifted his
      hand, upon which every man (including him of the mottled countenance) drew
      a long breath, and lifted his tumbler to his lips. In one instant, the
      mottled-faced gentleman depressed his hand again, and every glass was set
      down empty. It is impossible to describe the thrilling effect produced by
      this striking ceremony. At once dignified, solemn, and impressive, it
      combined every element of grandeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mr. Pell, &lsquo;all I can say is, that such marks of
      confidence must be very gratifying to a professional man. I don&rsquo;t wish to
      say anything that might appear egotistical, gentlemen, but I&rsquo;m very glad,
      for your own sakes, that you came to me; that&rsquo;s all. If you had gone to
      any low member of the profession, it&rsquo;s my firm conviction, and I assure
      you of it as a fact, that you would have found yourselves in Queer Street
      before this. I could have wished my noble friend had been alive to have
      seen my management of this case. I don&rsquo;t say it out of pride, but I think&mdash;However,
      gentlemen, I won&rsquo;t trouble you with that. I&rsquo;m generally to be found here,
      gentlemen, but if I&rsquo;m not here, or over the way, that&rsquo;s my address. You&rsquo;ll
      find my terms very cheap and reasonable, and no man attends more to his
      clients than I do, and I hope I know a little of my profession besides. If
      you have any opportunity of recommending me to any of your friends,
      gentlemen, I shall be very much obliged to you, and so will they too, when
      they come to know me. Your healths, gentlemen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this expression of his feelings, Mr. Solomon Pell laid three small
      written cards before Mr. Weller&rsquo;s friends, and, looking at the clock
      again, feared it was time to be walking. Upon this hint Mr. Weller settled
      the bill, and, issuing forth, the executor, legatee, attorney, and
      umpires, directed their steps towards the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The office of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, of the Stock Exchange, was in a
      first floor up a court behind the Bank of England; the house of Wilkins
      Flasher, Esquire, was at Brixton, Surrey; the horse and stanhope of
      Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, were at an adjacent livery stable; the groom of
      Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, was on his way to the West End to deliver some
      game; the clerk of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, had gone to his dinner; and
      so Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, himself, cried, &lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; when Mr. Pell and
      his companions knocked at the counting-house door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-morning, Sir,&rsquo; said Pell, bowing obsequiously. &lsquo;We want to make a
      little transfer, if you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, just come in, will you?&rsquo; said Mr. Flasher. &lsquo;Sit down a minute; I&rsquo;ll
      attend to you directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, Sir,&rsquo; said Pell, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s no hurry. Take a chair, Mr. Weller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller took a chair, and Sam took a box, and the umpires took what
      they could get, and looked at the almanac and one or two papers which were
      wafered against the wall, with as much open-eyed reverence as if they had
      been the finest efforts of the old masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll bet you half a dozen of claret on it; come!&rsquo; said Wilkins
      Flasher, Esquire, resuming the conversation to which Mr. Pell&rsquo;s entrance
      had caused a momentary interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was addressed to a very smart young gentleman who wore his hat on his
      right whisker, and was lounging over the desk, killing flies with a ruler.
      Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, was balancing himself on two legs of an office
      stool, spearing a wafer-box with a penknife, which he dropped every now
      and then with great dexterity into the very centre of a small red wafer
      that was stuck outside. Both gentlemen had very open waistcoats and very
      rolling collars, and very small boots, and very big rings, and very little
      watches, and very large guard-chains, and symmetrical inexpressibles, and
      scented pocket-handkerchiefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never bet half a dozen!&rsquo; said the other gentleman. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take a dozen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Done, Simmery, done!&rsquo; said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;P. P., mind,&rsquo; observed the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; replied Wilkins Flasher, Esquire. Wilkins Flasher, Esquire,
      entered it in a little book, with a gold pencil-case, and the other
      gentleman entered it also, in another little book with another gold
      pencil-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see there&rsquo;s a notice up this morning about Boffer,&rsquo; observed Mr.
      Simmery. &lsquo;Poor devil, he&rsquo;s expelled the house!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you ten guineas to five, he cuts his throat,&rsquo; said Wilkins
      Flasher, Esquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Done,&rsquo; replied Mr. Simmery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop! I bar,&rsquo; said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, thoughtfully. &lsquo;Perhaps he
      may hang himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Simmery, pulling out the gold pencil-case again.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no objection to take you that way. Say, makes away with himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kills himself, in fact,&rsquo; said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; replied Mr. Simmery, putting it down. &lsquo;&ldquo;Flasher&mdash;ten
      guineas to five, Boffer kills himself.&rdquo; Within what time shall we say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A fortnight?&rsquo; suggested Wilkins Flasher, Esquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Con-found it, no,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Simmery, stopping for an instant to smash
      a fly with the ruler. &lsquo;Say a week.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Split the difference,&rsquo; said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire. &lsquo;Make it ten days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well; ten days,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Simmery.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was entered down on the little books that Boffer was to kill himself
      within ten days, or Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, was to hand over to Frank
      Simmery, Esquire, the sum of ten guineas; and that if Boffer did kill
      himself within that time, Frank Simmery, Esquire, would pay to Wilkins
      Flasher, Esquire, five guineas, instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry he has failed,&rsquo; said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire. &lsquo;Capital
      dinners he gave.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fine port he had too,&rsquo; remarked Mr. Simmery. &lsquo;We are going to send our
      butler to the sale to-morrow, to pick up some of that sixty-four.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The devil you are!&rsquo; said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire. &lsquo;My man&rsquo;s going too.
      Five guineas my man outbids your man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another entry was made in the little books, with the gold pencil-cases;
      and Mr. Simmery, having by this time killed all the flies and taken all
      the bets, strolled away to the Stock Exchange to see what was going
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, now condescended to receive Mr. Solomon Pell&rsquo;s
      instructions, and having filled up some printed forms, requested the party
      to follow him to the bank, which they did: Mr. Weller and his three
      friends staring at all they beheld in unbounded astonishment, and Sam
      encountering everything with a coolness which nothing could disturb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing a courtyard which was all noise and bustle, and passing a couple
      of porters who seemed dressed to match the red fire engine which was
      wheeled away into a corner, they passed into an office where their
      business was to be transacted, and where Pell and Mr. Flasher left them
      standing for a few moments, while they went upstairs into the Will Office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot place is this here?&rsquo; whispered the mottled-faced gentleman to the
      elder Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Counsel&rsquo;s Office,&rsquo; replied the executor in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot are them gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men a-settin&rsquo; behind the counters?&rsquo; asked the hoarse
      coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Reduced counsels, I s&rsquo;pose,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t they the reduced
      counsels, Samivel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wy, you don&rsquo;t suppose the reduced counsels is alive, do you?&rsquo; inquired
      Sam, with some disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How should I know?&rsquo; retorted Mr. Weller; &lsquo;I thought they looked wery like
      it. Wot are they, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clerks,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot are they all a-eatin&rsquo; ham sangwidges for?&rsquo; inquired his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Cos it&rsquo;s in their dooty, I suppose,&rsquo; replied Sam, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a part o&rsquo; the
      system; they&rsquo;re alvays a-doin&rsquo; it here, all day long!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller and his friends had scarcely had a moment to reflect upon this
      singular regulation as connected with the monetary system of the country,
      when they were rejoined by Pell and Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, who led them
      to a part of the counter above which was a round blackboard with a large
      &lsquo;W.&rsquo; on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s that for, Sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Weller, directing Pell&rsquo;s attention to
      the target in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The first letter of the name of the deceased,&rsquo; replied Pell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, turning round to the umpires, there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; 
      wrong here. We&rsquo;s our letter&mdash;this won&rsquo;t do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The referees at once gave it as their decided opinion that the business
      could not be legally proceeded with, under the letter W., and in all
      probability it would have stood over for one day at least, had it not been
      for the prompt, though, at first sight, undutiful behaviour of Sam, who,
      seizing his father by the skirt of the coat, dragged him to the counter,
      and pinned him there, until he had affixed his signature to a couple of
      instruments; which, from Mr. Weller&rsquo;s habit of printing, was a work of so
      much labour and time, that the officiating clerk peeled and ate three
      Ribstone pippins while it was performing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the elder Mr. Weller insisted on selling out his portion forthwith,
      they proceeded from the bank to the gate of the Stock Exchange, to which
      Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, after a short absence, returned with a cheque on
      Smith, Payne, &amp; Smith, for five hundred and thirty pounds; that being
      the money to which Mr. Weller, at the market price of the day, was
      entitled, in consideration of the balance of the second Mrs. Weller&rsquo;s
      funded savings. Sam&rsquo;s two hundred pounds stood transferred to his name,
      and Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, having been paid his commission, dropped the
      money carelessly into his coat pocket, and lounged back to his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller was at first obstinately determined on cashing the cheque in
      nothing but sovereigns; but it being represented by the umpires that by so
      doing he must incur the expense of a small sack to carry them home in, he
      consented to receive the amount in five-pound notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My son,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, as they came out of the banking-house&mdash;&lsquo;my
      son and me has a wery partickler engagement this arternoon, and I should
      like to have this here bis&rsquo;ness settled out of hand, so let&rsquo;s jest go
      straight avay someveres, vere ve can hordit the accounts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A quiet room was soon found, and the accounts were produced and audited.
      Mr. Pell&rsquo;s bill was taxed by Sam, and some charges were disallowed by the
      umpires; but, notwithstanding Mr. Pell&rsquo;s declaration, accompanied with
      many solemn asseverations that they were really too hard upon him, it was
      by very many degrees the best professional job he had ever had, and one on
      which he boarded, lodged, and washed, for six months afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The umpires having partaken of a dram, shook hands and departed, as they
      had to drive out of town that night. Mr. Solomon Pell, finding that
      nothing more was going forward, either in the eating or drinking way, took
      a friendly leave, and Sam and his father were left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, thrusting his pocket-book in his side pocket.
      &lsquo;Vith the bills for the lease, and that, there&rsquo;s eleven hundred and eighty
      pound here. Now, Samivel, my boy, turn the horses&rsquo; heads to the George and
      Wulter!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER LVI. AN IMPORTANT CONFERENCE TAKES PLACE BETWEEN MR. PICKWICK AND
      SAMUEL WELLER, AT WHICH HIS PARENT ASSISTS&mdash;AN OLD GENTLEMAN IN A
      SNUFF-COLOURED SUIT ARRIVES UNEXPECTEDLY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Pickwick was
      sitting alone, musing over many things, and thinking among other
      considerations how he could best provide for the young couple whose
      present unsettled condition was matter of constant regret and anxiety to
      him, when Mary stepped lightly into the room, and, advancing to the table,
      said, rather hastily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, if you please, Sir, Samuel is downstairs, and he says may his father
      see you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, Sir,&rsquo; said Mary, tripping towards the door again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam has not been here long, has he?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mary eagerly. &lsquo;He has only just come home. He is
      not going to ask you for any more leave, Sir, he says.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary might have been conscious that she had communicated this last
      intelligence with more warmth than seemed actually necessary, or she might
      have observed the good-humoured smile with which Mr. Pickwick regarded
      her, when she had finished speaking. She certainly held down her head, and
      examined the corner of a very smart little apron, with more closeness than
      there appeared any absolute occasion for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell them they can come up at once, by all means,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary, apparently much relieved, hurried away with her message.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick took two or three turns up and down the room; and, rubbing
      his chin with his left hand as he did so, appeared lost in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, at length in a kind but somewhat
      melancholy tone, &lsquo;it is the best way in which I could reward him for his
      attachment and fidelity; let it be so, in Heaven&rsquo;s name. It is the fate of
      a lonely old man, that those about him should form new and different
      attachments and leave him. I have no right to expect that it should be
      otherwise with me. No, no,&rsquo; added Mr. Pickwick more cheerfully, &lsquo;it would
      be selfish and ungrateful. I ought to be happy to have an opportunity of
      providing for him so well. I am. Of course I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick had been so absorbed in these reflections, that a knock at
      the door was three or four times repeated before he heard it. Hastily
      seating himself, and calling up his accustomed pleasant looks, he gave the
      required permission, and Sam Weller entered, followed by his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Glad to see you back again, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;How do you do, Mr.
      Weller?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery hearty, thank&rsquo;ee, sir,&rsquo; replied the widower; &lsquo;hope I see you well,
      sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite, I thank you,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wanted to have a little bit o&rsquo; conwersation with you, sir,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Weller, &lsquo;if you could spare me five minits or so, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Sam, give your father a chair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, Samivel, I&rsquo;ve got a cheer here,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, bringing one
      forward as he spoke; &lsquo;uncommon fine day it&rsquo;s been, sir,&rsquo; added the old
      gentleman, laying his hat on the floor as he sat himself down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Remarkably so, indeed,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;Very seasonable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seasonablest veather I ever see, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Weller. Here, the old
      gentleman was seized with a violent fit of coughing, which, being
      terminated, he nodded his head and winked and made several supplicatory
      and threatening gestures to his son, all of which Sam Weller steadily
      abstained from seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick, perceiving that there was some embarrassment on the old
      gentleman&rsquo;s part, affected to be engaged in cutting the leaves of a book
      that lay beside him, and waited patiently until Mr. Weller should arrive
      at the object of his visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never see sich a aggrawatin&rsquo; boy as you are, Samivel,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller,
      looking indignantly at his son; &lsquo;never in all my born days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is he doing, Mr. Weller?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He von&rsquo;t begin, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Weller; &lsquo;he knows I ain&rsquo;t ekal to
      ex-pressin&rsquo; myself ven there&rsquo;s anythin&rsquo; partickler to be done, and yet
      he&rsquo;ll stand and see me a-settin&rsquo; here taking up your walable time, and
      makin&rsquo; a reg&rsquo;lar spectacle o&rsquo; myself, rayther than help me out vith a
      syllable. It ain&rsquo;t filial conduct, Samivel,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, wiping his
      forehead; &lsquo;wery far from it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You said you&rsquo;d speak,&rsquo; replied Sam; &lsquo;how should I know you wos done up at
      the wery beginnin&rsquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You might ha&rsquo; seen I warn&rsquo;t able to start,&rsquo; rejoined his father; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m on
      the wrong side of the road, and backin&rsquo; into the palin&rsquo;s, and all manner
      of unpleasantness, and yet you von&rsquo;t put out a hand to help me. I&rsquo;m
      ashamed on you, Samivel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fact is, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam, with a slight bow, &lsquo;the gov&rsquo;nor&rsquo;s been
      a-drawin&rsquo; his money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good, Samivel, wery good,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, nodding his head with a
      satisfied air, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to speak harsh to you, Sammy. Wery good.
      That&rsquo;s the vay to begin. Come to the pint at once. Wery good indeed,
      Samivel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller nodded his head an extraordinary number of times, in the excess
      of his gratification, and waited in a listening attitude for Sam to resume
      his statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may sit down, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, apprehending that the
      interview was likely to prove rather longer than he had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam bowed again and sat down; his father looking round, he continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The gov&rsquo;nor, sir, has drawn out five hundred and thirty pound.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Reduced counsels,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Weller, senior, in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It don&rsquo;t much matter vether it&rsquo;s reduced counsels, or wot not,&rsquo; said Sam;
      &lsquo;five hundred and thirty pounds is the sum, ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, Samivel,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To vich sum, he has added for the house and bisness&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lease, good-vill, stock, and fixters,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As much as makes it,&rsquo; continued Sam, &lsquo;altogether, eleven hundred and
      eighty pound.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;I am delighted to hear it. I congratulate
      you, Mr. Weller, on having done so well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vait a minit, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, raising his hand in a deprecatory
      manner. &lsquo;Get on, Samivel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This here money,&rsquo; said Sam, with a little hesitation, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s anxious to
      put someveres, vere he knows it&rsquo;ll be safe, and I&rsquo;m wery anxious too, for
      if he keeps it, he&rsquo;ll go a-lendin&rsquo; it to somebody, or inwestin&rsquo; property
      in horses, or droppin&rsquo; his pocket-book down an airy, or makin&rsquo; a Egyptian
      mummy of his-self in some vay or another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good, Samivel,&rsquo; observed Mr. Weller, in as complacent a manner as if
      Sam had been passing the highest eulogiums on his prudence and foresight.
      &lsquo;Wery good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For vich reasons,&rsquo; continued Sam, plucking nervously at the brim of his
      hat&mdash;&lsquo;for vich reasons, he&rsquo;s drawn it out to-day, and come here vith
      me to say, leastvays to offer, or in other vords&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To say this here,&rsquo; said the elder Mr. Weller impatiently, &lsquo;that it ain&rsquo;t
      o&rsquo; no use to me. I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to vork a coach reg&rsquo;lar, and ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got
      noveres to keep it in, unless I vos to pay the guard for takin&rsquo; care on
      it, or to put it in vun o&rsquo; the coach pockets, vich &lsquo;ud be a temptation to
      the insides. If you&rsquo;ll take care on it for me, sir, I shall be wery much
      obliged to you. P&rsquo;raps,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, walking up to Mr. Pickwick and
      whispering in his ear&mdash;&lsquo;p&rsquo;raps it&rsquo;ll go a little vay towards the
      expenses o&rsquo; that &lsquo;ere conwiction. All I say is, just you keep it till I
      ask you for it again.&rsquo; With these words, Mr. Weller placed the pocket-book
      in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s hands, caught up his hat, and ran out of the room with a
      celerity scarcely to be expected from so corpulent a subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop him, Sam!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick earnestly. &lsquo;Overtake him; bring
      him back instantly! Mr. Weller&mdash;here&mdash;come back!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam saw that his master&rsquo;s injunctions were not to be disobeyed; and,
      catching his father by the arm as he was descending the stairs, dragged
      him back by main force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good friend,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, taking the old man by the hand, &lsquo;your
      honest confidence overpowers me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see no occasion for nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the kind, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller
      obstinately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I assure you, my good friend, I have more money than I can ever need; far
      more than a man at my age can ever live to spend,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No man knows how much he can spend, till he tries,&rsquo; observed Mr. Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;but as I have no intention of trying
      any such experiments, I am not likely to come to want. I must beg you to
      take this back, Mr. Weller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Wery well,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, with a discontented look. &lsquo;Mark my vords,
      Sammy, I&rsquo;ll do somethin&rsquo; desperate vith this here property; somethin&rsquo; 
      desperate!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better not,&rsquo; replied Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller reflected for a short time, and then, buttoning up his coat
      with great determination, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll keep a pike.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot!&rsquo; exclaimed Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pike!&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Weller, through his set teeth; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll keep a pike.
      Say good-bye to your father, Samivel. I dewote the remainder of my days to
      a pike.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This threat was such an awful one, and Mr. Weller, besides appearing fully
      resolved to carry it into execution, seemed so deeply mortified by Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s refusal, that that gentleman, after a short reflection, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, Mr. Weller, I will keep your money. I can do more good with
      it, perhaps, than you can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just the wery thing, to be sure,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, brightening up; &lsquo;o&rsquo; 
      course you can, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say no more about it,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, locking the pocket-book in his
      desk; &lsquo;I am heartily obliged to you, my good friend. Now sit down again. I
      want to ask your advice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The internal laughter occasioned by the triumphant success of his visit,
      which had convulsed not only Mr. Weller&rsquo;s face, but his arms, legs, and
      body also, during the locking up of the pocket-book, suddenly gave place
      to the most dignified gravity as he heard these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait outside a few minutes, Sam, will you?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam immediately withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller looked uncommonly wise and very much amazed, when Mr. Pickwick
      opened the discourse by saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not an advocate for matrimony, I think, Mr. Weller?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller shook his head. He was wholly unable to speak; vague thoughts
      of some wicked widow having been successful in her designs on Mr.
      Pickwick, choked his utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you happen to see a young girl downstairs when you came in just now
      with your son?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. I see a young gal,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you think of her, now? Candidly, Mr. Weller, what did you think
      of her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought she wos wery plump, and vell made,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, with a
      critical air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So she is,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;so she is. What did you think of her
      manners, from what you saw of her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery pleasant,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Weller. &lsquo;Wery pleasant and comformable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The precise meaning which Mr. Weller attached to this last-mentioned
      adjective, did not appear; but, as it was evident from the tone in which
      he used it that it was a favourable expression, Mr. Pickwick was as well
      satisfied as if he had been thoroughly enlightened on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I take a great interest in her, Mr. Weller,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean an interest in her doing well,&rsquo; resumed Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;a desire
      that she may be comfortable and prosperous. You understand?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery clearly,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller, who understood nothing yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That young person,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;is attached to your son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Samivel Veller!&rsquo; exclaimed the parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s nat&rsquo;ral,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, after some consideration, &lsquo;nat&rsquo;ral, but
      rayther alarmin&rsquo;. Sammy must be careful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you mean?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery careful that he don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; to her,&rsquo; responded Mr. Weller.
      &lsquo;Wery careful that he ain&rsquo;t led avay, in a innocent moment, to say
      anythin&rsquo; as may lead to a conwiction for breach. You&rsquo;re never safe vith
      &lsquo;em, Mr. Pickwick, ven they vunce has designs on you; there&rsquo;s no knowin&rsquo; 
      vere to have &lsquo;em; and vile you&rsquo;re a-considering of it, they have you. I
      wos married fust, that vay myself, Sir, and Sammy wos the consekens o&rsquo; the
      manoover.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You give me no great encouragement to conclude what I have to say,&rsquo; 
      observed Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;but I had better do so at once. This young person
      is not only attached to your son, Mr. Weller, but your son is attached to
      her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vell,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, &lsquo;this here&rsquo;s a pretty sort o&rsquo; thing to come to a
      father&rsquo;s ears, this is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have observed them on several occasions,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, making no
      comment on Mr. Weller&rsquo;s last remark; &lsquo;and entertain no doubt at all about
      it. Supposing I were desirous of establishing them comfortably as man and
      wife in some little business or situation, where they might hope to obtain
      a decent living, what should you think of it, Mr. Weller?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, Mr. Weller received with wry faces a proposition involving the
      marriage of anybody in whom he took an interest; but, as Mr. Pickwick
      argued the point with him, and laid great stress on the fact that Mary was
      not a widow, he gradually became more tractable. Mr. Pickwick had great
      influence over him, and he had been much struck with Mary&rsquo;s appearance;
      having, in fact, bestowed several very unfatherly winks upon her, already.
      At length he said that it was not for him to oppose Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
      inclination, and that he would be very happy to yield to his advice; upon
      which, Mr. Pickwick joyfully took him at his word, and called Sam back
      into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, clearing his throat, &lsquo;your father and I have
      been having some conversation about you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About you, Samivel,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, in a patronising and impressive
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not so blind, Sam, as not to have seen, a long time since, that you
      entertain something more than a friendly feeling towards Mrs. Winkle&rsquo;s
      maid,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You hear this, Samivel?&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, in the same judicial form of
      speech as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam, addressing his master, &lsquo;I hope there&rsquo;s no harm in
      a young man takin&rsquo; notice of a young &lsquo;ooman as is undeniably good-looking
      and well-conducted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not by no means,&rsquo; acquiesced Mr. Weller, affably but magisterially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So far from thinking there is anything wrong in conduct so natural,&rsquo; 
      resumed Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;it is my wish to assist and promote your wishes in
      this respect. With this view, I have had a little conversation with your
      father; and finding that he is of my opinion&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The lady not bein&rsquo; a widder,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Weller in explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The lady not being a widow,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, smiling. &lsquo;I wish to free
      you from the restraint which your present position imposes upon you, and
      to mark my sense of your fidelity and many excellent qualities, by
      enabling you to marry this girl at once, and to earn an independent
      livelihood for yourself and family. I shall be proud, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Pickwick, whose voice had faltered a little hitherto, but now resumed its
      customary tone, &lsquo;proud and happy to make your future prospects in life my
      grateful and peculiar care.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a profound silence for a short time, and then Sam said, in a
      low, husky sort of voice, but firmly withal&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you for your goodness, Sir, as is only like
      yourself; but it can&rsquo;t be done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t be done!&rsquo; ejaculated Mr. Pickwick in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Samivel!&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say it can&rsquo;t be done,&rsquo; repeated Sam in a louder key. &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s to become
      of you, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good fellow,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;the recent changes among my
      friends will alter my mode of life in future, entirely; besides, I am
      growing older, and want repose and quiet. My rambles, Sam, are over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do I know that &lsquo;ere, sir?&rsquo; argued Sam. &lsquo;You think so now! S&rsquo;pose you
      wos to change your mind, vich is not unlikely, for you&rsquo;ve the spirit o&rsquo; 
      five-and-twenty in you still, what &lsquo;ud become on you vithout me? It can&rsquo;t
      be done, Sir, it can&rsquo;t be done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good, Samivel, there&rsquo;s a good deal in that,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller
      encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I speak after long deliberation, Sam, and with the certainty that I shall
      keep my word,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, shaking his head. &lsquo;New scenes have
      closed upon me; my rambles are at an end.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery good,&rsquo; rejoined Sam. &lsquo;Then, that&rsquo;s the wery best reason wy you
      should alvays have somebody by you as understands you, to keep you up and
      make you comfortable. If you vant a more polished sort o&rsquo; feller, vell and
      good, have him; but vages or no vages, notice or no notice, board or no
      board, lodgin&rsquo; or no lodgin&rsquo;, Sam Veller, as you took from the old inn in
      the Borough, sticks by you, come what may; and let ev&rsquo;rythin&rsquo; and
      ev&rsquo;rybody do their wery fiercest, nothin&rsquo; shall ever perwent it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of this declaration, which Sam made with great emotion, the
      elder Mr. Weller rose from his chair, and, forgetting all considerations
      of time, place, or propriety, waved his hat above his head, and gave three
      vehement cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good fellow,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, when Mr. Weller had sat down again,
      rather abashed at his own enthusiasm, &lsquo;you are bound to consider the young
      woman also.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do consider the young &lsquo;ooman, Sir,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;I have considered the
      young &lsquo;ooman. I&rsquo;ve spoke to her. I&rsquo;ve told her how I&rsquo;m sitivated; she&rsquo;s
      ready to vait till I&rsquo;m ready, and I believe she vill. If she don&rsquo;t, she&rsquo;s
      not the young &lsquo;ooman I take her for, and I give her up vith readiness.
      You&rsquo;ve know&rsquo;d me afore, Sir. My mind&rsquo;s made up, and nothin&rsquo; can ever alter
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Who could combat this resolution? Not Mr. Pickwick. He derived, at that
      moment, more pride and luxury of feeling from the disinterested attachment
      of his humble friends, than ten thousand protestations from the greatest
      men living could have awakened in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this conversation was passing in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s room, a little old
      gentleman in a suit of snuff-coloured clothes, followed by a porter
      carrying a small portmanteau, presented himself below; and, after securing
      a bed for the night, inquired of the waiter whether one Mrs. Winkle was
      staying there, to which question the waiter of course responded in the
      affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she alone?&rsquo; inquired the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe she is, Sir,&rsquo; replied the waiter; &lsquo;I can call her own maid,
      Sir, if you&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want her,&rsquo; said the old gentleman quickly. &lsquo;Show me to her
      room without announcing me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh, Sir?&rsquo; said the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you deaf?&rsquo; inquired the little old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then listen, if you please. Can you hear me now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s well. Show me to Mrs. Winkle&rsquo;s room, without announcing me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the little old gentleman uttered this command, he slipped five
      shillings into the waiter&rsquo;s hand, and looked steadily at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, sir,&rsquo; said the waiter, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir, whether&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you&rsquo;ll do it, I see,&rsquo; said the little old gentleman. &lsquo;You had better
      do it at once. It will save time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something so very cool and collected in the gentleman&rsquo;s manner,
      that the waiter put the five shillings in his pocket, and led him upstairs
      without another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the room, is it?&rsquo; said the gentleman. &lsquo;You may go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter complied, wondering much who the gentleman could be, and what
      he wanted; the little old gentleman, waiting till he was out of sight,
      tapped at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; said Arabella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Um, a pretty voice, at any rate,&rsquo; murmured the little old gentleman; &lsquo;but
      that&rsquo;s nothing.&rsquo; As he said this, he opened the door and walked in.
      Arabella, who was sitting at work, rose on beholding a stranger&mdash;a
      little confused&mdash;but by no means ungracefully so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t rise, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the unknown, walking in, and closing the
      door after him. &lsquo;Mrs. Winkle, I believe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arabella inclined her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Nathaniel Winkle, who married the son of the old man at Birmingham?&rsquo; 
      said the stranger, eyeing Arabella with visible curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Arabella inclined her head, and looked uneasily round, as if
      uncertain whether to call for assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I surprise you, I see, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather, I confess,&rsquo; replied Arabella, wondering more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take a chair, if you&rsquo;ll allow me, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took one; and drawing a spectacle-case from his pocket, leisurely
      pulled out a pair of spectacles, which he adjusted on his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know me, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; he said, looking so intently at Arabella that
      she began to feel alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; she replied timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the gentleman, nursing his left leg; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you
      should. You know my name, though, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do I?&rsquo; said Arabella, trembling, though she scarcely knew why. &lsquo;May I ask
      what it is?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Presently, ma&rsquo;am, presently,&rsquo; said the stranger, not having yet removed
      his eyes from her countenance. &lsquo;You have been recently married, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have,&rsquo; replied Arabella, in a scarcely audible tone, laying aside her
      work, and becoming greatly agitated as a thought, that had occurred to her
      before, struck more forcibly upon her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Without having represented to your husband the propriety of first
      consulting his father, on whom he is dependent, I think?&rsquo; said the
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arabella applied her handkerchief to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Without an endeavour, even, to ascertain, by some indirect appeal, what
      were the old man&rsquo;s sentiments on a point in which he would naturally feel
      much interested?&rsquo; said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot deny it, Sir,&rsquo; said Arabella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And without having sufficient property of your own to afford your husband
      any permanent assistance in exchange for the worldly advantages which you
      knew he would have gained if he had married agreeably to his father&rsquo;s
      wishes?&rsquo; said the old gentleman. &lsquo;This is what boys and girls call
      disinterested affection, till they have boys and girls of their own, and
      then they see it in a rougher and very different light!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arabella&rsquo;s tears flowed fast, as she pleaded in extenuation that she was
      young and inexperienced; that her attachment had alone induced her to take
      the step to which she had resorted; and that she had been deprived of the
      counsel and guidance of her parents almost from infancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was wrong,&rsquo; said the old gentleman in a milder tone, &lsquo;very wrong. It
      was romantic, unbusinesslike, foolish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was my fault; all my fault, Sir,&rsquo; replied poor Arabella, weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said the old gentleman; &lsquo;it was not your fault that he fell in
      love with you, I suppose? Yes it was, though,&rsquo; said the old gentleman,
      looking rather slily at Arabella. &lsquo;It was your fault. He couldn&rsquo;t help
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This little compliment, or the little gentleman&rsquo;s odd way of paying it, or
      his altered manner&mdash;so much kinder than it was, at first&mdash;or all
      three together, forced a smile from Arabella in the midst of her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s your husband?&rsquo; inquired the old gentleman, abruptly; stopping a
      smile which was just coming over his own face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I expect him every instant, sir,&rsquo; said Arabella. &lsquo;I persuaded him to take
      a walk this morning. He is very low and wretched at not having heard from
      his father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Low, is he?&rsquo; said the old gentlemen. &lsquo;Serve him right!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He feels it on my account, I am afraid,&rsquo; said Arabella; &lsquo;and indeed, Sir,
      I feel it deeply on his. I have been the sole means of bringing him to his
      present condition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind it on his account, my dear,&rsquo; said the old gentleman. &lsquo;It
      serves him right. I am glad of it&mdash;actually glad of it, as far as he
      is concerned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were scarcely out of the old gentleman&rsquo;s lips, when footsteps
      were heard ascending the stairs, which he and Arabella seemed both to
      recognise at the same moment. The little gentleman turned pale; and,
      making a strong effort to appear composed, stood up, as Mr. Winkle entered
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Father!&rsquo; cried Mr. Winkle, recoiling in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; replied the little old gentleman. &lsquo;Well, Sir, what have you
      got to say to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are ashamed of yourself, I hope, Sir?&rsquo; said the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Mr. Winkle said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you ashamed of yourself, Sir, or are you not?&rsquo; inquired the old
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle, drawing Arabella&rsquo;s arm through his. &lsquo;I am
      not ashamed of myself, or of my wife either.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word!&rsquo; cried the old gentleman ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very sorry to have done anything which has lessened your affection
      for me, Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle; &lsquo;but I will say, at the same time, that I
      have no reason to be ashamed of having this lady for my wife, nor you of
      having her for a daughter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me your hand, Nat,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, in an altered voice.
      &lsquo;Kiss me, my love. You are a very charming little daughter-in-law after
      all!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes&rsquo; time Mr. Winkle went in search of Mr. Pickwick, and
      returning with that gentleman, presented him to his father, whereupon they
      shook hands for five minutes incessantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pickwick, I thank you most heartily for all your kindness to my son,&rsquo; 
      said old Mr. Winkle, in a bluff, straightforward way. &lsquo;I am a hasty
      fellow, and when I saw you last, I was vexed and taken by surprise. I have
      judged for myself now, and am more than satisfied. Shall I make any more
      apologies, Mr. Pickwick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not one,&rsquo; replied that gentleman. &lsquo;You have done the only thing wanting
      to complete my happiness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon there was another shaking of hands for five minutes longer,
      accompanied by a great number of complimentary speeches, which, besides
      being complimentary, had the additional and very novel recommendation of
      being sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam had dutifully seen his father to the Belle Sauvage, when, on
      returning, he encountered the fat boy in the court, who had been charged
      with the delivery of a note from Emily Wardle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; said Joe, who was unusually loquacious, &lsquo;what a pretty girl Mary
      is, isn&rsquo;t she? I am <i>so</i> fond of her, I am!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Weller made no verbal remark in reply; but eyeing the fat boy for a
      moment, quite transfixed at his presumption, led him by the collar to the
      corner, and dismissed him with a harmless but ceremonious kick. After
      which, he walked home, whistling.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVII. IN WHICH THE PICKWICK CLUB IS FINALLY DISSOLVED, AND
      EVERYTHING CONCLUDED TO THE SATISFACTION OF EVERYBODY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>or a whole week
      after the happy arrival of Mr. Winkle from Birmingham, Mr. Pickwick and
      Sam Weller were from home all day long, only returning just in time for
      dinner, and then wearing an air of mystery and importance quite foreign to
      their natures. It was evident that very grave and eventful proceedings
      were on foot; but various surmises were afloat, respecting their precise
      character. Some (among whom was Mr. Tupman) were disposed to think that
      Mr. Pickwick contemplated a matrimonial alliance; but this idea the ladies
      most strenuously repudiated. Others rather inclined to the belief that he
      had projected some distant tour, and was at present occupied in effecting
      the preliminary arrangements; but this again was stoutly denied by Sam
      himself, who had unequivocally stated, when cross-examined by Mary, that
      no new journeys were to be undertaken. At length, when the brains of the
      whole party had been racked for six long days, by unavailing speculation,
      it was unanimously resolved that Mr. Pickwick should be called upon to
      explain his conduct, and to state distinctly why he had thus absented
      himself from the society of his admiring friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this view, Mr. Wardle invited the full circle to dinner at the
      Adelphi; and the decanters having been thrice sent round, opened the
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are all anxious to know,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, &lsquo;what we have done
      to offend you, and to induce you to desert us and devote yourself to these
      solitary walks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &lsquo;It is singular enough that I had intended
      to volunteer a full explanation this very day; so, if you will give me
      another glass of wine, I will satisfy your curiosity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The decanters passed from hand to hand with unwonted briskness, and Mr.
      Pickwick, looking round on the faces of his friends with a cheerful smile,
      proceeded&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the changes that have taken place among us,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;I
      mean the marriage that <i>has </i>taken place, and the marriage that WILL
      take place, with the changes they involve, rendered it necessary for me to
      think, soberly and at once, upon my future plans. I determined on retiring
      to some quiet, pretty neighbourhood in the vicinity of London; I saw a
      house which exactly suited my fancy; I have taken it and furnished it. It
      is fully prepared for my reception, and I intend entering upon it at once,
      trusting that I may yet live to spend many quiet years in peaceful
      retirement, cheered through life by the society of my friends, and
      followed in death by their affectionate remembrance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Pickwick paused, and a low murmur ran round the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The house I have taken,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;is at Dulwich. It has a
      large garden, and is situated in one of the most pleasant spots near
      London. It has been fitted up with every attention to substantial comfort;
      perhaps to a little elegance besides; but of that you shall judge for
      yourselves. Sam accompanies me there. I have engaged, on Perker&rsquo;s
      representation, a housekeeper&mdash;a very old one&mdash;and such other
      servants as she thinks I shall require. I propose to consecrate this
      little retreat, by having a ceremony in which I take a great interest,
      performed there. I wish, if my friend Wardle entertains no objection, that
      his daughter should be married from my new house, on the day I take
      possession of it. The happiness of young people,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, a
      little moved, &lsquo;has ever been the chief pleasure of my life. It will warm
      my heart to witness the happiness of those friends who are dearest to me,
      beneath my own roof.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick paused again: Emily and Arabella sobbed audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have communicated, both personally and by letter, with the club,&rsquo; 
      resumed Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;acquainting them with my intention. During our long
      absence, it has suffered much from internal dissentions; and the
      withdrawal of my name, coupled with this and other circumstances, has
      occasioned its dissolution. The Pickwick Club exists no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall never regret,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick in a low voice, &lsquo;I shall never
      regret having devoted the greater part of two years to mixing with
      different varieties and shades of human character, frivolous as my pursuit
      of novelty may have appeared to many. Nearly the whole of my previous life
      having been devoted to business and the pursuit of wealth, numerous scenes
      of which I had no previous conception have dawned upon me&mdash;I hope to
      the enlargement of my mind, and the improvement of my understanding. If I
      have done but little good, I trust I have done less harm, and that none of
      my adventures will be other than a source of amusing and pleasant
      recollection to me in the decline of life. God bless you all!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Mr. Pickwick filled and drained a bumper with a
      trembling hand; and his eyes moistened as his friends rose with one
      accord, and pledged him from their hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were few preparatory arrangements to be made for the marriage of Mr.
      Snodgrass. As he had neither father nor mother, and had been in his
      minority a ward of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s, that gentleman was perfectly well
      acquainted with his possessions and prospects. His account of both was
      quite satisfactory to Wardle&mdash;as almost any other account would have
      been, for the good old gentleman was overflowing with hilarity and
      kindness&mdash;and a handsome portion having been bestowed upon Emily, the
      marriage was fixed to take place on the fourth day from that time&mdash;the
      suddenness of which preparations reduced three dressmakers and a tailor to
      the extreme verge of insanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting post-horses to the carriage, old Wardle started off, next day, to
      bring his mother back to town. Communicating his intelligence to the old
      lady with characteristic impetuosity, she instantly fainted away; but
      being promptly revived, ordered the brocaded silk gown to be packed up
      forthwith, and proceeded to relate some circumstances of a similar nature
      attending the marriage of the eldest daughter of Lady Tollimglower,
      deceased, which occupied three hours in the recital, and were not half
      finished at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Trundle had to be informed of all the mighty preparations that were
      making in London; and, being in a delicate state of health, was informed
      thereof through Mr. Trundle, lest the news should be too much for her; but
      it was not too much for her, inasmuch as she at once wrote off to
      Muggleton, to order a new cap and a black satin gown, and moreover avowed
      her determination of being present at the ceremony. Hereupon, Mr. Trundle
      called in the doctor, and the doctor said Mrs. Trundle ought to know best
      how she felt herself, to which Mrs. Trundle replied that she felt herself
      quite equal to it, and that she had made up her mind to go; upon which the
      doctor, who was a wise and discreet doctor, and knew what was good for
      himself, as well as for other people, said that perhaps if Mrs. Trundle
      stopped at home, she might hurt herself more by fretting, than by going,
      so perhaps she had better go. And she did go; the doctor with great
      attention sending in half a dozen of medicine, to be drunk upon the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to these points of distraction, Wardle was intrusted with two
      small letters to two small young ladies who were to act as bridesmaids;
      upon the receipt of which, the two young ladies were driven to despair by
      having no &lsquo;things&rsquo; ready for so important an occasion, and no time to make
      them in&mdash;a circumstance which appeared to afford the two worthy papas
      of the two small young ladies rather a feeling of satisfaction than
      otherwise. However, old frocks were trimmed, and new bonnets made, and the
      young ladies looked as well as could possibly have been expected of them.
      And as they cried at the subsequent ceremony in the proper places, and
      trembled at the right times, they acquitted themselves to the admiration
      of all beholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the two poor relations ever reached London&mdash;whether they walked,
      or got behind coaches, or procured lifts in wagons, or carried each other
      by turns&mdash;is uncertain; but there they were, before Wardle; and the
      very first people that knocked at the door of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s house, on the
      bridal morning, were the two poor relations, all smiles and shirt collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were welcomed heartily though, for riches or poverty had no influence
      on Mr. Pickwick; the new servants were all alacrity and readiness; Sam was
      in a most unrivalled state of high spirits and excitement; Mary was
      glowing with beauty and smart ribands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bridegroom, who had been staying at the house for two or three days
      previous, sallied forth gallantly to Dulwich Church to meet the bride,
      attended by Mr. Pickwick, Ben Allen, Bob Sawyer, and Mr. Tupman; with Sam
      Weller outside, having at his button-hole a white favour, the gift of his
      lady-love, and clad in a new and gorgeous suit of livery invented for the
      occasion. They were met by the Wardles, and the Winkles, and the bride and
      bridesmaids, and the Trundles; and the ceremony having been performed, the
      coaches rattled back to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s to breakfast, where little Mr.
      Perker already awaited them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, all the light clouds of the more solemn part of the proceedings
      passed away; every face shone forth joyously; and nothing was to be heard
      but congratulations and commendations. Everything was so beautiful! The
      lawn in front, the garden behind, the miniature conservatory, the
      dining-room, the drawing-room, the bedrooms, the smoking-room, and, above
      all, the study, with its pictures and easy-chairs, and odd cabinets, and
      queer tables, and books out of number, with a large cheerful window
      opening upon a pleasant lawn and commanding a pretty landscape, dotted
      here and there with little houses almost hidden by the trees; and then the
      curtains, and the carpets, and the chairs, and the sofas! Everything was
      so beautiful, so compact, so neat, and in such exquisite taste, said
      everybody, that there really was no deciding what to admire most.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the midst of all this, stood Mr. Pickwick, his countenance lighted
      up with smiles, which the heart of no man, woman, or child, could resist:
      himself the happiest of the group: shaking hands, over and over again,
      with the same people, and when his own hands were not so employed, rubbing
      them with pleasure: turning round in a different direction at every fresh
      expression of gratification or curiosity, and inspiring everybody with his
      looks of gladness and delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast is announced. Mr. Pickwick leads the old lady (who has been very
      eloquent on the subject of Lady Tollimglower) to the top of a long table;
      Wardle takes the bottom; the friends arrange themselves on either side;
      Sam takes his station behind his master&rsquo;s chair; the laughter and talking
      cease; Mr. Pickwick, having said grace, pauses for an instant and looks
      round him. As he does so, the tears roll down his cheeks, in the fullness
      of his joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us leave our old friend in one of those moments of unmixed happiness,
      of which, if we seek them, there are ever some, to cheer our transitory
      existence here. There are dark shadows on the earth, but its lights are
      stronger in the contrast. Some men, like bats or owls, have better eyes
      for the darkness than for the light. We, who have no such optical powers,
      are better pleased to take our last parting look at the visionary
      companions of many solitary hours, when the brief sunshine of the world is
      blazing full upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the fate of most men who mingle with the world, and attain even the
      prime of life, to make many real friends, and lose them in the course of
      nature. It is the fate of all authors or chroniclers to create imaginary
      friends, and lose them in the course of art. Nor is this the full extent
      of their misfortunes; for they are required to furnish an account of them
      besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      In compliance with this custom&mdash;unquestionably a bad one&mdash;we
      subjoin a few biographical words, in relation to the party at Mr.
      Pickwick&rsquo;s assembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Winkle, being fully received into favour by the old
      gentleman, were shortly afterwards installed in a newly-built house, not
      half a mile from Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s. Mr. Winkle, being engaged in the city as
      agent or town correspondent of his father, exchanged his old costume for
      the ordinary dress of Englishmen, and presented all the external
      appearance of a civilised Christian ever afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Snodgrass settled at Dingley Dell, where they purchased and
      cultivated a small farm, more for occupation than profit. Mr. Snodgrass,
      being occasionally abstracted and melancholy, is to this day reputed a
      great poet among his friends and acquaintance, although we do not find
      that he has ever written anything to encourage the belief. There are many
      celebrated characters, literary, philosophical, and otherwise, who hold a
      high reputation on a similar tenure.

    <p>
      Mr. Tupman, when his friends married, and Mr. Pickwick settled, took
      lodgings at Richmond, where he has ever since resided. He walks constantly
      on the terrace during the summer months, with a youthful and jaunty air,
      which has rendered him the admiration of the numerous elderly ladies of
      single condition, who reside in the vicinity. He has never proposed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bob Sawyer, having previously passed through the <i>Gazette</i>,
      passed over to Bengal, accompanied by Mr. Benjamin Allen; both gentlemen
      having received surgical appointments from the East India Company. They
      each had the yellow fever fourteen times, and then resolved to try a
      little abstinence; since which period, they have been doing well. Mrs.
      Bardell let lodgings to many conversable single gentlemen, with great
      profit, but never brought any more actions for breach of promise of
      marriage. Her attorneys, Messrs. Dodson &amp; Fogg, continue in business,
      from which they realise a large income, and in which they are universally
      considered among the sharpest of the sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam Weller kept his word, and remained unmarried, for two years. The old
      housekeeper dying at the end of that time, Mr. Pickwick promoted Mary to
      the situation, on condition of her marrying Mr. Weller at once, which she
      did without a murmur. From the circumstance of two sturdy little boys
      having been repeatedly seen at the gate of the back garden, there is
      reason to suppose that Sam has some family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Mr. Weller drove a coach for twelve months, but being afflicted
      with the gout, was compelled to retire. The contents of the pocket-book
      had been so well invested for him, however, by Mr. Pickwick, that he had a
      handsome independence to retire on, upon which he still lives at an
      excellent public-house near Shooter&rsquo;s Hill, where he is quite reverenced
      as an oracle, boasting very much of his intimacy with Mr. Pickwick, and
      retaining a most unconquerable aversion to widows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pickwick himself continued to reside in his new house, employing his
      leisure hours in arranging the memoranda which he afterwards presented to
      the secretary of the once famous club, or in hearing Sam Weller read
      aloud, with such remarks as suggested themselves to his mind, which never
      failed to afford Mr. Pickwick great amusement. He was much troubled at
      first, by the numerous applications made to him by Mr. Snodgrass, Mr.
      Winkle, and Mr. Trundle, to act as godfather to their offspring; but he
      has become used to it now, and officiates as a matter of course. He never
      had occasion to regret his bounty to Mr. Jingle; for both that person and
      Job Trotter became, in time, worthy members of society, although they have
      always steadily objected to return to the scenes of their old haunts and
      temptations. Mr. Pickwick is somewhat infirm now; but he retains all his
      former juvenility of spirit, and may still be frequently seen,
      contemplating the pictures in the Dulwich Gallery, or enjoying a walk
      about the pleasant neighbourhood on a fine day. He is known by all the
      poor people about, who never fail to take their hats off, as he passes,
      with great respect. The children idolise him, and so indeed does the whole
      neighbourhood. Every year he repairs to a large family merry-making at Mr.
      Wardle&rsquo;s; on this, as on all other occasions, he is invariably attended by
      the faithful Sam, between whom and his master there exists a steady and
      reciprocal attachment which nothing but death will terminate.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
