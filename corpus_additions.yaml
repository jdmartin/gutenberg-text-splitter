  # GODWIN, St Leon (1799)
  # ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # Strengthens Godwin coverage alongside Caleb Williams. Mary Shelley
  # acknowledged St Leon's influence on Frankenstein (forbidden knowledge,
  # isolation). Two Godwin novels let Sextant distinguish author-level
  # style from specific thematic vocabulary that carried to Frankenstein.
  # Also enriches negative control space: Lovelace almost certainly
  # never read St Leon.
  #
  # PG #53707. 1831 Colburn & Bentley "Standard Novels" edition.

  # titles ("TRAVELS OF ST. LEON", "CHAP. I", etc.)

  # Pervasive-influence baseline. The KJB is so culturally saturated
  # that its vocabulary appears everywhere in English prose. Including
  # it lets Sextant calibrate what "background influence" looks like
  # vs specific literary transmission. Methodological work: shows the
  # model can distinguish pervasive cultural influence from targeted
  # literary influence.

# NOTE ON PERCY SHELLEY, Defence of Poetry (1821)
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Already processed as part of PG #5428 in shelley_lovelace.yaml:
#   prefix: 1840-ENG18400--Shelley_Percy
#   Contains: Defence of Poetry + 9 other essays (10 sections)
#   Dated 1840 (posthumous publication by Mary Shelley)
#
# The full essay collection is preferable to the Defence alone
# because it gives Sextant more Percy prose for stylistic profiling,
# which strengthens confound detection. The Defence is section 10
# of the existing output.
#
# If you want the Defence as a STANDALONE text dated 1821 (when
# written, not published), uncomment below and also add it to
# the input/ directory. But this would create overlap with the
# existing Shelley_Percy entry -- the same text appearing in two
# corpus positions. Decide which dating/framing serves the thesis
# better before uncommenting.
